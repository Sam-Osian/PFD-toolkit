In advance of responding to the specific concerns raised in your Report, I would like to express my deep condolences to Joel’s family and loved ones. NHS England are keen to assure the family and the Coroner that the concerns raised about Joel’s care have been listened to and reflected upon.\\n\\nIn your Report, you raised that the NHS Pathways system does not differentiate between types of, severity of or the drugs / chemicals reported as being the cause of an overdose. The system also does not take into account the amount reported as ingested, the timing of ingestion or the patient's weight. In the case of sodium nitrite ingestion, treatment is only effective if medications are administered before the patient suffers a cardiac arrest. The Coroner’s view is that the Pathways system does not reflect the time sensitive nature for an effective response.\\n\\nThe NHS Pathways Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is a triage product that is used to support call handlers (health advisors) in urgent and emergency care (UEC) services. The product is owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and is manufactured and managed by the Transformation Directorate of NHS England. It is used in NHS 111 and over half of 999 ambulance services.\\n\\nNHS Pathways is an interlinked series of algorithms, or pathways, that link questions and care advice to lead to clinical endpoints known as “dispositions”. The system presents a series of questions in order that the most appropriate clinical response or disposition may be determined based on the presenting symptoms. A disposition will specify the skill set and time frame that a patient requires and, where required, appropriate care/worsening advice is provided.\\n\\nNHS Pathways is built around a clinical hierarchy, meaning that life-threatening symptoms are assessed at the start of the call to trigger ambulance responses, progressing through to less urgent symptoms which require a less urgent response (or disposition) in other settings. NHS Pathways is not diagnostic, but instead works on the basis of 'ruling out'.\\n\\nClinical Governance of the NHS Pathways Product\\n\\nThe safety of the clinical triage process endpoints resulting from a 111 or 999 assessment using NHS Pathways, is overseen by the National Clinical Assurance Group (NCAG), an independent intercollegiate group hosted by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC). This group is made up of representatives from Medical Royal Colleges and other clinical professional bodies and groups. Senior clinicians from these organisations provide independent oversight and scrutiny of the NHS Pathways clinical content. The group considers all aspects of the triage process, including the impact on services, as well as the evidence base for changes to the clinical content. All changes to, and development of, the core telephone system and other platforms, are formally documented and presented for a critique in accordance with agreed processes endorsed by NCAG.\\n\\nAlongside this independent oversight, NHS Pathways ensures its clinical content and assessment protocols are consistent with the latest advice from respected bodies that provide evidence and guidance for clinical practice in the UK.\\n\\nOverview of the Management of Overdoses and Suicidal Callers\\n\\nAmbulance Emergency Operation Centres (EOCs) use one of two approved triage tools to take 999 emergency calls – AMPDS or NHS Pathways. The outcome (disposition) reached at the conclusion of the initial assessment must be mapped to approved, contracted standards. There is a requirement to map these outcomes to the various categories (Categories 1 – 5) set out within the NHS Constitution and Ambulance Service 999 contracts. Category 5 (originally Category 4H) relates to calls that do not require an ambulance response; there is no standard for Category 5 calls.\\n\\nThe grading of 999 calls are clinically based decisions and any changes are considered by the NHS England Emergency Call Prioritisation Advisory Group (ECPAG), based on receipt of a review of the evidence base with formal recommendations from the NHS England Clinical Coding Review Group (CCRG), with endorsement of the clinical rationale of proposed changes by the National Ambulance Service Medical Directors group (NASMeD). Any recommendations that are made and implemented will be formally reviewed with ongoing monitoring from ECPAG.\\n\\nOverdoses, whether intentional or accidental, can be challenging cases to assess remotely; many different substances, medicines, doses and combinations are possible. This poses challenges to classify and appraise the relative lethality of the substances involved and balance this risk against the symptoms and circumstances at the time of the call. Where an overdose has occurred, and in the absence of signs or symptoms indicating an immediate life-threat (reduced consciousness level, breathlessness or shock, for example), the lowest disposition that can be reached is a Category 3 ambulance response. A higher response will be reached where there are symptoms indicating an immediate threat to life.\\n\\nAmbulance EOCs follow specific principles on their respective triage tool to ensure clinical oversight for patients calling and presenting with overdose and suicidal ideations. These principles have been reviewed and strengthened through several national recommendations since 2019.\\n\\nFirstly, on 2 April 2019, Professor [REDACTED] – the then National Clinical Director for Urgent and Emergency Care at NHS England – wrote to ambulance trusts and NHS 111 providers to mandate that robust clinical oversight was in place in control rooms and call centres to monitor self-harm and suicidal patients safely and effectively.\\n\\nSecondly, in 2020, the then Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB), investigated the potentially under-recognised risk of harm from the use of propranolol. They made a safety recommendation for NHS England to evaluate current approaches to clinical oversight of overdose calls within ambulance control rooms, and to develop a national framework to describe requirements for appropriate clinical oversight of overdose calls.\\n\\nIn April 2021, NHS England in conjunction with the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) published a new operational procedure for all ambulance services in England entitled, “Category 3/ 999 Overdose and Suicidal Ideation Calls; Initial Assessment of Lethality/Toxicity Principles Document”). This document followed a detailed review that had been undertaken to consider agreed ambulance control room processes, to ensure suicidal patients receive the correct clinical response. This review had also been the catalyst for NHS England contacting all ambulance and NHS 111 services in early 2019 as described above. The guidance highlights the critical importance of clinical oversight and review (rather than, for example, a re-categorisation of calls to Category 1 on a case-by-case basis) and sets out that:\\n\\n• where an overdose is declared, further clinical intervention should take place within 30 minutes, or the case must be automatically upgraded if this does not occur within 40 minutes.\\n• it is good practice for TOXBASE® (clinical toxicology database of the UK National Poisons Information Service) to be viewed for each overdose / accidental ingestion incident, despite the familiarity of the reviewing clinician with that particular toxicity profile, which includes sodium nitrite. It is noted that management practices often change in relation to specific toxins, therefore guidance around the use of TOXBASE® was issued instead. Utilising TOXBASE® similarly ensures that the relevant current guidance is accessed when managing emerging and novel substance ingestion enabling the clinician to assess risk on an individual case basis.\\n• the initial clinical review should also consider any ongoing suicidal ideation with a specific plan / means.\\n\\nMost recently, the overdose guidance was updated in November 2023 to include callers who reach a Category 5 disposition (hear and treat). This followed a review by ECPAG, NHS England and NASMeD, part of the AACE, to ensure it remained clinically fit for purpose. For those cases which do not automatically result in a Category 1 or 2 emergency ambulance response, an urgent remote clinical assessment will take place, pending which the case will be dealt with as a Category 3 emergency ambulance response. The objective of further remote clinical assessment is to determine the likely threat to the patient by gathering the clinical information about the substance(s) ingested and their quantities. Following this assessment, if the clinical view is that the case should be upgraded to a Category 1 or 2 emergency ambulance response, then this is done without delay.\\n\\nIn early 2019, NHS England also instructed ambulance and NHS 111 providers that any suicide-related cases reaching a Category 3 ambulance outcome should receive urgent clinical review. This would enable a clinician to consider the individual circumstances of each case, with a view to determining whether the case should be clinically upgraded to a Category 1 or 2 emergency ambulance response.\\n\\nIn response to this request, and in order to assist organisations in easily identifying the cases that needed an urgent clinical review, NHS Pathways introduced a new disposition code ‘Dx0124 Emergency Ambulance Response for Risk of Suicide (Category 3)’. This disposition code raises the visibility of such cases, enabling such urgent clinical review. This review by clinicians could involve re-triage to higher levels of response if required. It has also facilitated clearer visibility of such cases within the ambulance dispatch queue. This is in addition to information which was already fed into the dispatch system by NHS Pathways by way of ‘symptom discriminator codes’. NHS Pathways has a code identifying suicidal means and a plan (SD4244- AMB suicidal means and a plan). The disposition code was deployed to all service users as part of Release 18 in October 2019.\\n\\nShould national guidance or standards be amended such that toxic substances, where identified, impact on ambulance categorisation or disposition, NHS England would align the NHS Pathways system accordingly.\\n\\nYour second concern relates to the fact that it is not national protocol for ambulance services to carry antidote medication (Methylene Blue) for on-scene administration. You have raised that patients who have ingested [REDACTED] often enter cardiac arrest before arriving at an acute hospital within an Emergency Department.\\n\\nThe carrying of particular medication by ambulance services is an operational issue and is up to individual ambulance trusts; NHS England does not mandate such issues. NHS England is aware of a small number of ambulance specialist units who carry Methylene Blue. This antidote is carried by specialist clinical teams for administration in cases of moderate/severe [REDACTED] poisoning which can be measured through an exhaled breath monitor. Clinical feedback suggests it is likely Methylene Blue would not be used except for severe cases or where there is a long journey time to definitive care.\\n\\nI would also like to provide further assurances on the national NHS England work taking place around the Reports to Prevent Future Deaths. All reports received are discussed by the Regulation 28 Working Group, comprising Regional Medical Directors, and other clinical and quality colleagues from across the regions. This ensures that key learnings and insights around events, such as the sad death of Joel, are shared across the NHS at both a national and regional level and helps us to pay close attention to any emerging trends that may require further review and action.\", \"I write in response to the Regulation 28 Prevention of Future Deaths report issued on 13 November 2024 to the South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SECAmb) following the inquest into the sad death of Mr Colk.\\n\\nI was very sorry to learn of the death of Mr Colk and I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.\\n\\nI note the other relevant organisations named in this PFD report:\\n\\nNHS England & NHS Improvement\\n\\nWith regard your first matter of concern:\\n\\n“The Court heard that when a call is made to 999 that the call is categorised using NHS Pathways and that all overdoses would be in the same classification resulting in the same disposition and response category. The system does not differentiate between types of, severity of or the drugs/chemicals reported as being the cause of the overdose. The system also does not differentiate call classification taking into account the amount reported as ingested, the timing of ingestion or the patient's weight. The Court heard that all of these factors can impact on the time in which care needs to be rendered to prevent death. The example given to the Court was that someone who had taken a relatively small paracetamol that would be unlikely to cause harm would, using Pathways, have the same resultant disposition as someone who had ingested a significant amount of a known lethal chemical.\\n\\nThe Court heard that in the case of [redacted] ingestion that treatment is only effective if medications are administered before the patient suffers a cardiac arrest. This likely will occur incredibly rapidly and is a known effect of the chemical. The Pathways system does not reflect the time sensitive nature for an effective response when it is known that sodium nitrite has been ingested and would not create a higher disposition requiring more urgent attendance than category 3.”\\n\\nThe NHS Pathways Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is a triage product that is used to support call handlers (known as Emergency Medical Advisors within SECAmb). The product is owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and is manufactured and managed by the Transformation Directorate of NHS England.\\n\\nNHS Pathways as a product has independent oversight by the National Clinical Assurance Group (NCAG), which in turn is hosted by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC). Robust processes exist nationally to provide scrutiny of the NHS Pathways clinical content, which is built around a clinical hierarchy, meaning that life-threatening symptoms are assessed at the start of the call to trigger ambulance responses.\\n\\nIt is widely acknowledged that overdoses, both intentional or accidental, are challenging to assess remotely, with a vast array of different substances being presented to urgent and emergency care services resulting in a significant variance of potential toxidromes.\\n\\nThis is further challenged in the absence of signs and symptoms which would be indicative of an immediate threat to life; symptoms indicating a compromise of airway, breathing or circulation do receive Category 1 or Category 2 ambulance dispositions within overdose presentations.\\n\\nWhen an absence of immediately life-threatening symptoms such as the above is being presented in intentional overdose, the lowest ambulance disposition that can be reached is a Category 3 emergency ambulance outcome. However this Category 3 outcome is supported by additional measures specific to overdose that have been in place within SECAmb since July 2019 and further amendments to local procedures following the publication of a operational guidance by NHS England and the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) entitled, “Category 3 – 999 Overdose and Suicidal Ideation Calls; Initial Assessment of Lethality / Toxicity Principles Document” in April 2021, subsequently being further updated in November 2023.\\n\\nSECAmb has procedures and processes in place to fully follow the principles as set out, which include:\\n\\nWhere an overdose is declared, further clinical intervention should take place within 30 minutes, or the case must be automatically upgraded if this does not occur within 40 minutes.\\n\\nIt is good practice for TOXBASE® (clinical toxicology database of the UK National Poisons Information Service) to be viewed for each overdose / accidental ingestion incident, despite the familiarity of the reviewing clinician with that particular toxicity profile, which includes [redacted]. It is noted that management practices often change in relation to specific toxins, therefore guidance around the use of TOXBASE® was issued instead. Utilising TOXBASE® similarly ensures that the relevant current guidance is accessed when managing emerging and novel substance ingestion enabling the clinician to assess risk on an individual case basis.\\n\\nThe initial clinical review should also consider any ongoing suicidal ideation with a specific plan / means.\\n\\nAlthough SECAmb followed the 999 Overdose and suicidal ideation calls – initial assessment of lethality / toxicity principles with the call being automatically upgraded to a Category 2 response as a clinical review did not take place within 40 minutes, we do recognise that in this case Mr Colk volunteered the information to the 999 call handler that he had taken [redacted]. Recent reports cited within a PFD response provided by the National Ambulance Resilience Unit (NARU) indicate 1 case of [redacted] being ingested for every 0.5 million 999 calls in UK ambulance services, so whilst the incidence of [redacted] poisoning is increasing, it is still a very rare occurrence (Courts and Tribunals Judiciary - Response from NARU, 2024).\\n\\nAs a Trust, we would like to use this case alongside others to support a workstream in early development that we are undertaking, regarding the potential for the use of new and emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence to ‘ambiently listen’ to 999 calls. The aim is to enhance patient safety and reduce human cognitive burden, potentially highlighting certain calls to clinicians that have rare or unique risks earlier. We are in the early stages of understanding this technology and undertaking this work alongside four other NHS Ambulance Trusts as part of the Southern Ambulance Collaborative, and although we envisage if successful this having wider benefits to a range of presentations that 999 ambulance calls present, we have included [redacted] overdose as an example within the proposed case for change.\\n\\nWith regard your second matter of concern:\\n\\n“The Court was also told that clinicians do not carry on any Ambulances within South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust Methylene Blue which is the antidote to [redacted] ingestion as this is not within national guidance. I heard that in some areas there are ongoing trials for some areas that this is on board vehicles within the HART (Hazardous Area Response Team). Therefore in this area the treatment is only available when a patient reaches an acute hospital with an A&E department and the evidence was that often patients enter cardiac arrest before this occurs.”\\n\\nGovernance and Decision-Making\\n\\nSECAmb employs a rigorous and comprehensive governance framework to determine which medications are carried by its clinicians. Our Medicines Governance Group (MGG)—chaired by the Chief Pharmacist and comprising senior clinicians, operational managers, academic representatives, public members, and subject matter experts—oversees all medication-related decisions. Any proposal to add or amend a medicine within our formulary requires a robust New Drug Application (NDA) and consideration of clinical evidence, operational feasibility, financial sustainability, and alignment with national best practice.\\n\\nChallenges in Pre-Hospital Diagnosis and Treatment\\n\\n[Redacted] poisoning causes methaemoglobinaemia, which can only be reliably diagnosed using specialised diagnostic equipment (e.g., Masimo Rainbow SET sensors). In a pre-hospital context, the accurate identification of sodium nitrite ingestion is complicated by non-specific presentations and the unlikelihood of having immediate access to this specialist equipment on every frontline vehicle. Consequently, the administration of methylene blue in the pre-hospital setting poses significant diagnostic and logistical challenges, especially given the low incidence of confirmed sodium nitrite poisonings.\\n\\nAvailability and Cost Implications\\n\\nMethylene blue is supplied in 50 mg vials in the UK, with treatment for methaemoglobinaemia potentially requiring several vials per patient, depending on body weight. Equipping the entire SECAmb fleet of over 300 clinical vehicles with sufficient stock—much of which may expire before use—would place significant demands on the service in terms of finance, logistics and workforce training. Additional resource investment would also be necessary for specialised diagnostic equipment, further complicating routine operations.\\n\\nSpecialist Resource Considerations\\n\\nAlthough certain regions are trialling the use of Hazardous Area Response Teams (HART) to carry methylene blue, these teams are designed for high-risk environments. SECAmb’s HART operates from two bases (Ashford and Crawley), but their geographic reach and the unpredictable nature of [redacted] poisonings do not guarantee they would always be the initial or timely responders to these cases. In many instances, rapid transfer to hospital—where comprehensive evaluation and definitive treatment (such as intubation, ventilation, inotropic support, or exchange transfusion) can be provided—remains the most pragmatic approach.\\n\\nCardiac Arrest Considerations\\n\\nCritically, for those patients who have already sustained a cardiac arrest by the time ambulance clinicians arrive, the likelihood of restoring spontaneous circulation using methylene blue is indicated to be low. Advanced cardiac life support measures—including prompt hospital transfer for definitive care—are therefore prioritised, as per current clinical best practice.\\n\\nOngoing National Discussions\\n\\nSECAmb is aware that discussions are ongoing nationally regarding the role of methylene blue for sodium nitrite poisoning. We remain actively engaged with NHS ambulance services and will carefully review any future recommendations that emerge, particularly if published via JRCALC or other authoritative bodies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, SECAmb remains committed to delivering the highest standard of pre-hospital care within the framework of evidence-based clinical practice. We continuously review our medication formulary in line with emerging guidance and new evidence. At present, and in accordance with current national recommendations, equipping all front-line ambulances with methylene blue and specialist diagnostic tools is neither clinically feasible nor cost-effective. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor evolving guidance and, where appropriate, modify our protocols to maintain patient safety and optimise outcomes.\"]), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/andrew-howat-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0623', recipients=['Kingkabs Wheatsheaf Garage'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern=\"The taxi driver indicated a willingness to leave passengers in unsafe locations despite training, suggesting a risk that drivers may not act in passengers' best interests in similar circumstances.\"), ConcernItem(concern='Kingkabs did not contact the police in the incident as per their usual practice, indicating a failure to follow established protocols in situations involving passenger safety.'), ConcernItem(concern='There was no evidence or documentation to confirm that Kingkabs staff were being trained on the protocol to contact the police in such circumstances, raising concerns about the adequacy of staff training and adherence to safety procedures.')]), responses=['Thank you for your Regulation 28 Prevention of Deaths report dated 13th November 2024 regarding the tragic death of Andrew Howat.

WSFT are keen to assure the family and HM Coroner that the concerns raised about Erin’s care have been listened to and reflected upon. Whilst the inquest concluded on 31 May 2024, WSFT have been proactive in continuing improvement work in respect of the access to Mental Health Services since that time and specific details of that work, and the further work planned, is set out below.\\n\\nYour Report specifically raises concerns over the failure to ensure that the Emergency Department (ED) followed NICE Guidance (NG225) dated 7 September 2022 regarding the management and assessment of patients presenting with signs of self-harm, and that you received evidence during the course of the Inquest that neither the NICE Guidance, nor the SNEE/SCC Policy (Suffolk and North East Essex Health & Social Care Protocol for the Support of Children and Young People in Crisis) were applied in relation to the care and treatment extended to Erin.\\n\\nPlease find below details of the action taken to date to address this concern, as well as some additional information regarding how the referral process works:\\n\\n1. The WSFT Mental Health Liaison Team work closely with all clinical staff across the hospital. For those patients who attend ED with a mental health need, the aim is for the MHLT to review the patient within one hour. For those patients already admitted to the wards, they are seen within 24 hours.\\n\\nWSFT’s policy: Mental Health – supporting patients with their mental health (PP459) specifically highlights that:\\n\\n“All patients who attend the hospital who have self-harmed should be offered to be seen by the MHLT as per Nice Guideline (NG225) Self Harm: assessment, management and preventing recurrence.\\n\\nThe service provides mental health assessment and support for service users who have attended hospital to access mental health services or those with both physical and mental health difficulties. This is not a Mental Health Act Assessment (see section Care under the Mental Health Act (1983)). The team will meet with patients to explore their mental state and will collaboratively create a care and risk management plan that helps to improve their mental health. This information will be recorded on E- Care.\\n\\nThe service is available 365 days per year, 24/7 and is age inclusive.\\n\\nReferrals can be made to the Mental Health Liaison Team via E-Care or by telephoning 01284 713386/713391.”\\n\\nWe hope this reassures HM Coroner that WSFT staff are aware of the NICE guidance and the SNEE/SCC policy and continue to apply it regularly. For added reassurance, a review of WSFT data regarding referrals of patients aged under 18 accessing mental health services at WSFT confirms the following:\\n\\nYear | ED Referral | Ward Referral | Total\\n2023 | 313 | 64 | 377\\n2024* | 287 | 85 | 372\\n*YTD\\n\\nSadly, what this data shows is that every day a patient under 18 is referred by ED or the ward to the MHLT for specialist input and support. Whilst terribly sad, this does show that the referral system is working and WSFT staff do have a low threshold for making referrals so that specialist input from the MHLT can be provided.\\n\\n2. The reason a MHLT referral was not made in Erin’s case was because of an error of clinical judgment. Staff believed that Erin’s case was one of an accidental not an intentional overdose. Therefore, they believed a MHLT referral was not needed. Hindsight confirms that was incorrect and our work has been focused on helping staff make the right clinical decisions first time in future. That work, led by the Mental Health team and ED Matrons has consisted of the following steps: -\\n\\na. additional reminders sent to the whole team about having a low threshold for referrals to MHLT.\\n\\nb. Additional training – this is targeted at specific staff groups for maximum effect:\\n\\nAdult ED Nurses have bespoke mandatory MHLT training package run by the MHLT.\\n\\nJunior doctors have induction training every 4 months as new cohorts join us and the Head of Mental Health will lead on that training moving forwards. The focus on the training is for staff to feel encouraged and supported to have a low threshold for suspecting a mental health condition/illness and for making a referral.\\n\\nPaediatric ED Nurses have been provided with additional training to make sure staff know when an automatic referral to the MHLT has been made and how to use the new triage form (discussed below). This is in addition to the mental health training that is part of the new induction training for all new ED nurses. The focus of the training is on the team working together and nurses are encouraged to ask doctors to consider making a referral if they have any suspicions. The above data confirms this is happening.\\n\\n3. To further support staff to make the right decisions in future, WSFT’s policy: Mental Health – supporting patients with their mental health (PP459) has been updated in August 2024. A new section 5.3 has specifically been added, focussing on how the policy applies to emergency admissions, an extract is below:\\n\\n“5.3. Emergency Admissions\\nPatients admitted through ED will be triaged using the Manchester Triage Tool. If the patient presents following for example, overdosing and self-harm this will then trigger a bespoke/extended patient safety checklist which provides a closer assessment of the patient’s mental health risk state. Part 1 of the Mental Health Risk Assessment should also be completed which is triggered on E care.\\n\\nIf the patients are assessed as vulnerable or at high risk to self or others the “Observation of patients: One to one “Clinical guideline must be followed, to ensure that their safety and safety others is met. Observations will be recorded on the observation form (Appendix 1).\\n\\nWhilst being cared for in ED staff must ensure that the patient isn’t placed in a high-risk ligature area (as per ligature assessment) and complete the environment safety checklist (Appendix 2).\\n\\nWaiting can be difficult for anyone who is ill or in pain, the patient may find the waiting extremely difficult, and this can lead to additional problems, for example, ‘behaviours which may challenge’. ED staff should consider offering a quieter waiting area with clear information to the patient and their family/carer if they are with them.\\n\\nA safe room is available to be used by the MHLT for assessing the patient. This meets the PLAN standards:\\n- Patients without a medical need will be referred directly to the MHLT.\\n- Patients with a medical need will be referred to the MHLT once assessed as being medically fit enough for their mental health to be assessed. The MHLT will assess the patient within one hour.”\\n\\n4. Further work following a review of Erin’s case by the ED team has resulted in the triage process discussed in point 3 being extended to patients under 18. The Manchester Triage system used for suspected mental health conditions was originally designed for adult patients and has been working successfully for some time. However, that has been adapted and extended for use in under 18’s care. Briefly there are 5 categories within the triage process that trigger automatically at the point of triage for MHLT review/referral. These include patient’s that present with an overdose. This leads to an additional assessment by the triage nurse at that time and, once completed, that sends an alert to the MHLT for them to complete part 2 of the referral. Examples of the new process and subsequent risk assessments are included in Appendix 1. The categories are highlighted red in the boxes on the form. This process has been developed over the summer and has now been included on the electronic patient record system – Ecare. It went live two weeks ago.\\n\\n5. Whilst safety netting did work in Erin’s case, as the safeguarding team reviewed her case the following day and made contact with the GP so that further assistance could be provided, during the reviews after her sad death, we have identified the opportunity to improve the safeguarding process further. There is now a triage for safeguarding which allows them to prioritise patients attending with a mental health condition which are graded as red so that they are reviewed as a priority.\\n\\n6. All under 18’s attending ED also have their discharge letter sent to the GP and school nurse, or if under 5 the Health Visitor, automatically in every case.\\n\\nPatient Safety Review & Learning\\n\\nWSFT also undertook a Patient Safety Review, which was completed on 24 October 2023. This proved the catalyst for further review and discussion and helped to bring together a number of projects and workstreams, discussed and highlighted above. Policies have been reviewed, training refined and extended, triage forms changed, and additional safety netting put into place The report was also shared with external partners and incorporated into their wider review.\\n\\nFuture Action and Proposed timetable for implementation\\n\\nAs part of the constant evolution of Mental Health Services in acute care, the Mental Health team, led by Natalie Bailey (Head of Mental Health at WSFT), confirms that the children and young people in crises protocol is currently under review by SNEE (Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board). Currently there is a consultation exercise underway with all key stakeholders, including WSFT, Norfolk and Suffolk Mental Health trust, parents, service users, ESNEFT and the ICB. This consultation and review will be completed next year and a working group will be established thereafter at WSFT to implement any changes.\\n\\nIn order to minimise harm and prevent occurrences like this happening in future, WSFT will continue to work with all system partners, both to monitor and review performance as we look for new ways to address the difficulties treating this cohort of patients.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/lisa-gale-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0619', recipients=['Royal College of Pathologists', 'Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists', 'Chief Midwife', 'Southwest Regional Midwife', 'University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern=\"Laboratory staff did not urgently communicate grossly elevated liver function test results to clinical staff because the Royal College of Pathologists' guidelines only mandate urgent reporting above certain thresholds not adjusted for pregnancy.\"), ConcernItem(concern=\"The Royal College of Pathologists' guidelines for urgent reporting of liver function tests do not account for pregnancy-specific conditions like Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy, which can be fatal at lower abnormal levels.\"), ConcernItem(concern='The lack of pregnancy-specific urgent reporting thresholds for liver function tests led to a delay in diagnosing Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy and initiating appropriate treatment.')]), responses=[\"Thank you for your Regulation 28 Report to Prevent Future deaths following the inquest into the death of Lisa Gale dated 12 November 2024.\\n\\nThis loss is a devastating tragedy for the immediate and the wider family, and the healthcare professionals involved. We would like to begin by extending our deepest and heartfelt condolences to Lisa’s family for their profound loss.\\n\\nThis response has been developed following input from members of the RCOG Patient Safety Committee and Senior Officers of the College.\\n\\nWe recognise and respect the narrative conclusion from the inquest that Lisa died of natural causes subsequent to developing a rare but serious condition, Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP).\\n\\nWe also recognise the matters of concern as outlined in your letter as follows, 1. Blood was taken for liver function test (LFTs) on admission before her condition was diagnosed. 2. Lisa’s LFT’s were grossly elevated (normal range in brackets) a. ALT 612 (10-50) b. Bilirubin 122 (<21) c. Creatinine 168 (45-84) 3. This was due to a potentially fatal condition AFLP from which she subsequently died. 4. Despite being grossly elevated, the results once obtained in the laboratory were not phoned through by the laboratory staff to the clinical staff. 5. This was because the Royal College of Pathologists guidelines for urgent reporting only provides for the same levels above 750 ALT, 300 for bilirubin and 354 for creatinine and does not provide for different reporting levels for those taken in pregnant women.\\n\\n6. This is despite pregnancy specific conditions such as AFLP being potentially fatal at much lower levels of abnormal LFTs that those set currently by the Royal College of Pathologists. 7. As a result there was a delay in diagnosing her ALFP and starting appropriate treatment.\\n\\nFollowing review of the Regulation 28 Report it’s recognised that there are key themes identified here which the College has provided clarity on over the past few years through its various initiatives. These include development of clinical guidance and good practice papers recommending appropriate escalation of clinical concerns, multidisciplinary working and seeking timely advice from clinical experts especially in case of rare medical conditions. Lisa had developed a complication of pregnancy that is very rare. In such situations, it is essential that the wider multidisciplinary team including obstetric physicians, anaesthetists and intensivists are involved in care provision, especially when there are severely abnormal test results and/or clinical deterioration.\\n\\nThis case highlights the delay in diagnosis of the severity of condition, resulting from the laboratory not using pregnancy specific levels of liver enzymes for reporting of abnormal results. The guidelines from the Royal College of Pathologists ‘The communication of critical and unexpected pathology results’ (2017) recognises that there are variation in results phoned and suggests that this should be set by local need. The RCOG will review the response from the Royal College of Pathologists following this Regulation 28 Report and ensure that this is appropriately communicated with its members and included within relevant clinical guidance.\\n\\nThe RCOG however, recognises that there is also an obligation for clinical teams requesting investigations to review the results in a timely manner, depending on the severity of the clinical condition. In the current digital era, laboratory results are available on clinical systems and these should be reviewed by staff caring for the woman. Guidance on the clinician responsibilities is outlined in the GMC Good Clinical Practice 2009, NMC Code of Conduct 2008 and the BMA Acting upon electronic test results (updated in June 2024). Individual trusts/organisations will have specific guidelines applicable to their electronic patient records and it is expected that these, in line with GMC and BMA guidance, would outline the responsibilities of the clinical staff and potential time scales expected. The RCOG feel that this responsibility lies at the organisational level and should be communicated to the NHS-England & NHS in the devolved nations.\\n\\nThere is no RCOG guidance on the diagnosis and management of AFL in pregnancy. This is due to the rarity of the condition and the requirement for early intervention by specialist teams should the condition be suspected. The College does provide an online learning resource outlining the key clinical features, investigations, differential diagnosis, and management options. This resource can be found at: Acute fatty liver of pregnancy Key elements of care relate to the early diagnosis and escalation to the multidisciplinary team which includes: haematologists, hepatologists, anaesthetists, intensivists and the local or regional liver units.\\n\\nThe RCOG emphasised the importance of escalation as a key priority in provision of safe care within its Each Baby Counts and the Avoiding Brain Injury in Childbirth Programmes. There are a number of resources available through the College to support Trusts in a Quality Improvement approach to improve escalation in clinical situations.\\n\\nWe are aware that you have written to the Royal College of Pathologists, and we would suggest that their guidance and the thresholds contained within 'The communication of critical and unexpected pathology results' is reviewed and amended to take account of the needs of pregnant women.\\n\\nThe College’s commitment firmly lies in improving maternity safety. This encompasses elevating care standards through clinical guidance and multidisciplinary training. The College strongly advocates the importance of the Trust’s guidelines being aligned with national guidelines.\\n\\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. I hope this is a helpful response to this matter.\", 'Thank you for your Report to Prevent Future Deaths (hereafter “Report”) dated 12 November 2024 concerning the death of Lisa Gale on 5 April 2023, addressed to NHS England’s Chief Midwife. I am responding on behalf of the organisation in my capacity as National Medical Director but would like to assure you that NHS England’s Chief Midwifery Officer has also reviewed your Report and been sighted on this response.\\n\\nIn advance of responding to the specific concerns raised in your Report, I would like to express my deep condolences to Lisa’s family and loved ones. NHS England are keen to assure the family and the Coroner that the concerns raised about Lisa’s care have been listened to and reflected upon.\\n\\nYour Report raised concerns over the Royal College of Pathologists’ guidelines for urgent reporting of liver function tests (LFTs) undertaken on pregnant women, despite pregnancy specific conditions such as Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) being potentially fatal at much lower levels of abnormal LFTs. Specialist Maternity, Obstetrics & Midwifery colleagues at NHS England have been consulted on my response to the Coroner.\\n\\nNHS England has led the establishment of Maternal Medicine Networks (MMNs) across England, so that all women can receive specialist advice and care for the management of chronic and acute medical problems before, during and after pregnancy. All 14 Networks have been operational for two years as of December 2024.\\n\\nThe National Service Specification for Maternal Medicine Networks, published in October 2021, describes the care pathways and clinical dependencies of MMNs and maternal medicine centres (MMCs). Every Network is responsible for agreeing shared protocols on the management and escalation of medical problems that pre-exist or arise in pregnancy and in the puerperium (6 week postpartum period). Every Network has at least one MMC, which provides advice or care for the highest risk cases, along with advice, training and education for local units across the Network. Where specialist advice or care has been provided at an MMC, this will continue for as long as deemed medically necessary.\\n\\nDiagnosis of rare conditions such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy can be challenging due to the differences in physiology for pregnant and non-pregnant women. Whilst maternal medicine networks would be expected to drive up the quality of care for women with acute medical conditions in pregnancy, such as acute fatty liver, and raise awareness around presentation, the problem identified was a delay in diagnosis owing to an abnormal result in a pregnant woman not being recognised as such and so not urgently reported. NHS England would therefore support the revision of the Royal College of Pathologists’ guidelines to incorporate different urgent reporting levels for results of tests taken during pregnancy, and we note that the Coroner has also addressed your Report to the College.\\n\\nI would also like to provide further assurances on the national NHS England work taking place around the Reports to Prevent Future Deaths. All reports received are discussed by the Regulation 28 Working Group, comprising Regional Medical Directors, and other clinical and quality colleagues from across the regions. This ensures that key learnings and insights around events, such as the sad death of Lisa, are shared across the NHS at both a national and regional level and helps us to pay close attention to any emerging trends that may require further review and action.', 'With regards to the RCPath document on The Communication of Critical and Unexpected Pathology results, this document is published as ‘advice to pathologists’ and is offered as a basis on which pathologists can construct their own local guidelines after discussion with relevant stakeholders. It is clearly stated that it is vital that this document is seen as guidance for pathology providers to set their own criteria on how, when, and why particular laboratory results are required to be communicated to clinical professionals in an expedited manner. Whilst recommendations are made within the Appendix on cut offs which can be used, it is recommended that individual cut offs are agreed locally with clinicians, and this could be for a variety of clinical conditions with might include pregnancy. The need to agree local cut offs with clinicians will be emphasised in the next revision of this document.', 'I am writing in response to the Regulation 28 Report to Prevent Future Deaths dated 12 November 2024. I would like to begin by extending my deepest condolences to the family of Ms Gale. I hope that my response provides both you, and Ms Gale’s family, with assurance that the Trust has taken this further opportunity to carefully consider any actions we can take which may improve patient care in the future.\\n\\nIn order to respond to the Matters of Concern set out in your report, I have sought the assistance of Clinical Chair for Diagnostic and Therapies, Consultant Chemical Pathologist, Chief Medical Officer, and Consultant Obstetrician who was present throughout the inquest.\\n\\nWe have carefully considered the issue of setting a lower threshold for the urgent reporting reference range for Liver Function Tests (LFTs) in pregnant women. On reflection, we consider that one hospital Trust changing the reference range in isolation will not address the broader issue which has the potential to affect all pregnant women at a national level. UHBW is a tertiary level referral hospital, treating women from across the South-West region. We are concerned that developing guidance in respect of reference ranges for LFTs in pregnant women in UHBW in isolation, could potentially create more risk to patients rather than reduce it, as hospitals within the region, and across the country, would be working to different guidance.\\n\\nTo safely implement any recommended changes to reference ranges for LFTs in pregnancy we would ordinarily consider national guidance from the Royal Colleges. We have therefore written to both the Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal College of Obstetricians asking them to consider your report and the development of national guidance on this important issue. Given our knowledge of this case, we are happy to work alongside the Royal Colleges in the development of guidance.\\n\\nThe Royal College of Pathologists have advised that their guideline ‘The Communication of Critical and Unexpected Pathology Results’ is published as advice to pathologists and is offered as a basis on which pathologists can construct their own local guidelines after discussion with relevant stakeholders. The Royal College of Pathologists recommend that individual cut offs are agreed locally with clinicians, and this could be for a variety of clinical conditions with might include pregnancy.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, we are awaiting the response from the Royal College of Obstetricians. In the meantime, we have also raised the issue with the regional obstetric lead, who we understand is liaising with the national obstetric lead on this issue.\\n\\nOnce national guidance has become available regarding a recommended reference range for urgent reporting of LFTs in pregnancy, UHBW will set up a task and finish group, led by Dr Bennett, Dr Willis, and Dr Liebling to implement these across the Trust in a safe and robust manner.\\n\\nIn the event of no national guidance, UHBW would look to change our reference range locally with guidance from our obstetric and laboratory teams.\\n\\nWe hope that the above response provides you, and Ms Gale’s family, with assurance that the Trust has carefully considered your report and identified the safest way of proceeding. We continually challenge ourselves to consider any further action we can take to strengthen patient safety across our hospitals, whilst recognising that some aspects of patient safety are best raised at a national level.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/john-doyle-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0618', recipients=['NHS England', 'The Chief Executive Officer of University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust', 'The Chief Executive Officer of George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust', 'UK Kidney Association', 'British Transplant Society', 'Renal Association'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='Non-specialist medical staff may have varied understanding of the appropriate contacts and timing for engaging with specialist renal hospitals.'), ConcernItem(concern='The specific patient information that non-specialist staff should provide to specialist renal hospitals may not always be clearly defined.'), ConcernItem(concern='Non-specialist staff may experience varying levels of awareness or accessibility to guidelines and protocols for treating kidney transplant patients, potentially leading to misunderstanding the significance and urgency of specialist recommendations.'), ConcernItem(concern='There may be inconsistency across non-specialist and renal hospitals in understanding who is responsible for initiating patient transfers.'), ConcernItem(concern='Considerations regarding whether patients should remain in non-specialist areas or be transferred may differ, affecting consistency in care approaches.'), ConcernItem(concern='Variation exists in how specialist renal hospitals engage with non-specialist hospitals, and there is no clear guidance on effective collaboration to ensure consistent, high-quality care for kidney transplant patients.')]), responses=['As reported on the day of the inquest (8th November 2024) the University Hospitals of Coventry & Warwickshire (UHCW) were compiling guidelines to assist the George Eliot Hospital (GEH) should the Trust have an inpatient with similar health conditions in the future as there is no renal specialist service at the GEH. The Trust has now received management guidelines from the Renal Team at UHCW and below is a table showing what actions the Trust has taken to embed the information received. Following the inquest on 8 November 2024, our Consultant Governance Lead for the Medicine Directorate has continued to liaise with the Consultant Renal Specialist at UHCW to develop robust joint clinical guidelines. GEH will take every case individually as they present and will also contact the appropriate Trust where the patient is receiving their renal care. As well as guidelines from UHCW a laminated quick reference guide has been produced which contains the emergency contact numbers for renal services at UHCW. This will be displayed across the Trust. Patients who are pregnant with on-going renal conditions/transplant would be transferred to UHCW as part of the Maternal Medicine Pathway. The guidelines (enclosure 1) illustrate the sample collection requirements, together with what to do if the results are positive and the telephone numbers to be used. Clinical staff will liaise at the earliest with the specialist centre as results dictate. This is documented on the enclosed guideline. The guidelines provided by UHCW will be available on the intranet once the Trust’s ratification process has been followed. Guidelines have already been shared with all Directorates to make sure that the relevant clinical staff are aware of the guidelines. Consultant to consultant clinical conversations will take place if there is a requirement to transfer the patient to the renal centre. There is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) in place for a renal specialist from UHCW to visit renal patients being cared for a GEH, twice a week. This patient familiarisation will assist in the timely transfer process should the patient need to be relocated to the specialist centre. There is a consultant to consultant referral process in place where decisions are made on the location based on the patients clinical need. The guidelines from UHCW are very clear on when they should be invoked and the quick reference guides will make it easier for GEH staff.', 'Further to your e-mail dated the 9 January 2025, I am writing to confirm that the Trust has considered the response from UK Kidney Association (UKKA) and the British Transplantation Society (BTS) and we believe that the Trust had covered everything in our original response, with 2 exceptions.\\n\\n1. The first recommendation is ensuring switchboard have a master copy of local specialist centre contact details and the Trust can confirm that this action has been taken.\\n3. This recommendation is about notifying UKKA of all patients with chronic kidney stage 5 (CDK G5) or who are receiving dialysis treatment or who have a kidney transplant. University Hospitals of Coventry & Warwickshire update UKKA as the specialist centre for this specialty.\\n\\nThe three action points at the end of the letter are for UKKA and BTS to undertake, however, I confirm that the Trust has received and acknowledged them.', 'Thank you for your email of 12 November 2024 enclosing a Regulation 28 Report to Prevent Future Deaths which is addressed to a number of organisations which include University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (UHCW) following the inquest into the death of Mr Doyle.\\n\\nAs you are aware from the evidence of the medical witnesses at the inquest on 8 November 2024, the renal team at UHCW have been developing guidelines to assist George Eliot Hospital (GEH), a non-renal specialist hospital, in the management of acutely unwell kidney transplant renal inpatients. We are pleased to report that these guidelines have been finalised and agreed between the Trusts and we enclose a copy.\\n\\nThese guidelines have been shared and cascaded within the respective clinical teams which includes discussion as the Trust\\'s Renal Quality Improvement and Patient Safety meeting (QIPS). Once ratified through the usual governance processes these guidelines will be placed on the Trust\\'s intranet to be accessible to all staff.\\n\\nIn addition, both Trusts have agreed a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which means that a member of UHCW\\'s renal team will attend GEH and review their renal inpatients on GEH request up to twice a week.\\n\\nOne of our senior Transplant Nephrologists has liaised with UK Kidney Association who are in agreement with the measures taken by UHCW and GEH in response to this report.\\n\\nWe believe these combined measures address the 6 concerns set out in your Report and will undoubtedly improve patient care and lead to better collaborative working.\\n\\nTaking the concerns that you have raised in turn we respond as follows:\\n\\nConcern 1: Contacting Specialist Centres\\n\\nThe SLA between the Trusts enables GEH to contact the UHCW renal team and request an on-site attendance. This will mean that a UHCW nephrologist will attend to review renal patients where their input is required up to twice a week.\\n\\nIn addition, the current processes for GEH to contact specialist have been outlined in the guidelines, including contacting the renal team and also the virology team.\\n\\nConcern 2: Information Sharing with Specialist Centres\\n\\nThe SLA and guideline set up a clear framework to ensure good communication between the Trusts including timely investigation and treatment. Additionally, processes to document communication between renal department and other hospitals, \"referapatient.org\" is being considered.\\n\\nConcern 3: Accessibility to Renal Care Guidelines\\n\\nThe guidelines have been agreed with the relevant departments and shared with GEH. Both UHCW and GEH have worked closely to ensure the guidelines communicate the relevant information in an easily understandable manner, whilst ensuring the urgency is conveyed. Guidelines have been cascaded within the respective clinical teams and will be placed on the UHCW intranet once they have been through the governance process for ratification.\\n\\nConcern 4: Transfer Responsibility\\n\\nThe SLA which provides that a renal specialist will attend GEH on request should help identify those patients requiring urgent transfer. UHCW will be responsible to accept all renal patients admitted to GEH, regardless of their parent hospital. In addition, the internal processes to highlight which patients need urgent transfer have been changed (we now have a daily huddle at 11.30am with the UHCW Medicine Operational team where a renal doctor is present, so that interhospital transfers can be highlighted and appropriately prioritised).\\n\\nConcern 5: Decision-Making for Patient Location\\n\\nThe SLA will support decision-making for patient location by ensuring face to face communication between senior medical staff from UHCW and GEH. We anticipate that the guideline will also support this, in that investigations and results will be more timely available and reviewed.\\n\\nConcern 6: Coordination Between Specialist and Non-Specialist Hospitals\\n\\nIt is usually the case that a non-specialist hospital will contact the parent specialist hospital where that particular patient has been having their routine renal care. However, following this Regulation 28, UHCW will now be the primary specialist transfer centre for all renal patients admitted to GEH regardless of their parent specialist unit. The agreed shared guidelines and SLA will ensure closer working and improved patient care.', 'Thank you for your email of 9 January 2025. In response to the additional points raised by the UK Kidney Association (UKKA) and the British Transplantation Society (BTS) in their letter dated 21 December 2024, we comment as below:\\n\\nContacting off-site specialists and sharing information\\n\\nWe recommend that all hospital switchboards, Emergency Departments and relevant personnel have a master copy of local specialist centre contact details so any query at any time can be appropriately directed.\\n\\nWhilst this is a question that is best answered by our local non specialist hospitals, we are aware that both South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust and George Eliot Hospital switchboards and their Emergency Departments have local specialist centre contact details.\\n\\nWe recommend that all staff are advised of internal escalation routes. Relevant clinical colleagues should be aware of internal escalation routes to clarify whether off-site specialist input is required. We would expect this to be achieved by asking the Consultant responsible for the patient’s care or their deputy.\\n\\nWe confirm that staff at UHCW are aware of internal escalation routes. The escalation of concerns is via the renal registrar and renal consultant. We confirm that UHCW has shared and agreed with George Eliot Hospitals the indications for referral to us as a specialist unit, and the routes for referral.\\n\\nWe advise that electronic information sharing in real-time should be the gold standard for information sharing. In the case of kidney patients, we would expect to be informed about all patients admitted for care in another hospital or elsewhere in our own hospital who have chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD G5) or who are receiving dialysis treatment or who have a kidney transplant.\\n\\nThere is an established and effective process for referring patients who are receiving dialysis to their parent unit. UHCW has Service Level Agreements with George Eliot Hospital and with South Warwickshire Foundation Trust that UHCW will provide onsite Renal Consultant Specialist inpatient review at GEH and SWFT upon request up to twice a week. Additionally, UHCW has worked with UK Kidney Association and agreed to be the primary specialist transfer centre for all renal transplant patients admitted from referring hospitals regardless of their parent specialist unit.\\n\\nElectronic patient sharing of blood test results in real-time exists for patients who are already known to UHCW Renal Department, whether admitted to GEH or SWFT. In addition, “referapatient.org” is being considered as a means of recording communication between referring centres and UHCW in real time.\\n\\nWe advise that Trusts review their processes to ensure that CMV results are available in a timely fashion. This involves considering the transport and turnaround of samples with prompt reporting in specialist virology laboratories as well as how to ensure that blood is taken in the correct blood tubes.\\n\\nFollowing the sad death of Mr Doyle, UHCW Renal and Virology teams have reviewed processes. Guidelines have been developed which describe: the correct blood tubes, how to ensure urgent turnaround, who to contact, when, and how to escalate to These have been shared with GEH. Turnaround times for all pathology labs are published in CWPS Handbook V16 May 2024.pdf.\\n\\nAccessibility to Renal Care Guidelines\\n\\nAs access to Guidelines could lead to a misunderstanding of the significance and urgency of required actions; the critical action in this case would be to contact the Specialist Centre\\n\\nWe agree with the UKKA and Royal College response.\\n\\nWhilst we acknowledge that being well-informed can help with communication and care delivery, in this case we would advise that care be delivered by a Specialist who should not necessarily need to refer to the Guidelines.\\n\\nWe agree the UKKA and Royal College response. In addition to our established process of contacting the specialist team by phone, reinstating the SLAs ensures that referring centres can ask for specialist consultant review onsite. Both communications support early and appropriate treatment and transfer if needed.\\n\\nTransfer of responsibility, care coordination and decision-making for patient location\\n\\nWe recommend that when a Specialist Team is managing the care of a particular condition at a distance or on-site, they assume responsibility for recommending the best location for care delivery. This may require careful negotiation in cases where multiple conditions are being managed.\\n\\nWe accept the responsibility for recommending best location for all patients referred to Renal Services. Based on the clinical requirements patients could be transferred to UHCW or reviewed by the UHCW renal consultant at the local hospital and transferred over later if necessary.\\n\\nWe recommend that the responsible Specialist Team is from the local specialist renal centre rather than the renal centre usually caring for the patient. If necessary, local specialists can liaise directly with the relevant renal centre.\\n\\nIt is usually the case that a non-specialist hospital will contact the parent specialist hospital where that patient has been receiving their routine renal care. However, as a result of this Regulation 28, UHCW will now be the primary specialist transfer centre for all renal patients admitted to peripheral hospitals regardless of their parent specialist unit. The agreed shared guidelines and SLA will ensure closer working and improved patient care.\\n\\nAction points for the UKKA and BTS\\n\\nEach organisation is to take the following actions.\\n\\n1. Share recommendations with the kidney care and transplant communities.\\n\\n2. Contact patient associations to assist with considering the role of patients and their carers in highlighting where their specialist care is undertaken/provided and who to contact.\\n\\n3. Share with the Royal College of Physicians Patient Safety Committee.\\n\\nWe note that the 3 points above are for consideration of the UKKA and the BTS and therefore make no comment.', 'Thank you for your Report to Prevent Future Deaths (hereafter “Report”) dated 12 November 2024 concerning the death of John Frederick Doyle on 30 December 2023.

Communication\\n\\n“Whilst consideration had been given to conversations with the service user in this situation, the court heard evidence from those supporting Alison (including community mental health nurses) that they were unclear on the stage the process had reached, the specific steps of the process and the likely timescales involved. This affected the type of support they could provide. There was a lack of evidence of a specific approach or policy addressing how the process can be clearly communicated to those supporting service users in the community of a specific approach or policy addressing how the process can be clearly communicated to those supporting service users in the community.”\\n\\nIt is acknowledged that a change in accommodation can result in period of uncertainty in any individual’s life and this can be particularly unsettling where that individual has a history of significant mental health difficulties and has spent a period residing in a specialist residential setting, as was the case here. In such circumstances any proposed or actual changes in accommodation require very careful management and consideration alongside clear and effective communication with both the individual and the professionals or multi-disciplinary team (MDT) supporting that individual. A lack of clear communication between professionals supporting an individual can impact on the type and effectiveness of professional support provided to them.\\n\\nThe Adult Social Care Team have carefully considered this matter and reviewed my department’s current processes and policies around communication with individuals and other agencies supporting accommodation moves proposed and actual. As a result, the team are improving our current processes by creating a visual flowchart of the accommodation process from beginning to end so that all those involved can clearly see what the next steps are and how close the individual is to any proposed move. Within the flow chart, Adult Social Care workers will be reminded that they must include the MDT working with the individual concerned (including care providers and Community Mental Health Teams) so that accurate information can be shared regarding future plans, and appropriate actions taken. To improve communication with those supporting or close to an individual, this flowchart will be shared with an individual, their current care provider, family or friends’ representatives so that uncertainty around the process is minimised. This flow chart is in the planning stages; it will be introduced in February 2025.\\n\\nIt should be noted that timeframes for any change of accommodation can often be unpredictable due to a range of factors including availability of a particular property, procurement processes to identify support providers and legal or administrative steps to begin a tenancy. Communication at each step of the process needs to be clear, and where uncertainty arises there is a plan in place with all involved to provide reassurance to the individual at the centre and those supporting the individual.\\n\\nThe Adult Social Care Workers will be provided with communication from the department within our weekly internal newsletter, which directs them to our key goal: that staff are aware of the need to reassure individuals at each stage of the process, check for clarification of understanding, and ensure that providers and other professionals are made aware of any raised anxiety levels. The newsletter will also direct staff to be person-centred when considering the date or timescales of a move and to avoid any periods of time where an individual may already be experiencing stress or anxiety. This information will be included in the newsletter circulated week commencing 13th January 2025.\\n\\n2. Internal Review\\n\\n“Further, no internal review was carried out at Leicestershire County Council following Alison's death. If such reviews are not conducted this could lead to inadequate learning from deaths which creates a risk of further deaths.”\\n\\nMy understanding is that on the fourth day of the inquest, clarification was sought from, and provided by Counsel representing Leicestershire County Council on the fact that Leicestershire County Council had not carried out an internal review in this case and the reasons for the same, but that during the course of the inquest witness evidence and submissions were not sought on Leicestershire County Council’s internal investigation processes.\\n\\nNevertheless, in light of this concern being raised in the RPRD, I have considered this matter and consultation has occurred within the department around the internal review process for when an unexpected death occurs.\\n\\nThere are existing policies and procedures already in place in line with the statutory duties on local authorities to make safeguarding adults enquiries under s42 of the Care Act 2014 including responding to Safeguarding Alerts and undertaking Safeguarding Enquiries. As explained during the inquest, in Alison’s case, Derbyshire County Council’s adult social care department were the lead authority for the s42 enquiry. However, we acknowledge that there is a need to communicate clarity around roles and responsibilities for Leicestershire County Council as the commissioning authority where an individual is living outside of this authority’s geographical area, as was the case here. Furthermore, staff have been reminded that strategy discussions and meetings should clearly detail any elements of a Safeguarding Enquiry that are being delegated by the host authority to any other parties.\\n\\nThe RPRD has identified the need for an internal review process also. Accordingly, a procedure has been developed for all Adult Social Care managers which will go live in January 2025 to ensure that where an unexpected death occurs, an internal review takes place to consider the departments involvement, the views of those involved, and whether there are any specific learning points or amendments to policies or processes required.\"]), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/kirsten-hocking-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0617', recipients=['Probation Service', 'Steps2Recovery'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='There is a real lack of specialist rehabilitation accommodation for women who pose low or medium risk to others but high risk of self-harm, with limited access to Approved Premises and reliance on small charities leading to patchy provision and unclear access criteria.'), ConcernItem(concern='Probation officers responsible for arranging accommodation and release plans lack sufficient knowledge about the availability and limitations of specialist accommodation options, including Approved Premises, resulting in inadequate planning and support for released individuals.'), ConcernItem(concern='The charity Steps to Recovery (S2R) has unclear systems regarding placement offers, conditions, and decision-making processes, including insufficient recording and communication, which risks inappropriate withdrawal of accommodation offers without consulting relevant parties.')]), responses=['Steps2Recovery (S2R) acknowledges the findings and conclusions outlined in the Coroner’s report regarding the sad death of Kirsten Hocking and the concerns raised and herein responds to the concern directed to S2R. We would like again to send our condolences to Kirsten’s family. We remain committed to learning from these events and ensuring that every possible action is taken to address the issues raised. Our organization is dedicated to improving our processes, strengthening communication, and refining our approach to supporting vulnerable individuals in need of rehabilitation. The concern raised was as follows:- “S2R started providing this kind of specialist accommodation because there was such a pressing need for more of it. They are to be welcomed for having done so. However, like many small organisations which have grown, it appears that their systems have not always grown with them. Work is already being done, but there remains a continuing risk. Placement offers and the conditions and expectations which attach to them are too unclear. The recording of decisions around offers, withdrawal, and reconsideration, also needs to be better, not just to ensure that decisions are recorded, but also to ensure that decision making is properly structured and takes all relevant matters into account. Withdrawing accommodation offers without first speaking to the requesting organisation (in this case staff at the prison) also gives rise to risks. As this case shows, these are critically important decisions, and great care is required.” In response to this, we have reviewed the findings in detail and have implemented the following measures to address the concern raised and more: 1. Clarity in Communication with Potential Admissions All potential admissions are informed during the assessment process that they are required to remain fully abstinent from drugs and alcohol. Additionally, it will now include clearer parameters relating to issues such as, but not limited to; self-harm, suicide, prescribed medication, criminality, mobility and physical health. Any changes in these circumstances may lead to a re-evaluation of their application by a multidisciplinary team, which may include third-party input and may result in the withdrawal of their offer. This information will always be provided in writing in clear and unambiguous terms, as well as communicated verbally. We have implemented a new ‘Offer/Acceptance’ document that details the offer, on which any conditions placed on our offers will be clearly communicated in written form and sent to the main point of contact and where appropriate cc’d to other involved parties. This single document can then be accessed by other involved parties and eliminates any confusion as to what is required to fulfil a successful placement. As part of the review of our case management system ‘Lamplight’, this form will be available on clients’ individual files. 2. Obligations of Referring Services Referring services, such as Probation Services, HMP Services and substance misuse commissioning agents, will now be explicitly informed during the assessment stage that they must notify S2R, in a timely manner, of any changes in the circumstances of prospective clients. This includes, but not limited to, updates related to mental health, physical health, self-harm, suicide risk, drug or alcohol use, or any other significant issue. We will, whenever possible, recommend to referring services that alternative placements should be considered as a precaution, in case conditions change and the place offered by us is at risk. 3. Documentation of Communication & Decision Making. To provide further robustness and transparency all communications, discussions, and decisions, with regards to the prospective client, will be recorded on Lamplight, and regularly audited by our new senior management team. This ensures robust documentation and accountability of decision making. 4. Pre-Arrival Updates from Referring Services In addition to our normal application process, and to ensure preparedness, S2R will contact the referring service two weeks prior to the client’s arrival to confirm there have been no changes in circumstances. If circumstances have changed, which may lead to the withdrawal of the offer, the referring service will be contacted and have input into the final decision before it is made. 5. Leadership Experience. We have appointed new executive team members, with a new Head of Therapy and CEO to further develop the delivery of our services. We have also expanded our board of Trustees to include someone with extensive experience in clinical management. 6. Policy and Procedure Review S2R has engaged an external consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of all policies and procedures, including but not limited to: Referrals, Assessment and Admissions, Self-Harm and Suicide Risk, Planned and Unplanned Discharges. The reviewed policies will now incorporate all the aforementioned processes and actions, ensuring a robust framework moving forward. 7. Staff Training S2R provides mandatory continuous training to ensure all staff are fully trained on the updated processes, recording of decision-making, policies and procedures. 8. Enhancements to Case Management System S2R has undertaken a thorough review of its case management system, Lamplight, and is collaborating with Lamplight to ensure the system operates at its most efficient and effective configuration. Comprehensive further staff training on the Lamplight system will then be provided to ensure its optimal use and accuracy in documentation. We remain committed to continuous improvement and to providing the highest level of care and support for the individuals we serve. We continue to take all necessary steps to minimise risk and ensure a more robust service to the vulnerable individuals who rely on Steps2recovery.', 'I refer to your Regulation 28 Report following the Inquest into the death of Kirsten Hocking and am issuing this response on behalf of the Probation Service. I know that you will share a copy of this response with her family, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere condolences for their loss. You expressed a concern that there was and remains a real lack of specialist rehabilitation for women, and in particular, women who represent only a low or medium risk of harm to others, but a high risk of self-harm. This cohort are for the most part shut out from Approved Premises (“AP”) (it appears that it is possible for medium risk women to be admitted to an AP but that possibility is not well understood and the reality is that it is not available; that kind of accommodation being very over-subscribed in any event). This means there is little or no effective system of rehabilitative provision for that cohort. This is a cohort in which the state has invested a great deal of time and money (in imprisoning and rehabilitative work) only, the evidence suggests, for that investment to be at risk of being squandered on release. It also means that provision can become dependent on small charities and acts of individual generosity, which is patchwork and may bring problems of unclear access and unclear criteria (as happened here). The evidence was that this was being looked at by the Probation Service, which does not generally provide specialist rehabilitation accommodation itself but which has an obvious interest in it being available and so is monitoring the situation. However the evidence was also that the situation is getting worse not better, particularly for women (who tend to have higher levels of self-harm), and this is despite things like the Corston review in 2007 and the case of Coll v SSJ ten years later, which found discrimination because of the gender disparity with respect to the availability of APs. There is now a similar lack, and apparent gender impact, with regard to specialist rehabilitation accommodation too. The circumstances creating the risk of other deaths therefore subsist and might benefit from some renewed focus. From the start of this year, new initiatives have been launched by Government to improve outcomes for women in custody and on probation. These include the creation of the Women’s Justice Board and the introduction of The Women’s Policy Framework and accompanying operational guidance which was developed with over 250 probation practitioners and subject matter experts. This supports HMPPS staff across custody and in the community to deliver consistent practice which is gender-specific and trauma informed and includes mandatory actions for working with women. The expectation is that this new oversight from the Women’s Justice Board will renew focus on the accommodation requirements for women who find themselves in the criminal justice system. With specific reference to the female Approved Premises estate, the need to accommodate women with a wide range of needs is recognised and the estate does aim to accommodate women with complex needs who may pose a medium risk of harm. There is a new Central Referral Process which is managed by a dedicated Female Central Referral Unit Manager who has experience of such cases and can best assess the need for an AP space. Such spaces are also available for women who are subject to a community-based disposal, not just for those on licence release. Linked to your first concern, you commented that probation officers, who have primary responsibility for finding accommodation and building release plans, need to understand what accommodation is and is not available. This case showed that no-one, including the relevant officer, realised that an AP might in theory have been available. It also showed a failure to appreciate that once the first specialist placement fell through, a second was very unlikely to be found and so CAS3 accommodation was realistically the only option. That therefore needed finding quickly, so that a support plan could be built around it. There does therefore seem to be a training need. The Central Approved Premises Team are currently promoting the use of community disposals with Probation Court Teams across the county – which prevent the loss of accommodation due to a period in custody. They are also engaging with regional females leads (senior probation officers) to promote the availability of placements in an Approved Premises for women with complex needs who pose a medium risk of harm. From September this year, there will be Female AP briefings for all practitioners where this exact point will be emphasised. Thank you again for bringing your concerns to my attention. I trust that this response provides assurance that action is being taken to address the issues you raised.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/vera-spencer-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0616', recipients=['NHS Derby & Derbyshire Integrated Care Board'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='The ambulance service categorises falls as lower priority during extreme pressure, causing individuals who have fallen at home to wait many hours on the floor before paramedics attend.'), ConcernItem(concern='Long waits on the floor after a fall increase the risk of pneumonia, pressure damage, and rhabdomyolysis.'), ConcernItem(concern='There is no local falls service or team operating out of hours to assess patients and assist them off the floor following a fall, other than the ambulance service.')]), responses=[\"Derby & Derbyshire ICB extend our sympathies to the family and friends of Mrs Vera Spencer over their loss. Secondly, we have examined the issues you raised in the regulation 28 notice.\\n\\nAt the time of Vera's fall, the Team Up falls service was resourced to support non-injurious falls, so an individual with a fractured hip would not have been suitable for that type of response.\\n\\nWe are aware that some areas have since progressed into supporting injurious falls, and the plan is for all others to follow suit.\\n\\nAction 1: Derby & Derbyshire ICB will seek to accelerate the development and roll out of a falls prevention service that is available to all residents in Derby & Derbyshire that includes consideration of an injurious falls service. This will be considered through in the local NHS planning & prioritisation process for 2025/26.\\n\\nLong lies are variable in their effect on an individual, this is usually based on their co-morbidities/frailty prior to the fall. If an individual is not able to be retrieved from the floor, then the main concerns are hypothermia, dehydration, immobility, severity of pain and acute kidney injury.\\n\\nIn exceptional circumstances, next of kin or responders from the above options could attend on scene and support to confirm the need for ambulance, or recover if able, and manage symptoms and risks e.g. pain relief, temperature regulation, hydration, safe movement/pressure care, if a long wait for an ambulance is incurred. However, we are aware that in periods of severe strain upon acute & ambulance services that this approach may not always be successful in mitigating the risk of harm to patients. Therefore, the ICB recognises the need to look at further actions that may be put in place to mitigate the risk of harm.\\n\\nFurther options that the ICB will consider for alternative ambulance response out of hours:\\n\\nOption A: DHU have staff trained in falls recovery as they provide some cover for the Team Up / UCR provision. Their falls response provision could be extended to cover 20:00-08:00, and Team Up and step-up virtual wards would provide the continuation of clinical support next day. If this was in situ, this individual could have been responded to by a team, observations completed, ambulance need confirmed through on-screen head to toe assessment, perhaps an urgent visit arranged from DHU medic for pain relief. It is likely that with a hip fracture suspected, the responders would not be able to safely lift the individual off the floor (teams only have seated lifted equipment). This option would offer the person in person support, confirmation of need and pain and other symptom management, but not remove the need for ambulance attendance in this case.\\n\\nOption B: EMAS have a community first responder network who are volunteers and trained in falls recover, deployed exclusively by EMAS EOC. The provision can be variable in the hours available, and geographies covered However we can explore the possible extension of this service for the people of Derby & Derbyshire. Again, these teams would be limited to providing on scene support/monitoring but would likely not be able to recover the individual as they only have access to seated lifting equipment.\\n\\nOption C: ICB to consult with technology enabled care providers to ensure they consider the provision of community-based response as an integral part of their services. Where TEC services do not provide in person response, there is an increased dependence/reliance on ambulance services for attendance to pendant alarm alerts. However, like the above option, if the TEC provider had attended in person, and confirmed the individual was significantly injured, the team would not recover, keep the individual safe, and escalate to the ambulance service to attend.\\n\\nOption D: The district and borough technology enabled care providers that we have commissioned as part of the Team Up Enhanced falls response; all operate as 24/7 responding services for their main service provision (fee paying TEC services). Therefore, they could be commissioned by the ICB to extend this enhanced offer to cover 24/7, maintaining similar processes we have in place now for UCR. The provision offered by these providers is limited to Derby City, High Peak (excluding Glossop currently), Chesterfield, South Derbyshire, Bolsover, and parts of NE Derbyshire and therefore DHU would potentially offer a solution for the remainder.\\n\\nAction 2: Derby & Derbyshire ICB will seek to implement options that further mitigate the risk of a long lie following a fall that is available to all residents in Derby & Derbyshire.\\n\\nDerby & Derbyshire ICB recognise that there are times when the East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) is under extreme pressure. These situations lead to unacceptable response times for severely ill and injured people within our community. Indeed we have just come out of an unprecedented EMAS critical incident due to such pressures.\\n\\nIn this critical incident the local NHS worked together with the local authorities and the voluntary sector to reduce the response times for patients in the community. In the short term we will continue to work as a multi-agency group to try and minimise response times by EMAS. In the medium term we recognise that we will need to identify ways in which the demand for healthcare and healthcare beds can be reduced. This will require a blended approach that looks at:\\n\\n1. Reducing the flow of people into our urgent & emergency care services through prevention\\n2. Improving flow through our acute sector and reducing length of stay in hospital beds. In the short term we have the local roll out of a technology known as Optica that has a proven ability to reduce length of stay in hospital settings\\n3. Continued working with social and voluntary care services to improve the speed of discharge of people when they are well back to their usual home setting.\"]), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/imogen-heap-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0620', recipients=['National Institute for Health & Care Excellence (NICE)'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='There is an under-appreciation of the risks posed by elevated levels of propranolol medication, despite its widespread prescription, often to young people reporting anxiety symptoms.')]), responses=['I write in response to your regulation 28 report dated 8 November 2024 regarding the sad death of Imogen Heap.

The MHRA stated that ‘The issue of whether or not a DSU was warranted was considered within MHRA in Autumn 2024 and then discussed at one of the monthly DSU planning meetings where a decision was taken not to issue a safety communication. One of the concerns with any communication was inadvertently raising the profile of propranolol overdose. A couple of factors which were taken into consideration are that (i) quite a lot of overdoses with propranolol are mixed overdoses of more than one drug, and that (ii) propranolol is used very widely with millions of items prescribed and used safely each year’. Therefore, our conclusion is that we will not be updating CG113 at this time.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/alexander-rogers-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0624', recipients=['The Department for Education'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='Social ostracism is a recognised practice within student communities and may be prevalent across UK universities.'), ConcernItem(concern=\"Students use social ostracism as a form of 'self-policing' in response to allegations of serious misconduct without formal investigation or evidence.\"), ConcernItem(concern='Social ostracism has severe and lasting negative impacts on mental health, including increased risk factors for suicide.'), ConcernItem(concern='There is a lack of trust in formal processes for reporting serious concerns, leading students to resort to social ostracism.'), ConcernItem(concern='Social ostracism has become normalised within student communities, hindering the development of healthy and supportive social environments.')]), responses=['Thank you for sending the Regulation 28/Prevention of Future Deaths Report (the Report) to the Department for Education (DfE) following the Inquest into the tragic death by suicide of Alexander Rogers, and for bringing your concerns to our attention.\\n\\nHaving sought your consent, we have shared the Report with the Office for Students (OfS), the independent regulator for higher education in England. The OfS are responsible for protecting the interests of students in the higher education sector and we have included actions OfS are taking as part of our response. We have also spoken to representatives of the University of Oxford and with Dr [redacted], who as you know, led the serious incident review, in forming our response.\\n\\nMental health and suicide prevention\\nI wish to first express my condolences to Alexander’s loved ones who have suffered unimaginable loss. I know the impact of this would have also been felt widely among the student community.\\nThis government is committed to tackling suicide as one of this country’s leading causes of death for younger people. We are recruiting 8,500 new mental health workers who will be specially trained to support people at risk from suicide. We also continue to implement the five-year multi-sector and cross-government suicide prevention strategy, which set out a comprehensive set of actions to reduce the rates of suicide in England.\\nIn higher education, we have taken the issues of mental health and suicide prevention extremely seriously. We are taking action in partnership with the OfS and the sector to ensure students are better supported. Our Higher Education Support Champion, Professor [redacted], is leading a Higher Education Mental Health Implementation Taskforce representing students, bereaved parents, the health and higher education sectors and mental health and suicide experts. It aims to bring about meaningful change in mental health practice and has recently published its second stage report.\\nTo ensure universities are taking a whole university approach to mental health, the OfS has provided £400,000 of funding to the student mental health charity, Student Minds. This has enabled significant expansion of the University Mental Health Charter Programme, with 113 universities now signed up and committed to embedding the Charter’s principles. This includes principles such as universities ‘actively encouraging healthy behaviours’ and ‘community-building’, which are relevant to the matters raised in your Report.\\nOffice for National Statistics data suggests that the higher education student suicide rate is significantly lower compared to those of similar ages in the general population, with 64 deaths by suicide occurring in England and Wales in academic year ending 2020. However, we are clear that we expect higher education providers to go further in their efforts and take all reasonable steps to support students and prevent suicides. That is why we have asked a team of suicide experts at the University of Manchester, overseen by Professor [redacted], to conduct a National Review of Higher Education Student Suicides (the National Review). We have seen exceptional engagement from the higher education sector, and the National Review will report in the Spring with valuable lessons learned and recommendations for better prevention of student suicides. We would expect this to comment on whether similar issues have arisen as those highlighted in your Report.\\nTo support engagement with the National Review and enable higher education providers to develop mental health and suicide prevention strategies, DfE has made available £15 million in funding this academic year 2024/25, allocated via the OfS, to English higher education providers.\\nThe OfS and Medr (formerly the Higher Education Funding Council Wales) have also worked with Student Minds to provide direct support to students, investing more than £3.6 million to develop Student Space. Since 2020 it has since provided over 620,000 students with free online mental health resources and confidential support.\\n\\nSocial ostracism and lack of trust in formal processes\\nAs well as those actions in train already on student mental health there are additional steps being taken to address the other particular matters of concern raised in your Report - social ostracism and lack of trust among students in formal processes:\\n\\n1) Action by the OfS to bring more consistency and rigour to the handling of harassment and sexual misconduct allegations in higher education settings.\\nThe OfS has introduced new regulatory requirements for preventing and addressing harassment and sexual misconduct which will be a condition of being registered with the OfS. This new condition of registration (condition E6) will come into force from August 2025. DfE and the OfS are working with sector bodies to help providers implement the new measures. All universities and colleges registered with the OfS will be required to publish and maintain policies and procedures that set out how they will deal with incidents of harassment and sexual misconduct. They will need to provide students with training on policies and processes, and ensure they understand behaviour that may constitute harassment and sexual misconduct. The new condition will require universities and colleges registered with the OfS to set out the ways in which students, staff and others are able to report behaviour that may amount to harassment or sexual misconduct and how this information will be handled sensitively and used fairly. Higher education providers registered with the OfS will also need be clear about the appropriate support that will be provided to students in response to incidents. This includes students who are reporting experiencing incidents of harassment and sexual misconduct, and actual or alleged perpetrators.\\nWe believe changes brought about following the introduction of these new mandatory requirements for providers registered with the OfS will lead to significant improvements in the understanding of students and their confidence in the system; this will support greater engagement with reporting mechanisms and enable providers to better support both alleged victims and alleged perpetrators.\\n\\n2) We will work with experts and leading university student welfare officials and students to convene a roundtable in early 2025 exploring the issues around social ostracism and lack of trust in formal processes in more depth.\\nThis will build on work being led by the University of Oxford to establish a working group on social ostracism and open discussions around how students can ‘disagree well’ and engage with ‘constructive dialogue’. The intention of the roundtable is to build shared knowledge on the issue, understand what gaps there may be currently in action in the higher education sector and appropriate responses. Insights and outputs which emerge following the roundtable will be publicised.\\n\\nWe would like to thank you again for your Report and a redacted extract from Dr. Thompson’s review. We believe that working with OfS and the higher education sector to learn lessons and take strong action in response is the best way to stop further tragedies from occurring. We trust that this response will provide the reassurance and information that you seek.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/anne-taylor-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0614', recipients=['Salford Royal Hospital Foundation Trust', 'NHS England'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='The deceased left the hospital before clinical assessment due to waiting times, indicating a risk related to patient discharge processes.'), ConcernItem(concern='There was no consideration of conducting secondary investigations, such as CT scans, during the waiting period before clinical assessment.'), ConcernItem(concern=\"The deceased's capacity to decide to leave the hospital was not assessed despite a history of suspected head injury.\"), ConcernItem(concern='The content and effectiveness of the new standard operating procedure for patients leaving before clinical assessment are unclear.')]), responses=['Thank you for your Report to Prevent Future Deaths (hereafter “Report”) dated 8 November 2024 concerning the death of Anne Taylor on 31 July 2024.

This will include oversight of patient pathways including discharge planning.\\n\\nNHS England recognises the significant pressures on all NHS services and, in January 2023, published a two-year Delivery plan for recovering urgent and emergency care (UEC) services. The plan prioritised improvements to four hour performance in Emergency Departments and outlined key actions to recover and improve urgent and emergency care services. Despite significant challenges, including higher than anticipated demand, there has been a marked improvement in the headline ambition, with over 2.5 million more people completing their Accident & Emergency treatment within four hours in 2023/24 compared to 2022/23.\\n\\nNHS England is working to support its regions to support providers to eliminate crowding in Emergency Departments in the longer term. Improvements are being demonstrated through NHS England’s operational planning guidance where health systems were asked to focus on areas to deliver improved patient flow and this has included increasing the productivity of acute and non-acute hospital services, improving flow as well as clinical outcomes.\\n\\nI would also like to provide further assurances on the national NHS England work taking place around the Reports to Prevent Future Deaths. All reports received are discussed by the Regulation 28 Working Group, comprising Regional Medical Directors, and other clinical and quality colleagues from across the regions. This ensures that key learnings and insights around events, such as the sad death of Anne, are shared across the NHS at both a national and regional level and helps us to pay close attention to any emerging trends that may require further review and action.', 'Thank you for bringing the concerns raised in the Regulation 28 report to my attention. Your concerns were as follows:\\n\\n1. During evidence, it was heard that the deceased had elected to leave the Hospital on Friday 19 July because of waiting times, before being clinically assessed.\\n2. There was no consideration of whether secondary investigations could be undertaken during the waiting time for example CT scan which would likely be required by a clinician to make a diagnosis.\\n3. No evidence was provided that the deceased’s mental capacity to decide to leave the hospital was assessed given the history of suspected head injury.\\n4. Reference was made to a new standard operating procedure being developed relating to patients leaving the hospital before a clinical assessment occurs, but it was unclear what this will include.\\n\\nI understand that following Mrs Taylor re-attending hospital on 20th July 2024, and the diagnosis of acute subdural haematoma being made, a clinical incident was immediately reported by a nurse in the Emergency Department regarding the ED attendance the previous evening. This incident was triaged via our usual governance systems, and it was felt that although an earlier diagnosis would sadly not have changed the outcome for Mrs Taylor, there was an opportunity for learning and improving our systems and so an After-Action Review was undertaken under the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF).\\n\\nThe review determined that going forwards secondary investigations (such as a CT scan) should be considered and frontloaded for patients who are identified as meeting NICE guidelines criteria for CT scan in head injury, whilst they await clinical review. The new NHSE Acuity tool process described below will support this.\\n\\nAdditionally, it was highlighted that at the time of Mrs Taylor’s attendance there was no formalized Standard Operating Procedure within Salford Royal’s Emergency Department defining the actions to take when a patient leaves before clinical assessment. Salford site has an electronic self-discharge checklist designed for ward-based use, but no guidance or policy to describe the appropriate completion of this, or relevant steps to take, in the emergency department setting.\\n\\nA Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for patients who leave the emergency department whilst waiting to be seen has now been drafted and is going through NCA approval processes, with an estimated approval date of 6th February 2025. We append the working draft for your information. This guideline sets out the responsibilities of clinical and nursing staff when an adult leaves an emergency care setting prior to being assessed or receiving treatment, so that the patient is safeguarded appropriately with the aim of:\\n\\n\\x183 Ensuring patients receive appropriate healthcare.\\n\\x183 To help identify patients who are at risk of coming to harm.\\n\\x183 Ensuring patients have the mental capacity to and are supported to make their own decisions regarding their care.\\n\\nOnce approved the SOP will be shared with all urgent and emergency care areas for dissemination. In the interim, learning from the incident and draft SOP will be circulated through safety messages and in the directorate governance meeting.\\n\\nWithin this new SOP, it is made clear to nursing and clinical staff that it is their responsibility to assess mental capacity for patients stating they want to leave and to escalate any concerns appropriately. Patients who wish to take their own discharge and are assessed to have the mental capacity to do so, should be safety netted, with NCA leaflets related to their presentation and verbal advice as indicated. The documentation review, actions taken, and record of discussions, should be clearly documented in the patient’s notes.\\n\\nIn addition to the above, as of 25th November 2024, Salford Royal Hospital has become an early adopter of the NHSE Acuity Tool, an initial assessment model which aims to standardize the measurement of acuity in Emergency Departments and Urgent Treatment Centres. Patients who attend the ED at Salford Royal now receive an initial, primary assessment to identify patients with an acuity 1, 2 or 5 which will allow them to either be directed immediately to a receiving location or be directed to an alternative provider such as primary care. Acuity 1 patients are those with immediate life/limb threatening illness/injury, acuity 2 are those with imminent life/limb threatening illness/injury and acuity 5 denotes no threat to life or limb, no ED specific resource necessary. Patients who do not meet an acuity 1, 2 or 5 will then go on to receive a secondary assessment. The target time for secondary assessment is 15 minutes, Salford Care Organisation are on track to achieve this. Progress of the early adopter programme is being shared with NHSE at regular intervals. Patients receiving a secondary assessment can be identified for early clinical intervention and front loading of essential investigations such as, CT scan. Work is ongoing to meet the NHSE secondary assessment target to provide the significant benefits it offers of reducing the risk of patients with serious conditions sitting in the waiting room for a long time undiagnosed. In addition, the new acuity tool, has a specific question regarding mental capacity assessment relating to a patient’s decision to leave the department.\\n\\nThe Trust is always open to the opportunity to review, and where possible, strengthen our processes. I hope this response offers assurance to you that the Trust has continued to take these concerns seriously and has put in place a number of steps and actions since the tragic death of Mrs Taylor.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/lacey-brookman-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0612', recipients=['President Royal, Royal College of General Practitioners', 'President of the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health', 'President of the Royal College of Surgeons', 'President of the Royal College of Radiologists'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='Neither the original GP, the reviewing surgical SHO, nor the surgical registrar considered that Lacey had appendicitis, and the consultant surgeon was unable to reach a diagnosis despite recognizing illness.'), ConcernItem(concern='Retrocaecal appendicitis is not a rare presentation of acute appendicitis or generalised abdominal pain, yet this was not adequately considered.'), ConcernItem(concern='There is a need for availability and use of bedside or departmental ultrasound scanning for abdominal pain cases, especially out of hours.'), ConcernItem(concern='Doctors require improved training to consider appendicitis as a possible differential diagnosis in cases of generalised abdominal pain.')]), responses=[\"The senior Officers of the Royal College of Surgeons of England have carefully considered your report, alongside those senior surgeons and staff involved in setting the surgical curricula, and our education and policy departments. Our belief is that early formal clinical examination and adjunctive investigations of abdominal ultrasound +/- abdominal CT scan, in cases of doubt, would have aided early diagnosis of this problem, as noted in your report.\\n\\nAs you highlight, retrocaecal appendicitis is not a rare presentation. Within the postgraduate Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme, its diagnosis and management are addressed through the Core Surgery, Paediatric Surgery and General Surgery curricula, as part of the focus on acute appendicitis and acute abdominal conditions. The condition therefore forms part of the syllabus of the Intercollegiate MRCS and FRCS (Gen Surg) & (Paed Surg) examinations. While we believe current curricula coverage is adequate, we recognise the importance of continually reviewing our curricula and we have shared your report with our Specialty Advisory Committee Chairs for their consideration during upcoming curricula reviews.\\n\\nThe curriculum refers to that followed by surgeons in training, with a national training number to acquire a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT), and those on the specialist register via the CESR / portfolio pathways. It should be noted that not all surgical doctors are on training pathways or following a specific curriculum, and that not all Consultants employed as such by the NHS are currently on the specialist register, and therefore will have variable experience and training, not formally assessed by the Royal Surgical Colleges’ Joint Committee for Surgical Training (JCST). For these doctors the local employers would be responsible for ensuring their employees have the knowledge, skills and behaviour required to practice surgery at their grade/level of employment.\\n\\nThe out of hours provision of paediatric radiology services, particularly ultrasound, is a service availability and quality matter, determined by local Trusts/ICB's. It is not provided by surgeons in any point of their training or curriculum, and advice from the Royal College of Radiologists might be sought. An NCEPOD review may also help determine the current risks and requirements for a safe paediatric radiology service going forwards.\\n\\nOur education team has also reviewed your report and they are now exploring whether we can explicitly refer to retrocaecal appendicitis. Specifically, we are reviewing the content of the Care of the Critically Ill Surgical Patient (CCRISP) and the Clinical Skills in Emergency Surgery courses.

We take the matters raised in your report very seriously and I hope this letter is helpful in outlining how we are committed to learning from them.\\n\\nThe Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) is the leading professional membership body for Clinical Radiologists and Clinical Oncologists, with over 17,000 members globally. The RCR is a charity and aims to lead, educate and support its members and improve the quality of care in its specialties for the benefit of patients and the public.\\n\\nA key priority for the RCR is to advocate for expansion of the radiology workforce. RCR census data has shown severe shortages in the radiology workforce, including a 30% shortfall of Consultant in Clinical Radiology. Almost all (97%) of radiology leaders (Clinical Directors who lead imaging departments in the NHS) report that workforce shortages cause delays and backlogs and 91% of Clinical Directors said that workforce shortages are impacting negatively on patient safety.\\n\\nWe have been asked to address the diagnosis of retrocaecal appendicitis and specifically to consider availability and use of ultrasound scanning in abdominal pain at any time, but especially out of hours.\\n\\nIn formulating our response, we have sought opinion from the following Special Interest Groups affiliated with the RCR: The British Medical Ultrasound Society (BMUS), The British Society of Paediatric Radiology (BSPR), The British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (BSGAR) and The British Society of Emergency Radiology (BSER).\\n\\nSpecial Interest Groups are independent organisations who provide advice and expertise in certain areas of practice.\\n\\nRetrocaecal appendicitis is indeed relatively common as stated in your report and can be a difficult diagnosis to make clinically. All patients, including children presenting with abdominal symptoms suspicious for retrocaecal appendicitis (and other serious acute abdominal conditions), are referred for diagnostic imaging at the discretion of the clinical team treating them. The degree of urgency typically reflects the seriousness of the clinical presentation as assessed and conveyed by the referring clinician.\\n\\nSome patients remain remarkably \"well\" for a long time despite the presence and ongoing progression of serious acute abdominal pathology, and consequently the referral for diagnostic imaging may come late in the course of disease. Ultrasound and Computerised Tomography (CT) are the two commonest imaging investigations in this clinical scenario, with MRI as a relatively uncommon alternative (see RCR iRefer guideline p28).\\n\\nUltrasound and CT are widely available in all hospital settings. What is critical is that the referral for abdominal ultrasound or/and a CT scan and the associated radiologist opinion is made in the first place. This call can be very difficult and is dependent on training, experience and familiarity and with the availability of senior support for advice and discussion.\\n\\nOnce the referral is made then urgent imaging is typically available within hours of admission to hospital and the exact algorithm of whether CT or Ultrasound will be preferred depends on the precise clinical scenario as well as the local availability of equipment and suitable expertise. Ultrasound is operator dependent and there is a considerable learning curve and requirement for ongoing practice in order to master diagnosis. In experienced hands, ultrasound is a very powerful diagnostic tool for the assessment of abdominal pathology and it has great benefits in the diagnosis of conventional appendicitis in that can be a relatively rapid, portable, bed-side test that does not involve ionizing radiation. It also has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of appendicitis and discriminating from other bowel pathologies (e.g. mesenteric adenitis, inflammatory bowel disease and ovarian torsion in girls), again when used in experienced hands.\\n\\nAs with the clinical assessment of retrocaecal appendicitis, however, diagnosis with ultrasound can be challenging even with very experienced operators. In expert paediatric radiology centres abdominal ultrasound can identify appendicitis with fairly high confidence, but identifying retrocaecal appendicitis can be challenging even in such expert hands.\\n\\nWe recognise the GIRFT report: \"Paediatric acute abdominal pain and appendicectomy: Best practice pathway guidance\" from June 2022. This document does not specifically evaluate retrocaecal appendicitis but recommends ultrasound as the first line investigation in children with suspected appendicitis who require imaging with some further information around which children this will be. This report recommends the use of a risk score and imaging for those with diagnostic uncertainty, an intermediate risk score or for those whose symptoms are not resolving with a low risk score. It also details the importance of multidisciplinary working and involvement of paediatricians and general surgeons as well as paediatric surgeons when they are available.\\n\\nWe note that ultrasound was available in the centre to which Lacey presented but that tragically even provision of ultrasound and CT on the day of the referral did not facilitate curative treatment.\\n\\nMore generally, the availability of ultrasound out of hours varies greatly between hospitals. Expertise in imaging severely ill children may be limited in non-specialist centres who may not see these cases regularly and that may necessitate transferring patients to a specialist paediatric centre. NHS trusts which run most radiology services in the UK are currently further limited by workforce pressures and particularly by the availability of Consultant Radiologists because, as described above, there is currently a 30% shortage in the UK and 91% of Clinical Directors state that workforce shortages are impacting negatively on patient safety. The location of the appendix can be extremely variable within the abdomen and the GIRFT document does not specifically address retrocaecal variations of appendicitis. We are not aware of specific guidance on retrocaecal appendicitis but advocate using similar imaging strategies to general appendicitis.\\n\\nHowever, as with more conventionally sited appendicitis, ultrasound is advised as the first line of imaging investigation following rigorous clinical assessment. Even in such a scenario, if a patient does have a retrocaecal appendicitis, then the initial ultrasound may be equivocal or not show a cause for the child\\'s illness.\\n\\nThis is because the retrocaecal appendix lies behind the caecum which can contain extensive gas and ultrasound cannot penetrate air or bowel gas and may therefore not be able to visualise the enlarged appendix, surrounding inflammatory change or, an abscess related to a perforated appendicitis.\\n\\nEven readily available expert-level abdominal and bowel ultrasound in specialist centres can miss a retrocaecal appendicitis, so the availability of point of care ultrasound in this case is unlikely to have been a critical factor.\\n\\nEven if the appendix is not visualised, secondary signs can sometimes be elicited on ultrasound to raise suspicion of a diagnosis of appendicitis. On occasions, and when the appearance is initially equivocal, we advocate ongoing clinical evaluation and repeating the ultrasound at a short interval to assess for evolving features that may support a diagnosis. This is applicable whenever a positive diagnosis is not made and particularly relevant if ultimately a patient is shown to have retrocaecal appendicitis.\\n\\nOngoing, clinical assessment is essential and if there are concerning clinical features or no clinical improvement then in the severely ill child where ultrasound cannot reach a diagnosis, the child should be further evaluated with additional imaging, a CT or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan being performed depending on the clinical expertise of the centre. Alternatively, an experienced paediatric surgeon may decide to take a severely ill, deteriorating child or a child with classical clinical symptoms of appendicitis directly to the operating theatre without obtaining further imaging.\\n\\nCT can identify retrocaecal appendicitis with high confidence without the requirement for expertise in paediatric bowel ultrasound and, outside of specialist paediatric centres, CT is more widely available than the level of ultrasound which would be required to identify appendicitis in children with confidence.\\n\\nCT scanning is available 24 hours a day in all relevant hospitals in the UK, with due consideration given to the radiation exposure involved in abdominal CT in a child with non-specific symptoms. There are of course understandable reservations about referring children for CT scanning as it involves exposure to ionising radiation. It is possible that due to these reservations, together with the generally late presentation of retrocaecal appendicitis and that, as above, some children with this condition remain remarkably \"well\" for a long time, results in a delay in considering the diagnosis and consequently in making a referral for CT scanning.\\n\\nIf the exposure to radiation can be justified then CT scans with intravenous contrast of the abdomen and pelvis has the advantage over ultrasound in that the images are not obscured by gaseous distension of bowel and the appendix and associated inflammatory changes are more commonly seen. Alternatively, MRI can be used to obtain a representation of the bowel/appendix and internal organs. MRI techniques have an advantage of avoiding the use of ionizing radiation although the scanning time is typically significantly longer than CT and thereby posing particular problems in younger children who cannot lay still and the pool of experts who can confidently interpret them is smaller than that for CT.\\n\\nUltrasound, CT and MRI all require considerable training to perform and interpret correctly and the availability of abdominal ultrasound which must be performed in person may be particularly limited by availability of on-site expertise. Images for CT and MRI may be acquired locally and transmitted remotely which is a common technique in multi-site trusts or when on-call services are provided through a network.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we recognise that the diagnosis of retrocaecal appendicitis can be challenging both clinically and radiologically. We advocate prompt assessment by experienced clinicians including expert surgeons and radiologists. Given the workforce shortages in the UK and the ramifications for delayed diagnosis this may necessitate early transfer to specialist centres where paediatric surgeons and paediatric radiologists are more available.', 'Thank you for sharing a copy of your report touching on the tragic death of Lacey May Brookman. I am responding on behalf of the Royal College of General Practitioners as Honorary Secretary to Council. Firstly, can I convey our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Lacey May. It is always tragic to hear of a death of a child and also recognise the effect it has on her family and friends.\\n\\nAbdominal pain in children is a common symptom but as highlighted can be on occasions extremely serious and life threatening.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\x183 Decision to admit for Specialist Management We recognise that the second GP and possibly the A&E doctor considered that Lacey had appendicitis. Although the Registrar did not confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis and offered an alternative diagnosis, there was a recognition that Lacey required further hospital investigation and more senior decision making. This was undertaken by the Consultant Surgeon who reviewed the patient within a 24-hr period and then decided to admit and investigate. There was a further 24 hr delay before surgery at a specialised Paediatric unit by which time there were significant wider other organ responses to sepsis.\\n\\x183 Remote Consultation and Triage We recognise that original GP undertook a telephone triage consultation but used safety netting which supported the re-presentation with the second GP 3 days later. The college supports General Practitioners and other GP health professionals in undertaking Telephone consultation and Triage skills and runs courses on a regular basis which are often sold out and are a whole day event designed to offer skills to practice safe and comprehensive history taking within a telephone triage context to ensure the most appropriate outcome. The important lesson here is the consideration of the differential diagnosis of appendicitis, the history taking and examination. This point was highlighted as far back as 1961 in the BJGP journal note on Appendicitis \\x1a GP who has to rely on his careful assessment of the patient\\x19s symptoms and history should be able to make a much more accurate diagnosis in the majority of cases, than one who relies on less exacting examinations\\x1b. We recognise that the general skills for telephone consultation and triage in a modern age are important when General Practice is managing a significant proportion of on the day care. The work is therefore a core component of the GP Curriculum and GP Training and within the Clinical topic guides an area on Urgent and Unscheduled care which outlines the important issues relating this including a knowledge and skills guide highlighting appendicitis as one of a range of common and important conditions to be considered.\\n\\x183 Appendicitis and Managing Uncertainty The anatomical position of the appendix can vary considerably and drive the presentation. Many GPs use the NICE CKS guidance, and the current guidance highlights retrocaecal appendicitis and its features which may not include tenderness to deep palpation and muscular rigidity due to the distinct position of the appendix lying behind the caecum. The incidence of a retrocaecal appendicitis is between 20 and 65% and therefore not an uncommon presentation however its features are not as differentiating as other anatomical positions, and this may cause some delay in diagnosis. NHS England and the GIRFT team (Getting it Right First time) have reviewed the management of appendicitis from a prehospital through to hospital and discharge, Paediatric acute abdominal pain and appendicectomy, Best Practice pathway guidance .This work was undertaken by the NHS England National Clinical Director for Paediatrics Simon Kenny a Paediatric surgeon alongside a working group which included two General Practitioners with Urgent care experience. The pathway recommends close working between Paediatricians and the Surgical team, however it seems in the Regulation 28 report that there was no mention of the Paediatric team being involved in Lacey\\x19s care. The pathway also promotes a case study which supports increasing the availability of imaging in centres admitting children with abdominal pain (see Case study 6E Reducing variation in access to abdominal ultrasound). This pathway aims to reduce the unwarranted variation in unnecessary appendicectomies for children presenting with abdominal pain for other reasons through more accurate and timely diagnosis. This issue of retrocaecal appendicitis and the associated diagnostic dilemma is not raised in the pathway, and this may be an area to investigate further.\\n\\nIn answer to your matters of concern regarding suspecting appendicitis, it remains a common condition presenting with a range of clinical signs and symptoms which may vary according to anatomical and pathological variation. There is a potential risk of underdiagnosis for a variant of the condition \\x1aretrocaecal appendicitis\\x1b which often presents in the later stages due to a delay in the symptom of pain. This creates diagnostic uncertainty, potential delay in investigation and hospital management. There are diagnostic solutions such as bedside ultrasound scanning, however this is not routinely available in either hospital emergency departments and not in the urgent and emergency care settings of General Practice. This would need policy change and a prioritisation of investment as well as training development opportunities in primary care settings.\\n\\nNHS England and the GIRFT team have recently produced the Best Practice Guide and have an established process for its implementation which supports a whole pathway approach, however the guide does not specifically reference retrocaecal appendicitis. Most GPs refer to NICE CKS guidance which does specifically mention the presentation of retrocaecal appendicitis. The Royal College of General Practitioners remains committed to supporting ongoing educational resources for both the GP Curriculum and Continuing Professional Development in this area.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/gemma-ralph-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0613', recipients=['Cannock Chase Hospital', 'NHS England'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='Bottles of sevoflurane, whether unopened or partially used after theatre, are not robustly monitored, allowing removal from Cannock Chase Hospital without detection by the auditing system.'), ConcernItem(concern=\"The trust was unable to confirm or refute whether the bottle of sevoflurane found at the deceased's home originated from Cannock Chase Hospital.\")]), responses=['Following the inquest on 3 October 2024, you raised the following concerns in relation to this trust:\\n\\n1. That bottles of sevoflurane, whether unopened or partially used after theatre, does not appear to be robustly monitored to the degree that it was possible for a bottle of sevoflurane to be removed from Cannock Chase Hospital without this being flagged by the auditing system.\\n\\n2. That the trust was unable to confirm or refute that the bottle found at the deceased’s home address originated from Cannock Chase Hospital.\\n\\nIt is important to note that no witnesses from the trust called to attend court and evidence provided by the trust was read, there was therefore no opportunity for the trust to present or clarify any contextual matters that may have arisen during the inquest hearing.\\n\\nThis letter sets out the trust’s response to the Regulation 28 notice received on 8 November 2024.\\n\\nFor context:\\n\\nInhaled sevoflurane is used to cause general anaesthesia (loss of consciousness) before and during surgery. It belongs to the group of medicines known as general anaesthetics.\\n\\nThere are a range of general anaesthetics available in theatre for anaesthetists to choose based on the specific need of the case.\\n\\nSome are delivered via an intravenous (IV) route (directly into a vein), but most are delivered via an inhaled route (breathed in) and are known as Anaesthetic Gases, those in common used across the country are nitrous oxide, halothane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane. They are administered as primary therapy for preoperative sedation and adjunctive anaesthesia maintenance to intravenous (IV) anaesthetic agents such as midazolam and propofol in the perioperative setting.\\n\\nThe Anaesthetic Gases are delivered by an anaesthetic machine through a breathing circuit (pipes) attached to the patients airway, The types of device to secure the airway can range from open, semi closed and closed, this means the exact amount given to each patient is difficult to record with precision because it is varied throughout the surgical procedure to lighten or deepen the anaesthetic based on a number of patient and surgical factors and circuit leakage can be variable dependent on the type of airway securing device chosen. They are usually administered by and under the direct supervision of a trained anaesthesia professional. This is normal practice across England.\\n\\nStaff who are permitted legitimate role-based access to all drugs are trusted across England to use these drugs appropriately, this is conventional and established current practice in all departments where drugs are used to treat patients.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that, in reality, any drug in the right quantity can end life. The system in place in England is that only drugs classified under the Controlled Drugs (Supervision of management and use) Regulations 2013 etc are required to be recorded from production to end use (patient or disposal). There is no such requirement for other drugs.\\n\\nThis presents complexity and difficulty for the trust in delivering meaningful compliance with the request in the Regulation 28 report, however the trust can and will make improvements which are summarised at the end of this letter. The trust complies with the guidance required as presented in my report presented to the inquest (attached).\\n\\nAs already mentioned, there is opportunity for the trust to take some form of action in relation to this Regulation 28 notice but this will not address any risk that sits outside of the trust (the whole of England) so any action taken by the trust, in context, will provide limited risk reduction across the country.\\n\\nAddressing the concerns that you have presented specifically to the trust.\\n\\n1. That bottles of sevoflurane, whether unopened or partially used after theatre, does not appear to be robustly monitored to the degree that it was possible for a bottle of sevoflurane to be removed from Cannock Chase Hospital without this being flagged by the auditing system.\\n\\nThe context of this is explained in the narrative above, this risk contextually applies to any drug of any type that does not fall under the controlled drugs legislation. If the trust were to take some form of action in relation to sevoflurane specifically it would not close the risk of any person taking a fatal dose of any other drug that they have legitimate access to as part of their role. To take action to address this risk in all drugs would be disproportionate to the risk, would create different risks and most likely be operationally impractical and unaffordable.\\n\\n2. That the trust was unable to confirm or refute that the bottle found at the deceased’s home address originated from Cannock Chase Hospital.\\n\\nThe trust has not been provided with the batch number of the sevoflurane found in Gemma’s home, even if it had been provided with the batch number it would still not evidence that the sevoflurane used by Gemma was obtained from the trust. The manufactured batches are large and supplied to many organisations. Therefore, confirming or refuting where Gemma obtained it from would only be possible if there were a trust specific permanent marker on the bottle, again this is not usual practice.\\n\\nThere have been a number of professionals involved up to now in the consideration of the practicalities of taking action in relation to this Regulation 28 notice, this includes Clinical Director Anaesthesia, Perioperative & Pain Medicine Directorate and Clinical Director of Pharmacy and Medicines Optimisation, Controlled Drugs Accountable Officer.\\n\\nThere is nothing, including making a medicine a controlled drug, that will prevent someone taking a medicine if they are intent to do so. We do not believe that it would have been possible or practical to have put anything in place to completely prevent the removal of a bottle of sevoflurane (or any other medicine), we can only make it more difficult to do this and therefore reduce the risks.\\n\\nActions that require national consideration / are outside of the control of the Trust\\n\\n• Sevoflurane is one of many drugs that has potential to be abused or misused but is not classified as a controlled drug. Only controlled drugs have strict laws around storage and documentation. The government would need to determine whether on balance of risk and evidence from this Regulation 28 notice, sevoflurane should be made a controlled drug.\\n• The Royal College of Anaesthetists determines that on a risk basis the medicine cupboards of theatres which are in use may be left open to enable emergency access, the only exception to this being controlled drugs. The Royal College may want to review their position on this and/or determine whether there are any further exceptions.\\n\\nActions that are partly within the control of the Trust\\n\\n• Scan4Safety is an NHS initiative that involves end to end barcoding of healthcare products, including medicines. It can track movement of medicines from manufacturer to patient, therefore increasing accountability and reducing the potential for fraud/diversion. We are not aware of how mature the systems are, and which Trusts in England have implemented this. If this was found to offer the potential to reduce risk, unless mandated nationally it would have limited impact on risk reduction.\\n• Making sevoflurane a controlled drug and/or implementing Scan4Safety are the only ways we think the Trust may have been able to identify, with a degree of certainty, that a single bottle of sevoflurane was unaccounted for. The Trust could consider managing sevoflurane as a controlled drug (we do this for Oramorph for example) but the practicalities of this are likely to outweigh the current risk of diversion.\\n  o These considerations are:\\n    ▪ Staff capacity to manage sevoflurane as a Controlled Drug\\n    ▪ How volume would be measured because of the characteristics of administration – possibly have to measure in full bottles and part bottles, rather than in ml.\\n    ▪ Space in CD cupboards to store\\n\\nActions that the Trust could consider to improve audit and / or restrict access to sevoflurane to authorised registered staff only are listed below.\\nThese measures would improve on what we already have but would not necessarily identify if someone was diverting small volumes of sevoflurane and therefore deliver limited effect on risk reduction.\\n• Introduce daily stock counts of full bottles, part bottles and empty bottles to ensure all are accounted for. NB. Raises the question that if we did this for sevoflurane why wouldn’t we do it for all other non-controlled drugs that could be abused. Unless this is made a national requirement it would deliver limited effect on risk reduction across England.\\n• Ensure sevoflurane is in a locked cupboard unless under direct physical supervision of the anaesthetist. No sevoflurane to be stored in anaesthetic room cupboards that are left open during a theatre list. Unless this is made a national requirement it would deliver limited effect on risk reduction across England.\\n• Implement auditable locks (swipe card / biometric) on drug storage cupboards (bulk and anaesthetic room) and ensure locked at all times (even when theatre is in use). This should mean that staff can access in an emergency without having to find keys but would provide greater security. These types of locks also allow audit of who has been accessing the cupboards. Unless this is made a national requirement it would deliver limited effect on risk reduction across England.\\n• Implement automated medicines cabinets for bulk storage and auditable locks or Abloy keys for drug storage cupboards in anaesthetic rooms. Unless this is made a national requirement it would deliver limited effect on risk reduction across England.\\n\\nWe have discussed the Regulation 28 notice with the Regional Chief Pharmacist, and he is in agreement with the above. We will however look at risk reduction strategies e.g. improved use of automation, ensuring our storage, recording and audit processes are robust.\\n\\nThe plan and timescales for what is within the trusts control and is reasonably practicable is set out below.', 'Thank you for your Report to Prevent Future Deaths (hereafter “Report”) dated 8 November 2024 concerning the death of Gemma Louise Helen Ralph on 26 January 2024. In advance of responding to the specific concerns raised in your Report, I would like to express my deep condolences to Gemma’s family and loved ones. NHS England are keen to assure the family and the Coroner that the concerns raised about Gemma’s care have been listened to and reflected upon.\\n\\nI am grateful for the further time granted to respond to your Report, and I apologise for any anguish this delay may have caused Gemma’s family or friends. I realise that responses to Coroner Reports can form part of the important process of family and friends coming to terms with what has happened to their loved ones, and I appreciate this will have been an incredibly difficult time for them.\\n\\nYour Report raised concerns over a lack of robust monitoring of the supply, storage and use of Sevoflurane at Cannock Chase Hospital, and that The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust was unable to confirm or refute that a bottle of Sevoflurane found at Gemma’s home had originated from the hospital.\\n\\nProfessional guidance on the safe and secure handling of medicines, published by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS), sets out the principles that should inform the approach of all NHS hospitals to ensuring that there are processes in place for the safe storage, supply and use of all medicines. These should include an assurance mechanism. Such processes are developed under the professional leadership of the Trust Chief Pharmacist and will be informed by a local risk assessment, which will include the potential harm caused by the inadvertent or deliberate diversion and/or misuse of the medicine, against the need for timely and appropriate access for administration to patients where clinically indicated.\\n\\nThe specific challenges that arise in operating departments are acknowledged in the RPS guidance, as access to some of the medicines used during surgery, including Sevoflurane, may be required rapidly. The Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) endorsed the RPS guidance and also subsequently published “Safe Drug Management in Anaesthetic Practice” to supplement this. The RCoA supplementary guidance reinforces the need to have processes in place that support patient safety, the health and safety of colleagues and public protection.\\n\\nThe risk of anaesthetics being diverted by colleagues was highlighted in the Care Quality Commission’s (CQC) “The safer management of controlled drugs: Annual update 2021”. They stated that they had received some reports that an anaesthetic (not Sevoflurane) was both being diverted and misused. This information was shared by the CQC and NHS England with all NHS trusts. The importance of considering the risks and possibilities associated with the potential misuse and/or diversion of anaesthetics, including where it is stored and who has access to it, was emphasised.\\n\\nThe CQC, as the independent regulator of health and social care in England, includes the “…proper and safe management of medicines…” (required under the The Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 - SI 2014/2936 r.12(2)(g)) as part of the medicines optimisation domain of their single assessment framework. Where the CQC inspects services that include operating departments and/or theatres, the safe and secure use of anaesthetics would form part of that assurance, with any concerns raised with the trust and NHS England as necessary.\\n\\nNHS England will continue to explore and support improvements in the controlled, authorised and auditable access to medicines.\\n\\nWith regard to your specific concerns about how Sevoflurane is stored and monitored at Cannock Chase Hospital, I note that you have also addressed your Report to the hospital and refer you to their response on these issues. NHS England will also consider the hospital’s response and any actions arising from this in due course.\\n\\nI would also like to provide further assurances on the national NHS England work taking place around the Reports to Prevent Future Deaths. All reports received are discussed by the Regulation 28 Working Group, comprising Regional Medical Directors, and other clinical and quality colleagues from across the regions. This ensures that key learnings and insights around events, such as the sad death of Gemma, are shared across the NHS at both a national and regional level and helps us to pay close attention to any emerging trends that may require further review and action.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/daniel-pinkney-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0609', recipients=['Department of Transport', 'Driver Vehicle Standards Agency', 'Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='There is a need for greater awareness among road users about the phenomenon of aquaplaning and the importance of reducing speed when surface water is present.'), ConcernItem(concern='Road users should have basic knowledge about braking and steering techniques to manage a vehicle experiencing aquaplaning.'), ConcernItem(concern='The Highway Code currently does not address the issue of aquaplaning, which may leave road users uninformed about this risk.')]), responses=['I am deeply saddened by the circumstances of Daniel Pinkney’s death, and I would like to extend my condolences to his family. I am determined that we learn from tragedies like this and that we take action to reduce those killed and injured on our roads. I want to assure you that the Government treats road safety with the utmost seriousness. Whilst UK roads are among the safest in the world, there is no room for complacency and I have carefully considered your report and its recommendations. You recommended updating the Highway Code to raise awareness about aquaplaning. You also mentioned the importance of reducing speed when surface water is present, and basic knowledge about braking and steering. While there is no specific mention of aquaplaning in The Highway Code. Rules 117 to 126 cover control of the vehicle. Rules 119 to 121 mention skidding, ABS and brakes affected by water. Rule 125 offers guidance on reducing speed, including when the road layout or condition presents hazards and weather conditions make it safer to do so. Rule 227 (Wet Weather) advises what action should be taken if steering becomes unresponsive, likely due to water preventing the tyres from gripping the road, and recommends that drivers ease off the accelerator and slow down gradually. As such, we consider that appropriate guidance is in place in the current text of the Highway Code. The Highway Code has historically undergone a major revision approximately every ten years and we currently have no plans to carry out a major revision. When we carry out the next revision to the Code, we will as usual undertake a consultation on proposed changes and this would offer the appropriate opportunity to consider including advice on aquaplaning. Additionally, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) already provides advice to drivers on aquaplaning. The DVSA’s driving tests are designed to make sure new drivers have the skills they will need to help them through a lifetime of safe driving. The DVSA also continues to encourage experienced drivers to read the Highway Code to refresh their road safety knowledge and check if there are changes. The Highway Code and the DVSA Guide to Driving; the Essential Skills (DES) are both source material for the car theory test. DES is a source that goes into more detail about driving on standing water (aquaplaning) which can be purchased by candidates and this allows the DVSA to ask questions in the theory test. The DVSA produces a number of guidance documents to assist all drivers and riders on Great Britain’s roads. The DVSA publishes this advice for all drivers, not just for learners. Further free information about driving in standing water can be found in their following publications: Driving conditions (skills 24 to 26) - Ready to Pass?: https://readytopass.campaign.gov.uk/driving-skills/driving-conditions/ There are numerous sections on recognising and handling risks when operating a motorbike in deep water or rainy conditions, as well as when operating a heavy-goods vehicle and driving a car, at https://www.safedrivingforlife.info/advice/ The DVSA is aware of the importance of reminding drivers of their road safety responsibilities. The agency regularly posts articles on social media platforms, and this month the DVSA also plans to launch and promote a winter driving e-learning course through www.safedrivingforlife.info You also mentioned blockage of drainage gulleys as a factor in the collision. Local highway authorities have a duty under Section 41 of the Highways Act 1980 to maintain the public highway network in their area. The Act does not set out specific standards of maintenance, as it is for each individual local highway authority to assess which parts of its network need repair and what standards should be applied, based on its local knowledge and circumstances. DfT strongly advocates a risk-based whole lifecycle asset management approach to local authority highways maintenance programmes. This considers all parts of the highway network, such as bridges, cycleways, drainage gullies, and lighting columns – and not just the fixing of potholes. It is up to the respective highway authority how best to spend this funding to fulfil their statutory duty under Section 41 of the Highways Act 1980. Further information and best practice on the on the importance of ensuring adequate drainage and tackling surface water is available from the UK Roads Leadership Group website: Guidance on the management of highway drainage assets within the Code of Practice for Well Managed Highways. We will continue to work with stakeholders to amplify road safety messages and will encourage them to do this with aquaplaning where appropriate. This Government takes road safety very seriously, and we are committed to reducing the numbers of those killed and injured on our roads.

NHS England has not dealt with this particular concern within this response.\\n\\nBackground information about NHS Pathways Clinical Decision Support System\\n\\nThe NHS Pathways Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is a triage product that is used to support Call Handlers (Health Advisors) in Urgent and Emergency services. The product is owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and is manufactured and managed by the Transformation Directorate of NHS England. It is used in NHS 111 and over half of 999 ambulance services. It is the triage product used by North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), who received Simon’s 999 call.\\n\\nNHS Pathways supports the remote assessment of over 25 million calls a year. It is embedded within host systems in NHS 111 and 999 ambulance providers where it interacts with other technology products to support the assessment, sorting and onward management of calls received by those services.\\n\\nCalls to services using the NHS Pathways triage product are managed by specially trained non-clinical health advisors and clinicians. Their training is specific to the NHS Pathways product, and this enables them to use the information provided by callers to pass cases to suitable services, based on the patient’s health needs at the time of the call.\\n\\nThe NHS Pathways triage product is built to progress through a clinical hierarchy of urgency. This means that life-threatening symptoms or problems are assessed first, and less urgent symptoms or problems are assessed sequentially thereafter. The endpoint of an assessment is reached when a clinically significant factor cannot be ruled out and so a “disposition” is reached. Dispositions range from an emergency ambulance to self-care.\\n\\nClinical Governance of NHS Pathways\\n\\nThe safety of the clinical triage process endpoints resulting from an NHS 111 or 999 assessment using NHS Pathways is overseen by the National Clinical Assurance Group (NCAG), an independent intercollegiate group hosted by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC). Alongside this independent oversight, NHS Pathways ensures its clinical content and assessment protocols are consistent with the latest advice from respected bodies that provide evidence and guidance for clinical practice in the UK. This includes latest guidelines from:-\\n\\na. NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence);\\nb. The UK Resuscitation Council; and\\nc. The UK Sepsis Trust.\\n\\nWording of scripts\\n\\nIn Simon’s case, an emergency ambulance response (Category 3) was generated and the wording in relation to that disposition is that an ambulance ‘is being arranged’. The wording which Health Advisors (HAs) are expected to convey is shown below:\\n\\nEmergency Ambulance Closure, Breathlessness\\n\\nAn emergency ambulance is being arranged.\\n\\nFollowing the disposition, HA’s are trained to give care advice and worsening advice presented by the system as shown below. This includes any symptom specific advice, and advice about what to do should the situation change. This is an essential risk management technique, as it is vital that callers know what to do should the situation worsen, change or if they have any other concerns or develop new symptoms. Worsening advice should be used in its entirety as this has been specifically designed to address this range of situations.\\n\\nThe timelines within which an ambulance response should be provided vary according to the urgency of the call. Ambulance response standards and ambulance quality indicators are the nationally agreed timeframes for ambulances to arrive at the patient’s location following a call passed to the ambulance service. Further information can be found at https://www.england.nhs.uk/urgent-emergency-care/arp\\n\\nAll NHS Pathways ambulance response disposition codes are ratified by the Clinical Coding Reference Group (CCRG), the National Ambulance Services Medical Directors (NASMeD) and Emergency Call Prioritisation Advisory Group (ECPAG). NASMeD is an advisory group consisting of medical director representatives from all ambulance services in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland who endorse the categorisation of ambulance codes.\\n\\nThe purpose of ECPAG is to advise NHS England and the Department of Health & Social Care (DHSC) on issues of ambulance call prioritisation. Its principal remit is to recommend which disposition codes should be mapped to which ambulance responses. The group consists of membership from the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE), CCRG, NHS England, NHS Pathways, the National Ambulance Commissioning Network (NACN), NASMeD and Ambulance Heads of Control.\\n\\nThe information given to callers about ambulance dispatch is aligned with the ambulance response standards, and NHS Pathways is not designed to take account of operational delays as these can be very variable and do not represent the recommended clinical disposition.\\n\\nIn order to support ambulance providers to manage their available resources, NHS England has issued a national directive, requiring providers to undertake clinical validation of Category 3 and Category 4 ambulance responses within both NHS 111 and 999 services. This involves validation of the disposition by a clinician (arranged locally), which can result in a different disposition being subsequently reached. The information captured in NHS Pathways may allow a clinician to re-categorise the call without direct contact with the patient. The Ambulance Trust’s Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system, rather than NHS Pathways, is used to manage the validation process. It is a requirement that the CAD must be able to provide appropriate exit scripts for Category 3 / Category 4 codes or dispositions. The wording of the exit scripts is for local determination.\\n\\nIn addition, where there is high demand on a service, providers are permitted and do implement their own scripts when it comes to the delivery of dispositions to try and manage expectations.\\n\\nCancellation of ambulances\\n\\nIn Simon’s case, the Health Advisor followed the training provided by NHS Pathways in delivering the disposition and completing the relevant call.\\n\\nSimon was subsequently spoken to by a clinician within the Greater Manchester Clinical Assessment Service, who would have cancelled the ambulance. This validation and cancellation of an ambulance is not within the remit of the NHS Pathways system, and no data is provided back to NHS Pathways or the provider as to the changing of a disposition. Should the Coroner wish to investigate this further, he would be best placed contacting the Greater Manchester Clinical Assessment Service.\\n\\nThe NHS 111 and 999 services have Standard Operating Procedures in place to manage this. These are determined locally and are not mandated nationally.\\n\\nI would also like to provide further assurances on the national NHS England work taking place around the Reports to Prevent Future Deaths. All reports received are discussed by the Regulation 28 Working Group, comprising Regional Medical Directors, and other clinical and quality colleagues from across the regions. This ensures that key learnings and insights around events, such as the sad death of Simon, are shared across the NHS at both a national and regional level and helps us to pay close attention to any emerging trends that may require further review and action.', 'Firstly, I would like to say how saddened I was to read of the circumstances of Mr Boyd’s death, and I offer my sincere condolences to his family and loved ones. The circumstances your report describes are very concerning and I am grateful to you for bringing these matters to my attention.\\n\\nYour report raises concerns about ambulance response times and the script used by call handlers. In preparing this response, my officials have made enquiries with NHS England to ensure we adequately address your concerns. I understand NHS England are writing to you regarding the specific concerns you have raised on the current wording used in the NHS Pathways script by call handers.\\n\\nThis Government recognises that in recent years, ambulance response time performance has been below the high standards that patients should expect. That is why this Government has committed to supporting the National Health Service to improve performance, including ambulance services achieving the safe operational response times standards set out in the NHS Constitution.\\n\\nOn 5 December 2024 the Government published the Plan for Change, which set out clear milestones in five national missions that set the mandate for the direction of change, including building an NHS that is fit for the future. The Plan for Change is available here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6751af4719e0c816d18d1df3/Plan_for_Change.pdf\\n\\nThe Government has been honest about the challenges facing the NHS and it is serious about tackling the issues, however we must be clear that there are no quick fixes. We are determined to turn things around through providing investment and implementing reforms.\\n\\nThat is why the Chancellor announced £25.6 billion of additional healthcare funding over the next two years covering 2024-2026. In Spring 2025, to accompany this additional investment the Government will publish its 10-Year Health Plan, that will set out the radical reforms for the NHS so it can tackle the problems of today and tomorrow.\\n\\nThe 10 Year Health Plan will focus on ensuring three big reform shifts in the way our health services deliver care. First, from ‘hospital to community’ to bring care closer to where people live. Second, from ‘analogue to digital’ with new technologies and digital approaches to modernise the NHS, and third from ‘sickness to prevention’ so people spend less time with ill-health by preventing illnesses before they happen. The reforms will support putting the NHS on a sustainable footing for the future.\\n\\nIn the short-term, by this Spring we will set out the lessons learned from this winter and the improvements that we will put in place to improve urgent and emergency care ahead of next winter.\\n\\nI hope this response is helpful.

I am the Director of Investment Planning at TfL.\\n\\nI am personally very sorry to hear of the tragic death of Mr Terrence Gillard and wish to express my sincere condolences and those of Transport for London (TfL) to Mr Gillard’s family and friends.\\n\\nOn 5 November 2024, the Coroner issued a Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) report raising matters of concern addressed to TfL, the London Borough of Hounslow (LBH) and the Department for Transport (DfT). Please accept this letter as TfL’s response to the PFD report.\\n\\nThis letter outlines the actions already taken and those that we intend to take to provide a safer pedestrian crossing across the A4 Great West Road (A4) at its junction with Jersey Road in Hounslow.\\n\\nResponsibility for managing London’s road network is shared between TfL, Highways England, and the 32 London boroughs, plus the City of London. TfL is the Highway and Traffic Authority for Greater London Authority Roads which is also referred to as the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). TfL is responsible for road maintenance, traffic signs, traffic control systems, road safety and traffic reduction on the TLRN.\\n\\nHighways England manages the national motorway network, including the M25, M1, M4 and M11. The London boroughs are responsible for the remaining roads within their boundaries.\\n\\nTfL is the highway authority for the A4 in Hounslow. LBH is the highway authority for Jersey Road which forms a junction with the A4. We have had discussions with LBH regarding our joint approach to improve the A4, including pedestrian safety in this area.\\n\\nThe A4 was designed and constructed in the 1920s and has seen modifications to its operation since. As London has grown, the mix of development alongside the A4 has changed from that of historic estates (such as Osterley Park) and industrial uses to that of more predominantly residential and office buildings. TfL took over responsibility for the A4 as the responsible highway authority in 2000 when TfL was created.\\n\\nThe A4 is a busy and strategically important transport corridor from the West of the country into London, carrying in excess of 27,000 vehicles a day. It is a dual carriageway typically of six lanes, increasing to seven lanes at this location to accommodate a right turn lane into Jersey Road south (towards Hounslow). At the time of the tragic incident involving Mr Gillard, the speed limit was 40mph; it is now 30mph.\\n\\nRoad safety, particularly the reduction of personal injuries, is core to our strategic aims at TfL. We actively seek to reduce collisions across the whole of London with initiatives detailed in the Mayor’s Transport Strategy (March 2018) and the Vision Zero Action Plan (July 2018). These policy documents set our vision to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries by 2041, as well as reduce the road danger on our road network. These documents outline the important first stages in a wide-ranging programme of actions that we, as an organisation, are taking now and over the coming years. To help achieve these aims we work closely with the London Boroughs and the Metropolitan Police Service to make London’s roads safer.\\n\\nIt is our standard practice, and part of our wider commitment to Vision Zero, to organise a visit to the site of every fatal incident that occurs on TfL’s road network. The purpose of the visit is to help us understand any factors that may have been relevant to the incident occurring. We also look for any immediate concerns which may require urgent remedial work, e.g. poor condition of the road. In this case, the initial site visit by TfL took place on 27 September 2022, no immediate concerns were flagged. Representatives from TfL and LBH also met with Mr Gillard’s family and [redacted] MP in March 2023.\\n\\nWe undertook a further site visit on 14 September 2023 once we had received more detailed information from the Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit.\\n\\nWe also undertook a more in-depth desktop study of the wider collision history in the area along with our road risk priority ranked junctions dataset, and determined that it was appropriate to undertake a review of the junction with a view to providing formal crossings at this location.\\n\\nIn the three years up to 31 July 2024, there were six collisions within a 50m radius of the A4 junction with Jersey Road. The six collisions involved seven casualties. Of these, one collision involved the serious injury of a pedestrian and the another involved the serious injury of a rider of an unknown vehicle type. Of the slight injuries, two casualties involved drivers of cars, one involved a pedal cyclist and one involved a motorcyclist. One was tragically fatal (the incident involving Mr Gillard).\\n\\nAs previously advised at the inquest, we are developing a formal crossing proposal at this location. The proposals are as follows:\\n\\n• A signalised crossing facility for pedestrians and cyclists across the A4;\\n• A signalised crossing facility for pedestrians and cyclists across Jersey Road (South);\\n• A signalised crossing facility for pedestrians and cyclists across Jersey Road (North); and\\n• Amendments to the highway layout on the A4, Jersey Road and Jersey Parade to facilitate the above crossings.\\n\\nAs my colleague [redacted] advised during the inquest, it is likely that delivery of the scheme will take place in 2026, to enable time for the completion of traffic modelling, public engagement, concept and detailed design and contractor mobilisation (including relocating any utility services that are required to be moved by statutory undertakers as part of scheme delivery).\\n\\nThere are a number of governance steps, known as stage gates, that we need to work through before a scheme can be confirmed for implementation. We are currently at Stage 2 (Option Selection), which is where we have designs for the improvement works which we are assessing in more detail. We are undertaking further detailed traffic modelling for which further traffic data collection is required from nearby junctions along the A4. These traffic surveys are planned to take place in early January 2025 so that this data can be used for traffic modelling early in Spring 2025, in order to analyse the impact any proposals may have on the traffic flow. Once we have certainty that the designs are viable, we will proceed to Stage 3 (Concept Design), where we will refine the design and ensure that it can be constructed as planned. This is also the point at which we start to estimate the cost of the works and confirm the budget required to deliver the crossing.\\n\\nTfL is doing all it can to expedite this process safely, we undertake traffic modelling to ensure that any changes are safe for all road users, that the designs are safe and work in practice. Public engagement is essential so that we can explain the proposals to local residents and the rationale behind them. It also provides an opportunity for the public to raise any concerns for our consideration.\\n\\nLBH have already indicated that they are supportive of our plans. We will work with the LBH to enter into agreements to undertake any minor works on their road network that may be required to facilitate delivery of the scheme.\\n\\nSubject to confirmation that the scheme is deliverable, TfL will monitor the operation and performance of these new crossings post-implementation for a period of at least 48 months. This will include a post-construction road safety audit and a review of collisions since the crossing has been introduced.\\n\\nI now turn to the matters of concern noted in your report. I provide clarity on some of the items raised:\\n\\na. You note that the pedestrian crossing area spans across a dual carriageway subject to a speed limit of 40mph. At the time of the tragic incident involving Mr Gillard this was the speed limit. On 18 March 2024 a traffic order came into force to reduce the speed limit from 40mph to 30mph as part of our Lowering Speed Limits Programme.\\n\\nb. You have observed that the crossing point currently leads pedestrians into a cycle lane. We are working on new designs that propose to make the area around the crossing points a “shared space” to encourage cyclists and pedestrians to be respectful of each other’s needs, the proposals are subject to engagement. There will be signage installed advising users that this is a shared space for pedestrians and cyclists.\\n\\nc. You note that at no point during the normal use of the traffic light-controlled junction does traffic cease to flow at the marked crossing area, making it difficult for pedestrians to judge when and from where the next vehicle would approach. This means that pedestrians will need to use their own judgment as to when it is safe to cross this road without the aid of pedestrian crossing lights. For clarity, vehicles are held at the stop lines at different times of the operation of the traffic signals. This is particularly the case when walking from the northern pavement to the traffic islands. The difficulty is predominantly when crossing between the traffic islands and the southern pavement. This is where there is less time to cross as the only time traffic ceases to flow is during a period known as the “intergreen” – when one traffic movement is ceasing and another one is starting in response to a change in the traffic signals. We are seeking to address this and propose that the new pedestrian crossing design holds traffic on the A4 to allow the pedestrians time to cross the road. The crossing will include the provision of a push button unit, rotating cone (for visually impaired people) and a green person signal.\\n\\nd. With regards to other collisions involving pedestrians and moving vehicles, we have undertaken a thorough review of the nearby collisions based on the historic collision data and will consider any other changes to the highway layout which may reduce collision risk in addition to changes to the crossing itself. For example, we are also proposing changes to the service road next to the crossing to make it easier for pedestrians and cyclists to access the crossing.\\n\\ne. Finally, I turn to your concern that the implementation of TfL’s plans to redesign the pedestrian crossing will not be until 2026 and it remains subject to the consent of the DfT and LBH, the outcome of any public consultation as well as funding considerations. I explain above the steps which must be undertaken, and the timings involved with delivering appropriate and safe improvement works. In relation to consent from LBH, this is only necessary in relation to any minor works on their road network that may be required to facilitate delivery of the wider scheme. In addition, there is no requirement for consent or approvals to be obtained from the DfT. As advised by [redacted] in evidence at the inquest, proposed improvement schemes of this scale and complexity can often take up to five years to implement due to the stages that must be completed to ensure the proposed works are properly designed, they are safe and are viable. We are aiming for these proposed improvement works to be implemented in three years, we have set out above the progress we have made.\\n\\nInterim temporary measures\\n\\nIn the short term and further to our update to you dated 31 October 2024, it is our intention to place temporary customer information signage that warn pedestrians to take care when crossing the road at this junction. This is intended as a temporary step until a permanent crossing scheme can be implemented. Our supplier is working towards implementing within the timeframe that we advised previously, but due constraints with the wider supply chain and the need for further technical review, they will not be in place until January 2025.\\n\\nWe would be happy to provide you with an update in respect of the timings for implementing the scheme, as well as copies of pictures of the customer information once this has been placed at the junction.', \"I write on behalf of the London Borough of Hounslow about the inquest of Terence William Gillard which took place on 30th September 2024 at West London Coroner's Court.

Please accept this letter as LBH's response to the PFD report.\\n\\nThis letter outlines the actions taken to date and those we intend to take to ensure a safer pedestrian crossing across the A4 Great West Road (A4) at its junction with Jersey Road in Hounslow.\\n\\nLBH's responsibility and the location of of the incident\\n\\nThe incident took place on A4 which is part of the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN) and TfL is the Highways and Traffic Authority for roads that falls under this network. Similarly, TfL is responsible for road maintenance, traffic signs, traffic signals and road safety of TLRN. LBH is the Highway Authority for Jersey Road which forms a junction with the A4.\\n\\nActions taken by LBH\\n\\nFollowing the incident, we have had a number of discussions and site meetings with TfL to improve traffic conditions in the A4 especially for the vulnerable road users. We understand that TfL has undertaken a detailed study of the collision data in the area and is now reviewing the junction with a view to provide a formal pedestrian crossing facility at this location.\\n\\nThe proposals being considered are amending the existing design to accommodate improvements as follows.\\n\\n- a signal-controlled crossing for pedestrian and cyclists across the A4,\\n\\n- A signal-controlled crossing for pedestrian and cyclists across Jersey Road (South and North)\\n\\nThe above proposal once designed by TfL will be consulted on with us and we will ensure that the new design is not only technically sound but also aligns with the local users' needs. We expect these proposals to by finalised by TfL in 2025-26 with view to construct them in 2026-27. We will continue to work with TfL and all other stakeholders to secure a priority implementation of these important safety measures.\\n\\nWe are also working with TfL to facilitate some interim temporary measures such as additional signs to warn pedestrians to take care when crossing the road at this location.\", \"I am writing regarding your concern about the pedestrian crossing on the A4 Great West Road, near the junction with Jersey Road, in Hounslow, West London. I note your concerns about the safety of this crossing.\\n\\nThe highway authority, in this case Transport for London (TfL), is responsible for how traffic is managed on its roads. This includes the design and maintenance of traffic light junctions and any associated pedestrian crossings. While the Department for Transport issues guidance to highway authorities, the Department does not oversee or consent to traffic schemes of this nature.\\n\\nTransport for London has a duty under Section 122 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, to exercise its functions under the Act so as to secure the expeditious, convenient, and safe movement of vehicular and other traffic, including pedestrians, so far as practicable having regard to various matters including the amenity of the area through which the road runs.\\n\\nTraffic signals, including the signs and road markings required to create a junction and associated pedestrian facilities, are prescribed in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 (TSRGD). Highway authorities do not need Departmental consent to place the signs within this legislation on their roads. We provide good practice advice on the design of traffic signals, including pedestrian crossings and pedestrian facilities at junctions, in Chapter 6 of the Traffic Signs Manual, which is available free to download from our website.\\n\\nThe Regulation 28 report said that you had received evidence from TfL of existing plans to re-design this pedestrian crossing, and TfL had said this was subject to the consent of the Department for Transport, the London Borough of Hounslow, public consultation, as well as funding considerations.\\n\\nI am not aware of any consents required from the Department to enable TfL to make changes to this site. I understand my officials have been in contact with TfL and it has confirmed that the new crossing designs are in TfL and the Borough's gift to implement, subject to funding and public consultation, and no DfT involvement is required.\\n\\nThe Secretary of State has powers under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to specially authorise signs not within TSRGD. A local authority may apply to the Department for authorisation, if it feels there is a specific local need not met by TSRGD. However, we have not received any such applications from TfL in relation to this site.\\n\\nOn the issue of funding, the Government engages regularly with TfL to understand its investment plans and funding requirements. The Government announced \\x1630 million capital funding in December 2023, and a further \\x16485 million for the coming 2025/26 financial year at the Budget, for TfL\\x19s major capital projects. This is in addition to almost \\x162.2 billion of business rates for transport retained by TfL in 2024/25. The Mayor of London and TfL consider, prioritise and approve its investment decisions. The re-design of the pedestrian crossing would be funded by TfL from revenue sources outside the Department\\x19s funding.\\n\\nI hope you will understand why I consider that the Department does not need to take any action regarding this incident.

I would like to express my sincere condolences to Mrs Lambert’s family and loved ones.\\n\\nWe have reflected on the circumstances surrounding her death and senior clinical advisers within our patient safety team have reviewed the concerns raised in your report.\\n\\nI understand that the inquest was advised that Mrs Lambert had become very immobile since her fall. The inquest was also advised that there was no national guidance that would assist clinicians in primary care in assessing whether they should consider prolonging the course of anticoagulation prescribed in secondary care to reduce the ongoing risk of elderly immobile patients such as Mrs Lambert developing a fatal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the community.\\n\\nIn the circumstances outlined in your report we believe that an assessment of the venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk, balanced against the prophylaxis risk, should have been made at discharge. Although our VTE guideline [NG89] does not give advice on starting VTE prophylaxis de novo in the community, it does give advice on starting and continuing pharmacological VTE prophylaxis after surgery (recommendation 1.11) and having a clear discharge plan. Decisions on prophylaxis should be driven by the needs of the individual, balancing the person's individual risk of VTE against their risk of bleeding when deciding whether to offer pharmacological thromboprophylaxis to surgical and trauma patients (recommendation 1.1.6).\\n\\nIf Mrs Lambert was not fully mobile on discharge, there is an expectation that this would be considered in an assessment as part of the discharge plan, which might result in continued VTE prophylaxis (either pharmacological or mechanical) as is recommended in our guidance.\\n\\nBoth pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis have well recognised side effects (including a higher risk of intra and extracranial bleeding, higher drug costs and risks of renal impairment especially in elderly patients with poor renal function). We therefore recommend that a risk assessment should be made in conjunction with the patient before they are prescribed (recommendation 1.2.2) and on discharge (recommendations 1.2.4 and 1.2.5).\\n\\nIt is difficult to provide more specific commentary without detailed information about Mrs Lambert’s personal clinical circumstances, however our guidance does recommend in several places the use of anti-embolism stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression, which should be continued until the person no longer has significantly reduced mobility relative to their normal or anticipated mobility.\\n\\nI can confirm that we will review our guidance on stopping and starting VTE prophylaxis to see if an update is warranted. The potential scope of this work is to be confirmed but it may cover the management of people with immobility, if there is sufficient good quality evidence on which to base recommendations.\\n\\nPlease do let me know if you require any further information and again, I offer my sincerest condolences to Mrs Lambert’s family.\"]), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/james-boland-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0599', recipients=['The Home Secretary'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern=\"Maintaining ketamine's classification as a class B drug may encourage use under the false impression that it is less harmful than class A drugs.\"), ConcernItem(concern='Ketamine use causes significant long-term health problems, including urological and liver damage, which can be fatal.'), ConcernItem(concern='There is a significant increase in illicit ketamine use leading to a rise in potentially fatal health problems that users often do not understand until irreversible damage occurs.')]), responses=['Thank you for your Regulation 28: Prevention of Future Deaths report of 5 November to the Home Secretary about the death of Mr James Patrick Boland, which was linked to chronic ketamine use.

I am replying as the Minister of State for Policing, Fire and Crime Prevention.\\n\\nFirstly, any death related to drugs is a tragedy, and I was very sorry to read about the circumstances of Mr Boland’s death.\\n\\nThe inquest found that Mr Boland had switched from using cocaine, which is controlled under Class A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (“the 1971 Act”), to ketamine, a Class B under the 1971 Act, because he thought that the classification of ketamine meant that it was less harmful. You are concerned that maintaining ketamine’s classification is likely to encourage others to start or continue to use the drug, under the false impression that it is safer than drugs controlled under Class A.\\n\\nKetamine is controlled as a Class B drug under the 1971 Act. The maximum penalty for supply and production is up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. The maximum penalty for possession is up to 5 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. These controls are intended to discourage the use of drugs and contribute, along with other measures, to restrict misuse.\\n\\nMinisters are subject to a statutory duty to consider advice provided by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), an independent scientific advisory body, before making changes to drugs legislation. Ketamine was moved from Class C to Class B under the 1971 Act in 2014, in accordance with advice provided by the ACMD. Their recommendation was based on evidence of ketamine’s potential for harm at that time. The ACMD stated that “although there is limited evidence of ketamine misuse causing social harm, evidence of physical harm (mainly chronic bladder toxicity but also an increase in acute toxicity) has increased”.

The Probation Service manages a three-tier structure of temporary accommodation known as the Community Accommodation Service (CAS): CAS1 (accommodation with a public protection focus for higher-risk offenders, known as Approved Premises), CAS2 (low to medium risk offenders on Home Detention Curfew or bail) and CAS3 (up to 12 weeks basic accommodation for prison leavers at risk of homelessness).\\n\\nHomelessness Prevention Teams are embedded in all probation regions and play a significant role in developing and leading the regional probation response to reducing homelessness for People on Probation, transitioning from custody to the community. They are tasked to choreograph local activity between the Probation Service and a range of strategic partners, including Local Authorities, Housing Providers, Police, Health, Strategic Housing Specialists (SHS), CRS providers and the Voluntary/Community Sector. This joint working helps to embed and expand housing options for prison leavers.\\n\\nAcross our prisons 49 full time equivalent Strategic Housing Specialists (SHS) operate working to clusters of geographically close prisons across England and Wales. Their key responsibilities include Identifying, developing, and delivering a range of solutions that remove barriers to accommodation, including solutions to logistical barriers. They develop and deliver training products to upskill prison staff on accommodation pathways and act as subject matter experts on housing and homelessness for prison senior leaders and regional prison structures. They work in partnership to improve regional responses to homelessness amongst prison leavers and lead Local Authority Pre-Release Homelessness Panels which are multi-agency meetings that aim to identify the most appropriate accommodation pathway for individuals who would otherwise be homeless. In turn, this supports other areas of resettlement work such as ensuring the continuation of healthcare or securing employment in the correct area.\\n\\nAdditionally Commissioned Rehabilitative Service (CRS) provision exists in all regions of England and Wales. Providers have specialist knowledge to give support in obtaining accommodation, including securing social or supported housing, securing a tenancy in the private rented sector, help to sustain existing accommodation and help to close down a tenancy at the start of a long sentence. Accommodation CRS provision for women is part of the women's holistic CRS offer and not accessed via the region’s CRS Accommodation provider (for men) but from the CRS Women’s Services contract provider.\\n\\nThere are currently 2339 Approved Premises bed placements across England and Wales. The Approved Premises Expansion programme concluded in March 2023, delivering 169 additional spaces, 115 male and 54 female. This has enabled us to have the capacity for those presenting the very highest risks, to stay in Approved Premises (AP) for up to 12 months. We have also expanded provision for women by over 30%, increasing the opportunities for women to have a place in an AP after release, as part of a community order or as a bail placement. The closure report for the expansion project concluded that there are now an additional 40 bed space placements in the Southwest South-Central Area.\\n\\nCAS2 provides suitable gender specific accommodation for Bailees and prisoners eligible for Home Detention Curfew (HDC), who might be remanded or not released due to lack of suitable accommodation. Additionally, they provide accommodation in some circumstances for those who lose their accommodation whilst subject to licence in the community, all individual placements receive weekly support sessions to help ensure successful completion of their residency. CAS2 currently has c850 bed spaces in over 275 properties across England and Wales. This is an increase from 550 at the commencement of the current contract in October 2022. CAS2 continues to increase capacity, working towards 1350 spaces in the next year.\\n\\nCAS3 provides transitional accommodation for up to 84 nights for prison leavers and those moving on from CAS1 and CAS2, subject to probation supervision who would otherwise be homeless, with basic floating support to move on into settled accommodation. All prison leavers who are at risk of being released from prison homeless and will be subject to probation supervision upon release, will be offered accommodation through our CAS3 provision; however, this is a consent-based arrangement and not all prison leavers will accept. The service is delivered by regional Homelessness Prevention Teams working in collaboration with contracted accommodation suppliers in 10 probation regions, and via grant funded arrangements in partnership with Local Authorities in Greater Manchester and Wales.\\n\\nCAS3 supported over 6,000 people last year (April 2023-March 2024) and the service which currently provides 2603 bedspaces is expanding to support more people at risk of homelessness each year.\\n\\nThis provision provides a critical stabilising environment for people on release from prison from which they can address other aspects of their behaviour linked to their risk of re-offending.\\n\\nIn the case of prison leavers not placed in Approved Premises, who are at risk of homelessness, it is essential that services work together to fulfil their respective roles so that risk is effectively identified and appropriate accommodation is provided.\\n\\nLocal Authorities have statutory duties to assist people who are homeless or threatened with homelessness. They work in partnership with HMPPS to ensure those placed in CAS temporary accommodation have the move-on accommodation which is appropriate to any identified risks.\\n\\nIn 2021 MHCLG, working closely with MoJ, launched the Accommodation for Ex Offenders (AfEO) scheme, which provides funding to local authorities to support ex-offenders to move to settled accommodation in the private rented sector. Since 2021, approximately thirty three million pounds has been awarded to local authorities for this purpose and 5,988 individuals have been supported to access tenancies.\\n\\nEvidence shows that these programmes have enabled occupants to access and remain in accommodation. However, more action is needed to ensure all prison leavers are able to access accommodation. MoJ and MHCLG are continuing to work closely together to identify and implement what is needed.\\n\\nThis work is part of cross-government work led by the Deputy Prime Minister to end all forms of homelessness. The Deputy Prime Minister is chairing a dedicated Inter-Ministerial Group which brings together ministers from across government to develop a long term strategy, which will include action to avoid risk of homelessness for individuals leaving institutions, including prison. It is expected that the strategy will be published next year following the conclusion of the next spending review. In the meantime, as announced at budget, funding for homelessness services is increasing next year by £233 million. This includes support for areas to maintain and develop pathways for prison leavers into settled accommodation. The MHCLG Homelessness Advice and Support Team will continue to work with local authorities to promote a partnership approach to the statutory referral mechanism and improve quality of information sharing to promote better assessments and convening events to share best practice.\\n\\nThe Minister of State for Prisons, Probation and Reducing Reoffending, Lord James Timpson, will lead on driving forward the Department’s priority to reduce the number of people leaving prison homeless and ensuring that there is appropriate accommodation to support those offenders who have higher support needs.\\n\\nThank you again for bringing your concerns to our attention. I trust that this response provides assurance that action is being taken to address this matter.\"]), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/darren-hope-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0597', recipients=['The Chief Executive Officer of the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='Section 17 leave conditions may not always be thoroughly reviewed or clarified before a service user is signed out for leave, risking unaddressed discrepancies that could affect safety and appropriateness of unescorted leave.'), ConcernItem(concern='There may be a lack of accessible or reliable means for service users on unescorted leave to contact the facility if they encounter difficulties, potentially limiting their ability to seek support.'), ConcernItem(concern='The reporting system may have limitations in identifying and addressing substantive issues impacting patient safety, risking that critical concerns are overlooked and reducing effectiveness in preventing future incidents.')]), responses=[\"I am writing to you in response to the Regulation 28 Prevention of Future Death (PFD) report, which followed the inquest for Mr Darren Hope.\\n\\nThank you for the report. I do understand the need to reflect on learning from events in healthcare, and the PFD system is one way of supporting the sharing of learning activity.\\n\\nThe three concerns that you have raised with the Trust are repeated below for ease of reference:\\n\\n\\x183 Concern 1: Section 17 leave conditions may not always be thoroughly reviewed or clarified before a service user is signed out for leave. This lack of verification can lead to unaddressed discrepancies, which may impact the safety and appropriateness of unescorted leave.\\n\\x183 Concern 2: There may be a lack of accessible or reliable means for service users on unescorted leave to contact the facility if they encounter difficulties. This could impact their ability to seek support or assistance when needed.\\n\\x183 Concern 3: There may be limitations in the reporting system\\x19s ability to identify and address substantive issues that directly impact patient safety. If critical concerns are overlooked, there is a risk that valuable insights for preventing future incidents may be missed, reducing the system's effectiveness in promoting long-term safety improvements.\\n\\nFrom talking with my colleagues involved in the case and the inquest, some of the response I am setting out below has already been shared as part of the inquest, but I have also reflected on additional work that we have completed or are planning to complete in order that a comprehensive response is provided to you.\\n\\nResponse to Concern 1:\\nThe Trust acknowledges that in respect of Mr Hope being signed out of the ward, on leave on 3 July 2023, the correct process was not carried out in line with the Trust\\x19s Section 17 Leave Policy in that ward staff had not verified the Section 17 leave form was correct.\\n\\nSupporting safe and effective Section 17 leave is a core issue within our Mental Health Directorate and it is worth appraising you of the focussed work that we have been undertaking.\\n\\nIn January 2021, a cross directorate approach was undertaken to review and update the Section 17 Leave Policy taking into account staff views. The task and finish group were made up of a mix of professionals from both acute and community services including Nursing Staff, Ward Managers, Matrons, Psychiatrists, Psychologists, AHPs and Mental Health Act leads. I have set out the updates to the Section 17 Policy at appendix one. Since the update of the Section 17 Leave Policy, clear guidance is provided on the Trust intranet in the form of a section 17 toolkit which has a Step-by-step guidance to facilitating Section 17 agreed leave of absence.\\n\\nThe guidance is aimed at promoting good practice and to ensure Section 17 and agreed absence from the ward for detained patients, is in line with the Trust\\x19s Section 17 Leave Policy and the MHA Code of Practice. Other elements of the toolkit include:\\n\\x183 Accompanied Leave Checklist, which is a handover document which is completed with the person accompanying the patient.\\n\\x183 A blank copy of the updated Leave of Absence (Section 17) form.\\n\\x183 A staff briefing poster of the new Section 17 leave Policy.\\n\\x183 Powerpoint teaching presentation of Step-by-step guidance to facilitating Section 17 agreed leave of absence for staff.\\n\\nThe work which has been done around improving contingency planning, as set out in oral evidence by [redacted], Associate Director of Nursing and Quality (MH Directorate) has also improved clarity for staff and the patient in relation to the requirements of the granting of leave. There has been an appreciable improvement in adherence to policies and record keeping as demonstrated in recent audits.\\n\\nIn May 2022, an audit of the section 17 leave forms was completed, and reasonable assurance was provided. The review was undertaken to ensure that the completion of section 17 leave forms aligns with the Trust Policy, in particular:\\n\\x183 To ensure non-Approved Clinicians discuss the Section 17 paperwork with the covering Approved Clinician and document this discussion.\\n\\x183 To check the ward staff are aware of the process of covering Approved Clinicians.\\n\\x183 Target standard is 100% to be documented for patients on Section 2 or 3 requiring Section 17 leave.\\n\\nFollow up reviews have been undertaken, in both February 2024 and August 2024 as part of the Quality Improvement clinical audit cycle. Areas of good practice observed included:\\n\\x183 All patients who had discussed Section 17 leave had a completed corresponding Section 17 Leave Form in their Mental Health Act Folders on the ward.\\n\\x183 100% of staff asked explained that they were aware of the process of how to support a patient being granted Section 17 leave, and also who the corresponding covering Approved Clinician was for their ward.\\n\\nI am also pleased to confirm that as of November 2024, all 16 inpatient wards in the Mental Health Directorate now have a named consultant who is an Approved Clinician (AC) as their Responsible Clinician (RC).\\n\\nResponse to Concern 2:\\nIt is understood and accepted that when Mr. Hope was detained at the end of May 2023, the police kept his mobile phone. As a result, Mr. Hope was unable to use his personal mobile phone when on leave.\\n\\nThe Trust has undertaken a substantial amount of work in relation to the process for granting and implementing Section 17 leave over the past few years. The statement on the final day of the inquest prepared by [redacted], Associate Director of Nursing and Quality (MH Directorate) set out the details of the improvement work already in place.\\n\\nThe current Section 17 leave policy states that the Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT) must check and confirm that the patient is aware of how to contact the ward and have the resources to do so in the event that they need to during contingency planning for unescorted leave. This is outlined in the policy as follows:\\n\\n5.4.3 Unescorted Leave\\nStaff must ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place. These would have been identified when the decision to (Page 15 of 36) grant unescorted leave was made (prior to that leave commencing). This may also include:\\n\\x183 Transportation,\\n\\x183 Access to accommodation,\\n\\x183 Agreed support arrangements whilst on section 17 leave are in place,\\n\\x183 Patient has the necessary resources to support them during their unescorted leave,\\n\\x183 Patient understands how to and can contact the ward for additional support whilst on leave,\\n\\x183 Patient understands any conditions that are part of the section 17 leave authorisation.\\n\\nThose with a significant interest in the patient e.g., family, carers etc are made aware of the patient\\x19s return to the community unescorted and how they can contact the ward for support or to provide feedback on the leave, subject to the normal considerations of patient confidentiality.\\n\\nThe purpose of Section 17 leave is to facilitate recovery, well-being, and reintegration into society. It might undermine patients' rights under the Mental Health Act if it is blocked for non-clinical reasons.\\n\\nIt is not unusual for patients to be without their own mobile phone for a variety of reasons, including financial constraints, difficulties finding their phone, restricted access (as was the case with Mr Hope), or in certain circumstances, phobias or delusions related to devices like mobile devices. When a patient's leave is being planned and discussed, contingencies for such circumstances will be considered and agreed upon.\\n\\nThe patient's vulnerability, individual risk assessment, previous leave durations, and any contact-related contingencies would all be considered by the MDT. This would entail determining whether the patient has access to any other means of communication, such as through a friend, neighbour, or relative. The MDT will also talk to the patient about alternative ways the ward can get in touch with them while they're on leave in case of any difficulties.\\n\\nAn improvement we have made is the development and implementation of a \\x18contact card\\x19 which will be given to each patient who is accessing leave. The \\x18contact card\\x19 has key phone numbers that a person can ring if they need help including NHS 111, 999, the Crisis Team phone number and the Ward telephone number.\\n\\nAs part of the improvement work to support contingency planning, when discussing and planning Section 17 leave, the Mental Health Directorate is exploring the option of pre-arranged check-ins by the ward team. In this situation patients would be given set times and locations to check in physically or via other means (e.g. landline calls).\\n\\nResponse to Concern 3:\\nThe inquest received evidence from our appointed investigator who, at the request of the court had set out her investigatory experience and the approach the organisation took with regards to the investigation into the death of Mr Hope.\\n\\nThe investigation report set out the sources of information that were used including:\\n\\x183 Carenotes (clinical notes)\\n\\x183 48/72 Hour Report\\n\\x183 Section 17 leave forms\\n\\x183 Staff Interviews and statements provided to the investigating officer.\\n\\x183 Local policies (Absent without Out Leave and Section 17 Leave Policy)\\n\\nThe investigation considered how factors such as the environment, equipment, tasks, and policies influenced the decisions and actions of staff.\\n\\nThe investigation did not conclude with a separate action plan, but it did set out in detail that the issues identified, including AWOL response and Section 17 Leave arrangements, were already subject to improvement as part of a Quality Improvement Plan involving our adult male mental health wards.\\n\\nThe investigation report does not set out the attempts made to engage with the family of Mr Hope. There is evidence that the investigating officer made a number of attempts to engage with the next of kin of Mr Hope. My understanding is that the family dynamics were complex, and some of those dynamics were likely centred on Mr Hope\\x19s mental health and well-being at different points in his life.\\n\\nWe have to strike the balance between seeking engagement, accepting that some families will not want to be involved and also respecting the patient\\x19s right to keeping information confidential in death as well as in life. In the case of Mr Hope I can see evidence, and this was also heard in the inquest setting, that the investigating officer reached out by telephone and text message. The investigating Officer advised that she could attend the family address to go through the report face to face, however she received a text message requesting the report and duty of Candour letter be sent via email and [redacted] (Mr Hope\\x19s mother) provided her personal address. Following receipt of the report and the letter there was further contact via a message sent to the Investigating officer in which [redacted] stated she would read them and get back to her if she needed to. Therefore, we can confirm that we made efforts to engage pre-investigation, during the investigation phase, and at the end of the investigation.\\n\\nThe statement on the final day of the inquest prepared by [redacted], Associate Director of Nursing and Quality (MH Directorate) set out the details of the improvement work already in place, as well our investigation approach. It also explained our transition from the Serious Incident Framework (NHSE, 2015), which focusses on \\x18root cause\\x19, towards adopting the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF) (NHSE, 2022), which moves away from a root cause (blame), and focusses on learning and understanding of the work system, acknowledging that staff and patients are part of the \\x18work system\\x19 and that it is the system that will support good or poor outcomes.\\n\\nWe have utilised NHS England\\x19s PSIRF toolkit to develop our arrangements and have worked with the Integrated Care Board and other local providers to sense check and develop our approach. Our transition to PSIRF is in itself a learning curve that we have to embed and will iterate over time. We have engaged with an external consultancy to support training for staff, support us to build our PSIRF Plan and PSIRF Policy arrangements, and to engage with the Trust Board and other senior leaders from an assurance and oversight perspective. We will continue to take the opportunity to learn from safety events in healthcare and to support the coroner\\x19s office to conduct their investigations.\\n\\nI will write separately to the Area Coroner as I would welcome the chance for myself and colleagues to spend time to talk through some of the key programmes of work we are currently engaged within, particularly focused on our transition works associated with:\\nRisk Assessment / Safety Planning Formulation.\\nManagement of Absent Without Leave.\\nTransition from Serious Incident framework to Patient Safety Incident Response Framework.\\n\\nI of course would be happy to assist you with any additional questions in respect of this matter.\"]), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/neil-yates-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0593', recipients=['NHS England & NHS Improvement (PFDs)', 'The Chief Coroner'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='There is a delay in voluntary and NHS organisations sending information about prescribed medications to the GP surgery.')]), responses=['Thank you for your Report to Prevent Future Deaths (hereafter “Report”) dated 4 November 2024 concerning the death of Neil Michael Yates on 25 April 2023. In advance of responding to the specific concerns raised in your Report, I would like to express my deep condolences to Neil’s family and loved ones. NHS England are keen to assure the family and the Coroner that the concerns raised about Neil’s care have been listened to and reflected upon.\\n\\nYour Report raises concerns over delays to prescribing information for patients being sent to GP surgeries by voluntary and NHS organisations.\\n\\nThere is a National Care Records Service (NCRS), also referred to as the Summary Care Record (SCR), which is often used by care providers as a source of information for a patient’s current medication. The medications displayed on this record are driven by the patient’s GP record as opposed to other sources. This means that there remains a need for medications supplied from sources other than the patient’s GP to be recorded on the GP record before the information can then be made available on the National Care Records Service.\\n\\nThe limitation of medication information within patient clinical records is a known one, and a series of initiatives and work are being undertaken to address this across NHS England, local systems and IT vendors. These include the following:\\n\\n\\x183 A core set of fully “interoperable medicine standards” (IMS) have been defined and tested by early adopters and are available to IT system suppliers.\\n\\x183 An Information Standards Notice (ISN) for Trusts is supporting wider adoption of IMS which have been incorporated into national digital medicines programmes.\\n\\x183 National adoption of IMS to underpin the transfer of medication information at the time of hospital admission and discharge is underway.\\n\\x183 The first NHS Trust has used the IMS as part of the local shared care record.\\n\\x183 GP IT suppliers are now required to deliver the requirements set out in the IMS by June 2025.\\n\\x183 The GP Connect interface, where prescription only medication supplies made from specific settings (e.g. community pharmacies) without being prescribed directly by the GP, can now be electronically recorded into the GP record by the supplying professional.\\n\\x183 Guidance on consolidated patient medication records has been published by the Faculty of Clinical Informatics, as follows: professional-consolidated-medication-record-rendering-guidance-v20-sep-23.pdf\\n\\x183 The Professional Record Standards Body (PRSB) have updated their discharge summary standards: https://theprsb.org/standards/edischarge-summary/\\n\\x183 Work is currently underway to update the medicines specification of the Transfer of Care initiative, i.e. the mechanism to send information from secondary care to primary care.\\n\\x183 NHS England have worked with local Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) to support the development of “local shared care records.” This provides the opportunity for local systems to present medication information across multiple providers.\\n\\x183 This programme of work is seen as a priority by NHS England, and timelines are currently being reviewed but implementation must be managed in line with the differing levels of digital maturity within ICBs.\\n\\nThe full national adoption and implementation of these pieces of work would allow permitted clinicians to have an up-to-date record available along with medicines supply information to aid safe clinical decision making.\\n\\nWork is underway on all these projects, but adoption is required by multiple vendors which makes it difficult to give a specific completion end date. These projects will likely be rolled out over the coming two to five years.\\n\\nRegarding prison screening processes specifically, the reception screening process for those arriving at prison asks the patient about their current medicines, in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline NG57: Recommendations | Physical health of people in prison | Guidance | NICE. This is the basis by which the current medicines are initially recorded and reviewed. A patient receiving treatment in the community under the Substance Misuse Service (SMS) would be referred to the prison’s SMS team for review and a care plan.\\n\\nIt should be noted that morphine sulphate tablets (MST) are not used for substance misuse treatment but are used as an opioid for pain.\\n\\nI would also like to provide further assurances on the national NHS England work taking place around the Reports to Prevent Future Deaths. All reports received are discussed by the Regulation 28 Working Group, comprising Regional Medical Directors, and other clinical and quality colleagues from across the regions. This ensures that key learnings and insights around events, such as the sad death of Neil, are shared across the NHS at both a national and regional level and helps us to pay close attention to any emerging trends that may require further review and action.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/janet-brown-townend-2-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0596', recipients=['A&B Healthcare Ltd', 'Adult Social Services, East Riding of Yorkshire Council', 'Care Quality Commission'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='Carers employed by A&B Healthcare spent insufficient time with Ms Townend, often only 8 to 15 minutes, which was inadequate to complete required tasks such as meal preparation, personal care, and communication.'), ConcernItem(concern='Carers did not escalate concerns when Ms Townend was not eating, despite her comorbidities and risk of infection making nutrition critical.'), ConcernItem(concern='Carers failed to escalate concerns when Ms Townend was unwell with sickness, despite multiple instances of her being sick.'), ConcernItem(concern=\"Carers inaccurately recorded Early Warning Signs (EWS) as no concerns and did not escalate when EWS were present in Ms Townend's condition.\"), ConcernItem(concern='Carers did not follow up to confirm whether Ms Townend had sought GP support after she indicated she would do so when feeling unwell.'), ConcernItem(concern='Carers did not escalate concerns or consider reassessment of capacity when Ms Townend, deemed to have capacity, made unwise decisions such as refusing personal care, food, and medical intervention, leading to deterioration in her condition.')]), responses=['Thank you for naming the Care Quality Commission (CQC) as a respondent in the prevention of future death report issued on 5 November 2024 following the death of Janet Brown.\\n\\nOn 1 April 2015 the CQC assumed enforcement responsibility for health and safety related serious incidents concerning people using services in health and social care settings in England. This is where people using services have sustained avoidable harm including death, have been exposed to a significant risk of avoidable harm, or have suffered a loss of money or property as a result of a failure by the Registered Person. The ‘Registered Person’ is the Registered Provider and/or Registered Manager. Where Registered Providers are corporate bodies (such as limited companies) or unincorporated associations (such as partnerships), individual office holders or members may in certain circumstances be criminally liable under sections 91 and 92 Health and Social Care Act 2008.\\n\\nCriminal enforcement can arise from single specific incidents where the incident and resulting harm provides evidence of a serious breach of a prosecutable regulation by the Registered Provider.\\n\\nWe have reviewed all our records and cannot find that we received a statutory notification in relation to Janet Brown’s death. Failure to provide statutory notifications in accordance with Regulation 16 of the Care Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009 is a criminal offence and we have contacted the service to about this. The provider has advised us that the death did not occur while services were being provided in the carrying on of a regulated activity and no further regulated activity was completed following the admission to hospital. We have requested Janet Brown’s care records so this can be reviewed, and so that we can consider whether any other regulatory action needs to be taken.\\n\\nBridlington was registered with CQC on 7 February 2019 under the current provider, A & B Healthcare Limited. In that time, the location has been inspected twice; once in January 2020 (Appendix 1) and once April 2023 (Appendix 2). On both occasions, the location was rated Good in all the domains assessed. In the time since CQC last inspected Bridlington, ongoing monitoring of the service had not identified any emerging risk.\\n\\nWe note that the concerns are as follows:\\n\\n1. Carers at times spent no more than 15 minutes, on one occasion 8 minutes, with Ms Townend. Bearing in times the tasks, document keeping and care to administer and considering Early Warning Signs have there was no attention to detail; Their duties when there included to prepare meals, conduct personal care if required and talk to the service user. 8 to 15 minutes is not an adequate time to conduct these tasks;\\n\\nBoth inspections of Bridlington found no concerns regarding the deployment of staff and the published reports include positive feedback from people about the support they received. In response to the concerns raised by the coroner concerning the death of Janet Brown, the CQC has received an action plan from the provider addressing the duration of staff visits. We intend to undertake an unannounced assessment of the service which will include staff having adequate time to meet people’s needs. CQC only regulates the carrying out of personal care, however, adequate time must be afforded to staff to support people in a safe, person-centred way (Appendix 1, Appendix 2).\\n\\n2. Carers did not escalate any concerns when Ms Townend was not eating. As Ms Townend had comorbidities and was at risk of infection nutrition was very important;\\n\\nThe inspection of Bridlington in January 2020 found no concerns regarding the support people received to eat and drink and/or the ongoing assessment and monitoring of people’s needs and support to access other healthcare services. The inspection of Bridlington in April 2023 did not include these areas. In response to the concerns raised by the coroner concerning the death of Janet Brown, the CQC has received an action plan from the provider addressing nutrition and hydration. We intend to undertake an unannounced assessment of the service which will include nutrition and hydration and how staff identify people’s changing needs and escalate concerns. (Appendix 1, Appendix 2).\\n\\n3. Carers did not escalate any concerns when Ms Townend was unwell with sickness. There were a number of times Ms Townend presented with having been sick and this was not considered as a concern;\\n\\nNeither inspection of Bridlington raised concerns about staff not escalating concerns about people. The inspection of Bridlington in January 2020 found staff supported people to access health care professionals and referrals were made when required. (Appendix 1). In response to the concerns raised by the coroner concerning the death of Janet Brown, the CQC has received an action plan from the provider addressing how staff will monitor people’s health and well-being. We intend to undertake an unannounced assessment of the service which will include how people are supported to live healthier lives and how the provider will monitor peoples care (Appendix 1, Appendix 2).\\n\\n4. Carers did not accurately record concerns regarding Early Warning Signs (EWS) or escalate when they were present. The EWS were always recorded as no concerns. This was not correct as there were occasions where Ms Townend was displaying signs that were Early Warning Signs which should have been escalated;\\n\\nNeither inspection of Bridlington raised concerns about the accuracy of record keeping. In both cases, our inspections found checks and audits were in place to ensure good governance of the service. (Appendix 1, Appendix 2). In response to the concerns raised by the coroner concerning the death of Janet Brown, the CQC has received an action plan from the provider addressing staff training, oversight of records and processes for escalating concerns. We intend to undertake an unannounced assessment of the service which will include recording keeping, governance processes and oversight of people’s care.\\n\\n5. Carers did not follow up with Ms Townend when she had indicated she was seeking GP support as she was feeling unwell. This was recorded in the Observation Log that Ms Townend said she would contact her GP however the proceeding carers did not enquire whether this had been done;\\n\\nThe inspection of Bridlington in January 2020 found no concerns regarding how staff supported people to access healthcare services and support (Appendix 1). In response to the concerns raised by the coroner concerning the death of Janet Brown, the CQC has received an action plan from the provider addressing their systems for monitoring people’s health effectively within the staff team. We intend to undertake an unannounced assessment of the service which will include governance processes and oversight of people’s care.\\n\\n6. Although Ms Townend was deemed to have capacity carers did not escalate any concerns when Ms Townend was making unwise decisions to refuse personal care, decline food and decline medical intervention. This meant that she was sitting at times in her own faeces and becoming weak and it was not considered whether she needed to be reassessed regarding her capacity.\\n\\nNeither inspection of Bridlington identified concerns regarding staffs ability to recognise and escalate safeguarding concerns. The inspection of Bridlington in January 2020 found staff had a good understanding of safeguarding processes (Appendix 1). In response to the concerns raised by the coroner concerning the death of Janet Brown, the CQC has received an action plan from the provider addressing staff understanding of the mental capacity act. We intend to undertake an unannounced assessment of the service which will include safeguarding and decision making.

Both parties agree with the principle that a set of follow up actions is appropriate but that these need to be proportionate and effective. Following discussions and an assessment on site we propose to take the following action; (1) Improved understanding– Whilst both the county council and EA have a solid understanding of the area and user behaviour, we consider it beneficial to undertake some surveying of people cycling and pedestrian use in the Iffley lock area. This will enable us to better quantify the volumes / type of pedestrian and cycle users in the area as well as details on speed. As usage is affected by seasonality and wider events, we plan to carry out this monitoring spring/ summer 2025. Early assessment of potential monitoring methods suggests there could be a number of different approaches used. This could include the use of cameras and / or detection tubes. Further engagement with user groups would be considered beneficial to informing further details on the type and duration of monitoring which would be necessary both before and after any intervention measures. (2) Vegetation clearance – Whilst it is noted that the fatality took place in December when typically, overgrown trees/ vegetation may be less of a factor, both organisations appreciate that especially during summer months vegetation growth can restrict user space and visibility increasing the likelihood of conflict. Both the county council and EA will undertake volunteer clearance work around the Iffley lock site and plan to undertake this winter/ early 2025. (3) Signage and promotion – It is noted that there is already various signage in the vicinity of the site and along the towpath. This said, a review of signage will be undertaken to give consideration for whether additional signage would be beneficial including at key entrance points along the towpath. We aim to carry out an audit of signage in winter/ early 2025 with implementation of any appropriate measures expected for the summer 2025. Additionally, we are proposing to organise with partners and user groups a series of promotional events spread throughout the year would highlight safe and responsible use of the towpath. As an example, there are several high-profile rowing events along the river in the spring / summer period resulting in increased usage. It is proposed that promotional activity at events like these could provide a meaningful impact with a potentially large catchment of users. Similar events focussing on the councils Vision Zero programme have been held in Oxford over recent years and have had positive feedback. We consider this measure would have a beneficial relevance and reach to the wider towpath route including the Iffley lock site. We plan to commence this from spring 2025. The above committed action is subject to engagement with local councillors and key stakeholders in the development and implementation of the above measures in early 2025. I trust that this note provides the reassurance required, however please do not hesitate to contact should you wish to discuss further. I am happy to provide you with an update of the planned action outlined by end August 2025 if desired.']), ReportConcerns(url='https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/jagjeet-singh-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/', report_id='2024-0606', recipients=['Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Department of Health and Social Care', 'Chief Executive, NHS England'], concern_set=ConcernSet(concerns=[ConcernItem(concern='There was no mental health bed available for Mr Singh upon discharge from medical wards, leading to inadequate accommodation arrangements.'), ConcernItem(concern='The chronic shortage of mental health beds, described as a crisis, affects the ability to provide appropriate inpatient care.')]), responses=['Thank you for your Regulation 28 report to prevent future deaths dated 4 November 2024 about the death of Jagjeet Singh. I am replying as the Minister with responsibility for mental health and patient safety.\\n\\nFirstly, I would like to say how saddened I was to read of the circumstances of Jagjeet’s death and I offer my sincere condolences to his family and loved ones. The circumstances your report describes are concerning and I am grateful to you for bringing these matters to my attention.\\n\\nI understand your concerns about a bed on the mental health ward not being available for Mr Singh when he was discharged from the medical wards. I note that you have also addressed these matters of concern to the Chief Executive of NHS England. I look forward to seeing her response and working with NHS England where appropriate, to avoid a repetition of the tragic events of this case.\\n\\nI recognise the impact that a suitable bed not being available can have on a patient’s care, as exemplified in Jagjeet’s case.\\n\\nI am sure you will appreciate that the number of mental health inpatient beds required to support a local population is dependent on both local mental health need and the effectiveness of the whole local mental health system in providing timely access to care and supporting people to stay well in the community, therefore reducing the likelihood of an inpatient admission being necessary.\\n\\nI expect individual trusts and local health systems to effectively assess and manage bed capacity, the ‘flow’ of patients being discharged or moving to another setting and the availability of specialist personality disorder rehabilitation units. I recognise that mental health services have been under significant strain in recent years due to the rise in demand.\\n\\nOver the past few years, the NHS has been developing the community mental health framework with the aim of improving community support for people with severe mental illness, thus avoiding the need for an inpatient admission where possible and freeing up more beds.\\n\\nNHS England’s 2024/25 priorities and operational planning guidance reinforces this focus on improving patient flow as a key priority – with local health systems directed to reduce the average length of stay in adult acute mental health wards to deliver more timely access to local beds. And in areas where there is a clear need for more beds, this has been addressed in part through investment in new units.\\n\\nIt is also important that when people are discharged, this happens in a way that considers their needs on discharge and any risks to their safety. To help support safe and timely discharge decisions, the Department published statutory guidance on Discharge from mental health inpatient settings in January 2024 and which is available at: Discharge from mental health inpatient settings - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk). This sets out how health and care systems should work together to support safe discharge from all mental health and learning disability and autism inpatient settings for children, young people and adults.\\n\\nAs part of our mission to build an NHS fit for the future, we will make sure more mental health care is delivered in the community, close to people’s homes, through new models of care and support, so that fewer people need to go into hospital.\\n\\nI hope this response is helpful. Thank you for bringing these concerns to my attention.', 'Thank you for your Report to Prevent Future Deaths (hereafter “Report”) dated 4 November 2024 concerning the death of Jagjeet Singh on 8 March 2024. In advance of responding to the specific concerns raised in your Report, I would like to express my deep condolences to Jagjeet’s family and loved ones. NHS England are keen to assure the family and the Coroner that the concerns raised about Jagjeet’s care have been listened to and reflected upon.\\n\\nYour Report raises concerns over a chronic shortage of inpatient mental health beds, both within the London region and nationally. In relation to Jagjeet’s care, you have raised that a bed on the mental health ward should have been available for him when he was discharged from the medical ward.\\n\\nThe number of mental health beds required to support a local population is dependent on both local mental health need and the effectiveness of the whole local mental health system in providing timely access to care and supporting people to stay well in the community, therefore reducing the likelihood of an admission being necessary.\\n\\nIn some local areas there is a need for more beds, this is being addressed in part through investment in new units and additionally as part of a whole system transformation approach. This was supported by the NHS Long Term Plan (LTP), which saw an additional £2.3 billion funding invested in mental health services from 2019/20 – 2023/24, around £1.3 billion of which was for adult community, crisis and acute mental health services to help people get quicker access to the care they need and prevent avoidable deterioration and hospital admission. NHS England’s 2024/25 priorities and operational planning guidance reinforces this focus on improving patient flow as a key priority – with systems directed to reduce the average length of stay in adult acute mental health wards in order to deliver more timely access to local beds.\\n\\nTo address the wider system issues that impact on health services, a further £1.6 billion has been made available via the Better Care Fund from 2023-25. This funding can be used to support mental health inpatient services as well as the wider system which should help to reduce pressures on local inpatient services, so that those who need to access beds can do so quickly and locally.\\n\\nThis is being supplemented by a further £42 million recurrent investment from 2024/25 for all Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) in the country to recommission inpatient care, in line with local models that provide the best evidence of therapeutic support.\\n\\nMy Clinical Quality regional colleagues in London are engaging with North East London Integrated Care Board on the concerns raised in your Report and system arrangements for mental health inpatient beds.\\n\\nI would also like to provide further assurances on the national NHS England work taking place around the Reports to Prevent Future Deaths.

On admission, her Waterlow score indicated a high risk of pressure sores. That score was underestimated and the correct score would have indicated a very high risk. She spent almost 18 hours in ED, during which time she was positioned on a trolley without pressure area care.\\n\\nIt is probable that Mrs Tromans' tissue damage accelerated during her prolonged stay in the Emergency Department. Her Waterlow score upon admission indicated a high risk of pressure sores, but the actual score should have indicated a very high risk i.e. the tissue substrate was poor. She was positioned on a trolley for nearly 18 hours in the ED without adequate heightened levels of pressure area care, which likely contributed to the development of her pressure sores.\\n\\nIn response to this, several measures are being taken to prevent future occurrences. Due to the increasing demand on the ED, which has led to patients spending longer than desirable periods in the department, the Tissue Viability team has collaborated with ED Matrons to implement a project aimed at reducing pressure ulcers in the ED. This includes:\\n\\nEducation: A targeted training program for ED staff covering topics such as pressure ulcer categorization, reporting mechanisms, skin inspections, and repositioning techniques.\\nEquipment: The introduction of new trolley mattresses with deeper pressure-relieving foam and the use of pillows to offload pressure from patients’ heels. This equipment is not conventionally used in ED but will now be available in this setting.\\nDocumentation: A booklet supporting accurate completion of Waterlow scores is being updated and will soon be relaunched to ensure proper documentation across the Trust.\\n\\nFurthermore, skin champions have been introduced in the ED, with staff undergoing comprehensive training. The department is also working on auditing trolley mattresses to ensure they provide effective pressure reduction, with plans for a trolley audit program in place.\\n\\nAssurance: The implementation of these measures will be monitored through regular audits of pressure ulcer data in the ED to assess effectiveness and identify areas requiring further intervention.\\n\\n2.Mrs Tromans had a repositioning schedule in place when she was admitted to the Acute Medical Unit and subsequently to ward East Ground B. This required repositioning at no greater intervals of four hours to mitigate the risk of pressure sores. On a total of 22 occasions during her inpatient stay, the schedule was not adhered to. This led to occasions where Mrs Tromans was left in the same position for up to 14 hours.\\n\\nMrs Tromans was admitted to the Acute Medical Unit (AMU) and subsequently to Ward East Ground B, where she had a repositioning schedule that required her to be repositioned every four hours to prevent pressure sores. However, the schedule was not adhered to on 22 occasions, resulting in her remaining in the same position for up to 14 hours, likely contributing to the deterioration of her condition.\\n\\nIn response, several actions are being taken:\\n\\nTraining: In December, two Tissue Viability Link Worker events focused on repositioning were held, with support from therapy teams using pressure mapping devices to identify pressure points and promote effective repositioning. The sessions also provided education on anatomy and physiology, with an emphasis on safe side-lying techniques to relieve pressure.\\nCompliance Monitoring: A weekly audit of repositioning practices in the AMU is now being conducted, with real-time feedback provided to staff. The AMU also receives regular communications emphasizing the importance of following the repositioning schedule and completing daily care plans.\\nResponse Assessment Tool (RAT): The Tissue Viability team has implemented the RAT to scope trust-acquired pressure ulcer events. This tool, which will be used by senior staff to ensure repositioning strategies are being followed, will be audited for compliance and quality.\\n\\nAssurance: The implementation of regular audits and ongoing educational efforts will be monitored, with results reviewed in the spring of 2025 to assess improvements in repositioning practices and a reduction in pressure ulcer incidence.\\n\\n3.East Ground B ward had a paper version of a wound care plan which was designed to provide detailed monitoring of her skin condition and a treatment plan for pressure sore care. This was not completed at any stage.\\n\\nOn Ward East Ground B, there was a paper-based wound care plan designed to monitor Mrs Tromans’ skin condition and provide a treatment plan for her pressure sores. However, this plan was not completed at any point during her stay, which hindered the timely and effective management of her pressure sores.\\n\\nThe Trust has responded by updating its wound care tools and processes:\\n\\nUpdated Wound Assessment Chart: The Wound Assessment Chart has been recently updated as part of the Wound Product Formulary review. This document is now available to staff, who are being trained in its use during patient reviews. The chart will be used to document skin assessments and treatment plans.\\nEducation and Training: The clinical educator for the Healthcare of Older Patients (HCOP) service is delivering additional training across ward areas, with senior staff leading bi-monthly sessions to reinforce pressure ulcer prevention and care.\\n\\nAssurance: The use of the updated wound assessment chart will be monitored through patient assessments and quarterly audits to ensure proper documentation and adherence to care plans.\\n\\n4. The Matron's investigation into these gaps in care did not seek to establish why they had occurred. This raises a concern about the quality and efficacy of the Trust's post-death investigations which in turn raises a concern for future deaths.\\n\\nThe Matron's investigation into the gaps in care did not thoroughly explore why these failures occurred, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of post-death investigations within the Trust. A more comprehensive investigation would involve speaking directly with staff involved in care delivery to understand the root causes of care failures.\\n\\nIn response to this, the leadership team has reflected on the investigation process and acknowledged the need for individual fact-finding interviews with staff involved in care delivery. Moving forward:\\n\\nImproved Investigation Process: The investigation process will be revised to include individual statements from staff involved in care, ensuring that all aspects of care delivery are fully explored. These findings will be embedded into roundtable reports to provide greater assurance that all contributing factors are understood and addressed.\\nLearning Dissemination: The findings from the investigation will be shared across all relevant clinical teams, with regular updates and action plans to ensure that lessons are learned and improvements are made.\\n\\nAssurance: The Trust will continue to focus on improving its investigation process to ensure that the causes of care gaps are thoroughly examined and that appropriate corrective actions are taken. Regular reports will be presented to senior leadership to track progress.\\n\\nWider Learning and Improvement\\n\\nThe issues identified in Mrs Tromans’ care have prompted widespread changes across the Emergency Medicine, Acute Medicine, and Healthcare of Older People (HCOP) services. The case has been shared at the QEHB Care Quality Meeting to disseminate learning, and actions are being reported through clinical delivery groups’ Quality and Safety meetings. Additionally, improvements in care delivery, monitoring compliance with standards, and preventing future incidents of pressure ulcers will continue to be a focus for ongoing staff education, audits, and process improvements across the Trust.\\n\\nThese actions aim to enhance patient safety, improve pressure ulcer prevention, and ensure that staff are equipped with the necessary knowledge and resources to provide high-quality care.\\n\\nI would like to assure you that the concerns raised within the Regulation 28 Report have been taken extremely seriously, which I hope is demonstrated in the steps that have been taken following Mrs Tromans’ death.\"])])"

       "  'responses': [\"Thank you for your Report to Prevent Future Deaths (hereafter “Report”) dated 13 November 2024 concerning the death of Joel Phillip Colk on 2 October 2023. In advance of responding to the specific concerns raised in your Report, I would like to express my deep condolences to Joel’s family and loved ones. NHS England are keen to assure the family and the Coroner that the concerns raised about Joel’s care have been listened to and reflected upon.\\n\\nIn your Report, you raised that the NHS Pathways system does not differentiate between types of, severity of or the drugs / chemicals reported as being the cause of an overdose. The system also does not take into account the amount reported as ingested, the timing of ingestion or the patient's weight. In the case of sodium nitrite ingestion, treatment is only effective if medications are administered before the patient suffers a cardiac arrest. The Coroner’s view is that the Pathways system does not reflect the time sensitive nature for an effective response.\\n\\nThe NHS Pathways Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is a triage product that is used to support call handlers (health advisors) in urgent and emergency care (UEC) services. The product is owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and is manufactured and managed by the Transformation Directorate of NHS England. It is used in NHS 111 and over half of 999 ambulance services.\\n\\nNHS Pathways is an interlinked series of algorithms, or pathways, that link questions and care advice to lead to clinical endpoints known as “dispositions”. The system presents a series of questions in order that the most appropriate clinical response or disposition may be determined based on the presenting symptoms. A disposition will specify the skill set and time frame that a patient requires and, where required, appropriate care/worsening advice is provided.\\n\\nNHS Pathways is built around a clinical hierarchy, meaning that life-threatening symptoms are assessed at the start of the call to trigger ambulance responses, progressing through to less urgent symptoms which require a less urgent response (or disposition) in other settings. NHS Pathways is not diagnostic, but instead works on the basis of 'ruling out'.\\n\\nClinical Governance of the NHS Pathways Product\\n\\nThe safety of the clinical triage process endpoints resulting from a 111 or 999 assessment using NHS Pathways, is overseen by the National Clinical Assurance Group (NCAG), an independent intercollegiate group hosted by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC). This group is made up of representatives from Medical Royal Colleges and other clinical professional bodies and groups. Senior clinicians from these organisations provide independent oversight and scrutiny of the NHS Pathways clinical content. The group considers all aspects of the triage process, including the impact on services, as well as the evidence base for changes to the clinical content. All changes to, and development of, the core telephone system and other platforms, are formally documented and presented for a critique in accordance with agreed processes endorsed by NCAG.\\n\\nAlongside this independent oversight, NHS Pathways ensures its clinical content and assessment protocols are consistent with the latest advice from respected bodies that provide evidence and guidance for clinical practice in the UK.\\n\\nOverview of the Management of Overdoses and Suicidal Callers\\n\\nAmbulance Emergency Operation Centres (EOCs) use one of two approved triage tools to take 999 emergency calls – AMPDS or NHS Pathways. The outcome (disposition) reached at the conclusion of the initial assessment must be mapped to approved, contracted standards. There is a requirement to map these outcomes to the various categories (Categories 1 – 5) set out within the NHS Constitution and Ambulance Service 999 contracts. Category 5 (originally Category 4H) relates to calls that do not require an ambulance response; there is no standard for Category 5 calls.\\n\\nThe grading of 999 calls are clinically based decisions and any changes are considered by the NHS England Emergency Call Prioritisation Advisory Group (ECPAG), based on receipt of a review of the evidence base with formal recommendations from the NHS England Clinical Coding Review Group (CCRG), with endorsement of the clinical rationale of proposed changes by the National Ambulance Service Medical Directors group (NASMeD). Any recommendations that are made and implemented will be formally reviewed with ongoing monitoring from ECPAG.\\n\\nOverdoses, whether intentional or accidental, can be challenging cases to assess remotely; many different substances, medicines, doses and combinations are possible. This poses challenges to classify and appraise the relative lethality of the substances involved and balance this risk against the symptoms and circumstances at the time of the call. Where an overdose has occurred, and in the absence of signs or symptoms indicating an immediate life-threat (reduced consciousness level, breathlessness or shock, for example), the lowest disposition that can be reached is a Category 3 ambulance response. A higher response will be reached where there are symptoms indicating an immediate threat to life.\\n\\nAmbulance EOCs follow specific principles on their respective triage tool to ensure clinical oversight for patients calling and presenting with overdose and suicidal ideations. These principles have been reviewed and strengthened through several national recommendations since 2019.\\n\\nFirstly, on 2 April 2019, Professor [REDACTED] – the then National Clinical Director for Urgent and Emergency Care at NHS England – wrote to ambulance trusts and NHS 111 providers to mandate that robust clinical oversight was in place in control rooms and call centres to monitor self-harm and suicidal patients safely and effectively.\\n\\nSecondly, in 2020, the then Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB), investigated the potentially under-recognised risk of harm from the use of propranolol. They made a safety recommendation for NHS England to evaluate current approaches to clinical oversight of overdose calls within ambulance control rooms, and to develop a national framework to describe requirements for appropriate clinical oversight of overdose calls.\\n\\nIn April 2021, NHS England in conjunction with the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) published a new operational procedure for all ambulance services in England entitled, “Category 3/ 999 Overdose and Suicidal Ideation Calls; Initial Assessment of Lethality/Toxicity Principles Document”). This document followed a detailed review that had been undertaken to consider agreed ambulance control room processes, to ensure suicidal patients receive the correct clinical response. This review had also been the catalyst for NHS England contacting all ambulance and NHS 111 services in early 2019 as described above. The guidance highlights the critical importance of clinical oversight and review (rather than, for example, a re-categorisation of calls to Category 1 on a case-by-case basis) and sets out that:\\n\\n• where an overdose is declared, further clinical intervention should take place within 30 minutes, or the case must be automatically upgraded if this does not occur within 40 minutes.\\n• it is good practice for TOXBASE® (clinical toxicology database of the UK National Poisons Information Service) to be viewed for each overdose / accidental ingestion incident, despite the familiarity of the reviewing clinician with that particular toxicity profile, which includes sodium nitrite. It is noted that management practices often change in relation to specific toxins, therefore guidance around the use of TOXBASE® was issued instead. Utilising TOXBASE® similarly ensures that the relevant current guidance is accessed when managing emerging and novel substance ingestion enabling the clinician to assess risk on an individual case basis.\\n• the initial clinical review should also consider any ongoing suicidal ideation with a specific plan / means.\\n\\nMost recently, the overdose guidance was updated in November 2023 to include callers who reach a Category 5 disposition (hear and treat). This followed a review by ECPAG, NHS England and NASMeD, part of the AACE, to ensure it remained clinically fit for purpose. For those cases which do not automatically result in a Category 1 or 2 emergency ambulance response, an urgent remote clinical assessment will take place, pending which the case will be dealt with as a Category 3 emergency ambulance response. The objective of further remote clinical assessment is to determine the likely threat to the patient by gathering the clinical information about the substance(s) ingested and their quantities. Following this assessment, if the clinical view is that the case should be upgraded to a Category 1 or 2 emergency ambulance response, then this is done without delay.\\n\\nIn early 2019, NHS England also instructed ambulance and NHS 111 providers that any suicide-related cases reaching a Category 3 ambulance outcome should receive urgent clinical review. This would enable a clinician to consider the individual circumstances of each case, with a view to determining whether the case should be clinically upgraded to a Category 1 or 2 emergency ambulance response.\\n\\nIn response to this request, and in order to assist organisations in easily identifying the cases that needed an urgent clinical review, NHS Pathways introduced a new disposition code ‘Dx0124 Emergency Ambulance Response for Risk of Suicide (Category 3)’. This disposition code raises the visibility of such cases, enabling such urgent clinical review. This review by clinicians could involve re-triage to higher levels of response if required. It has also facilitated clearer visibility of such cases within the ambulance dispatch queue. This is in addition to information which was already fed into the dispatch system by NHS Pathways by way of ‘symptom discriminator codes’. NHS Pathways has a code identifying suicidal means and a plan (SD4244- AMB suicidal means and a plan). The disposition code was deployed to all service users as part of Release 18 in October 2019.\\n\\nShould national guidance or standards be amended such that toxic substances, where identified, impact on ambulance categorisation or disposition, NHS England would align the NHS Pathways system accordingly.\\n\\nYour second concern relates to the fact that it is not national protocol for ambulance services to carry antidote medication (Methylene Blue) for on-scene administration. You have raised that patients who have ingested [REDACTED] often enter cardiac arrest before arriving at an acute hospital within an Emergency Department.\\n\\nThe carrying of particular medication by ambulance services is an operational issue and is up to individual ambulance trusts; NHS England does not mandate such issues. NHS England is aware of a small number of ambulance specialist units who carry Methylene Blue. This antidote is carried by specialist clinical teams for administration in cases of moderate/severe [REDACTED] poisoning which can be measured through an exhaled breath monitor. Clinical feedback suggests it is likely Methylene Blue would not be used except for severe cases or where there is a long journey time to definitive care.\\n\\nI would also like to provide further assurances on the national NHS England work taking place around the Reports to Prevent Future Deaths. All reports received are discussed by the Regulation 28 Working Group, comprising Regional Medical Directors, and other clinical and quality colleagues from across the regions. This ensures that key learnings and insights around events, such as the sad death of Joel, are shared across the NHS at both a national and regional level and helps us to pay close attention to any emerging trends that may require further review and action.\",\n",
       "   \"I write in response to the Regulation 28 Prevention of Future Deaths report issued on 13 November 2024 to the South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SECAmb) following the inquest into the sad death of Mr Colk.\\n\\nI was very sorry to learn of the death of Mr Colk and I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.\\n\\nI note the other relevant organisations named in this PFD report:\\n\\nNHS England & NHS Improvement\\n\\nWith regard your first matter of concern:\\n\\n“The Court heard that when a call is made to 999 that the call is categorised using NHS Pathways and that all overdoses would be in the same classification resulting in the same disposition and response category. The system does not differentiate between types of, severity of or the drugs/chemicals reported as being the cause of the overdose. The system also does not differentiate call classification taking into account the amount reported as ingested, the timing of ingestion or the patient's weight. The Court heard that all of these factors can impact on the time in which care needs to be rendered to prevent death. The example given to the Court was that someone who had taken a relatively small paracetamol that would be unlikely to cause harm would, using Pathways, have the same resultant disposition as someone who had ingested a significant amount of a known lethal chemical.\\n\\nThe Court heard that in the case of [redacted] ingestion that treatment is only effective if medications are administered before the patient suffers a cardiac arrest. This likely will occur incredibly rapidly and is a known effect of the chemical. The Pathways system does not reflect the time sensitive nature for an effective response when it is known that sodium nitrite has been ingested and would not create a higher disposition requiring more urgent attendance than category 3.”\\n\\nThe NHS Pathways Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is a triage product that is used to support call handlers (known as Emergency Medical Advisors within SECAmb). The product is owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and is manufactured and managed by the Transformation Directorate of NHS England.\\n\\nNHS Pathways as a product has independent oversight by the National Clinical Assurance Group (NCAG), which in turn is hosted by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC). Robust processes exist nationally to provide scrutiny of the NHS Pathways clinical content, which is built around a clinical hierarchy, meaning that life-threatening symptoms are assessed at the start of the call to trigger ambulance responses.\\n\\nIt is widely acknowledged that overdoses, both intentional or accidental, are challenging to assess remotely, with a vast array of different substances being presented to urgent and emergency care services resulting in a significant variance of potential toxidromes.\\n\\nThis is further challenged in the absence of signs and symptoms which would be indicative of an immediate threat to life; symptoms indicating a compromise of airway, breathing or circulation do receive Category 1 or Category 2 ambulance dispositions within overdose presentations.\\n\\nWhen an absence of immediately life-threatening symptoms such as the above is being presented in intentional overdose, the lowest ambulance disposition that can be reached is a Category 3 emergency ambulance outcome. However this Category 3 outcome is supported by additional measures specific to overdose that have been in place within SECAmb since July 2019 and further amendments to local procedures following the publication of a operational guidance by NHS England and the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) entitled, “Category 3 – 999 Overdose and Suicidal Ideation Calls; Initial Assessment of Lethality / Toxicity Principles Document” in April 2021, subsequently being further updated in November 2023.\\n\\nSECAmb has procedures and processes in place to fully follow the principles as set out, which include:\\n\\nWhere an overdose is declared, further clinical intervention should take place within 30 minutes, or the case must be automatically upgraded if this does not occur within 40 minutes.\\n\\nIt is good practice for TOXBASE® (clinical toxicology database of the UK National Poisons Information Service) to be viewed for each overdose / accidental ingestion incident, despite the familiarity of the reviewing clinician with that particular toxicity profile, which includes [redacted]. It is noted that management practices often change in relation to specific toxins, therefore guidance around the use of TOXBASE® was issued instead. Utilising TOXBASE® similarly ensures that the relevant current guidance is accessed when managing emerging and novel substance ingestion enabling the clinician to assess risk on an individual case basis.\\n\\nThe initial clinical review should also consider any ongoing suicidal ideation with a specific plan / means.\\n\\nAlthough SECAmb followed the 999 Overdose and suicidal ideation calls – initial assessment of lethality / toxicity principles with the call being automatically upgraded to a Category 2 response as a clinical review did not take place within 40 minutes, we do recognise that in this case Mr Colk volunteered the information to the 999 call handler that he had taken [redacted]. Recent reports cited within a PFD response provided by the National Ambulance Resilience Unit (NARU) indicate 1 case of [redacted] being ingested for every 0.5 million 999 calls in UK ambulance services, so whilst the incidence of [redacted] poisoning is increasing, it is still a very rare occurrence (Courts and Tribunals Judiciary - Response from NARU, 2024).\\n\\nAs a Trust, we would like to use this case alongside others to support a workstream in early development that we are undertaking, regarding the potential for the use of new and emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence to ‘ambiently listen’ to 999 calls. The aim is to enhance patient safety and reduce human cognitive burden, potentially highlighting certain calls to clinicians that have rare or unique risks earlier. We are in the early stages of understanding this technology and undertaking this work alongside four other NHS Ambulance Trusts as part of the Southern Ambulance Collaborative, and although we envisage if successful this having wider benefits to a range of presentations that 999 ambulance calls present, we have included [redacted] overdose as an example within the proposed case for change.\\n\\nWith regard your second matter of concern:\\n\\n“The Court was also told that clinicians do not carry on any Ambulances within South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust Methylene Blue which is the antidote to [redacted] ingestion as this is not within national guidance. I heard that in some areas there are ongoing trials for some areas that this is on board vehicles within the HART (Hazardous Area Response Team). Therefore in this area the treatment is only available when a patient reaches an acute hospital with an A&E department and the evidence was that often patients enter cardiac arrest before this occurs.”\\n\\nGovernance and Decision-Making\\n\\nSECAmb employs a rigorous and comprehensive governance framework to determine which medications are carried by its clinicians. Our Medicines Governance Group (MGG)—chaired by the Chief Pharmacist and comprising senior clinicians, operational managers, academic representatives, public members, and subject matter experts—oversees all medication-related decisions. Any proposal to add or amend a medicine within our formulary requires a robust New Drug Application (NDA) and consideration of clinical evidence, operational feasibility, financial sustainability, and alignment with national best practice.\\n\\nChallenges in Pre-Hospital Diagnosis and Treatment\\n\\n[Redacted] poisoning causes methaemoglobinaemia, which can only be reliably diagnosed using specialised diagnostic equipment (e.g., Masimo Rainbow SET sensors). In a pre-hospital context, the accurate identification of sodium nitrite ingestion is complicated by non-specific presentations and the unlikelihood of having immediate access to this specialist equipment on every frontline vehicle. Consequently, the administration of methylene blue in the pre-hospital setting poses significant diagnostic and logistical challenges, especially given the low incidence of confirmed sodium nitrite poisonings.\\n\\nAvailability and Cost Implications\\n\\nMethylene blue is supplied in 50 mg vials in the UK, with treatment for methaemoglobinaemia potentially requiring several vials per patient, depending on body weight. Equipping the entire SECAmb fleet of over 300 clinical vehicles with sufficient stock—much of which may expire before use—would place significant demands on the service in terms of finance, logistics and workforce training. Additional resource investment would also be necessary for specialised diagnostic equipment, further complicating routine operations.\\n\\nSpecialist Resource Considerations\\n\\nAlthough certain regions are trialling the use of Hazardous Area Response Teams (HART) to carry methylene blue, these teams are designed for high-risk environments. SECAmb’s HART operates from two bases (Ashford and Crawley), but their geographic reach and the unpredictable nature of [redacted] poisonings do not guarantee they would always be the initial or timely responders to these cases. In many instances, rapid transfer to hospital—where comprehensive evaluation and definitive treatment (such as intubation, ventilation, inotropic support, or exchange transfusion) can be provided—remains the most pragmatic approach.\\n\\nCardiac Arrest Considerations\\n\\nCritically, for those patients who have already sustained a cardiac arrest by the time ambulance clinicians arrive, the likelihood of restoring spontaneous circulation using methylene blue is indicated to be low. Advanced cardiac life support measures—including prompt hospital transfer for definitive care—are therefore prioritised, as per current clinical best practice.\\n\\nOngoing National Discussions\\n\\nSECAmb is aware that discussions are ongoing nationally regarding the role of methylene blue for sodium nitrite poisoning. We remain actively engaged with NHS ambulance services and will carefully review any future recommendations that emerge, particularly if published via JRCALC or other authoritative bodies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, SECAmb remains committed to delivering the highest standard of pre-hospital care within the framework of evidence-based clinical practice. We continuously review our medication formulary in line with emerging guidance and new evidence. At present, and in accordance with current national recommendations, equipping all front-line ambulances with methylene blue and specialist diagnostic tools is neither clinically feasible nor cost-effective. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor evolving guidance and, where appropriate, modify our protocols to maintain patient safety and optimise outcomes.\"],\n",

       "  'responses': ['Thank you for your Regulation 28 Prevention of Deaths report dated 13th November 2024 regarding the tragic death of Andrew Howat. First and foremost, we wish to extend our sincere condolences to Mr Howat’s family and loved ones.\\n\\nAs a business we remain committed to ensuring the highest standards and have carefully reviewed the matters of concern highlighted in your report, wishing to respectfully address the two key points raised: (a) the driver’s adherence to training and guidance; and (b) the failure to contact the police on 999 during the incident.\\n\\nDriver Training\\n\\nThe driver’s decision to discharge the passenger at an unsafe location is deeply regrettable and we acknowledge that their actions on this occasion fell short of the standards we would expect. While drivers are trained to balance their own safety with their duty of care to passengers, we recognise that this tragic outcome signals a need to reinforce and clarify our procedures with drivers.\\n\\nTo further enhance this message, we have updated the “DR18 Driver Information & Advice” document, issued to all drivers upon onboarding. Specifically, two new sections were added (Legal Duty of Care, Incident Procedures: Breakdown, Accident & Violence) and another strengthened (Managing Confrontation & Violent Situations) to provide clearer guidance on resolving confrontation, emphasising duty-of-care and the importance of safe decision-making in difficult circumstances.\\n\\nOn the 3rd January 2025, using our document sharing feature, we have updated all our drivers with the enhanced clearer guidance. As a Company we have taken this opportunity to reach out to all our c. 1,300 drivers covering not just KingKabs but to the wider group, ensuring consistency and firm commitment in our message.\\n\\nPolice Contact Procedure\\n\\n[Redacted] was a manager at KingKabs and was working on the evening of the incident. While an attempt was made by [Redacted] to call 101 (non-emergency services), we understand that this was not successfully completed. Whilst [Redacted] was on hold with 101, he overheard a colleague say there had been a serious accident in the same location. [Redacted] assumed it was linked with his call, hung up immediately and dialled 999.\\n\\nOn review, the process followed by [Redacted] was not adequately documented and the procedures within it could be made more robust. As such and in tandem with the driver procedures, we have documented a new set of ‘Driver Incident Procedures’ in “CC002 Call Centre Procedures” document for call centre staff, which provides clear and detailed guidance on when and how to escalate incidents to the police and other emergency services.\\n\\nThe updated version of CC002 has been sent to all staff on 3rd January 2025.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the proactive measures we have taken, we attach relevant excerpts from the updated “DR18 Driver Information & Advice” and “CC002 Call Centre Procedures” documents. We have not submitted the full documents as they contain commercially sensitive information. We respectfully request that these excerpts be redacted also for commercial privacy purposes before any wider publication.\\n\\nWe are committed to taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our passengers and to address the concerns raised in your report. Should you require any further details or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me directly at [Redacted].'],\n",
