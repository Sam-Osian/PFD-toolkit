ISSUE #1: ACTIVE
Failed HTML extraction for long-text sections.

DETAIL:
Currently the HTML scraper is unable to extract Investigation, Circumstances, and Concerns sections. Consequently, it will 
    always fallback to the .pdf extraction. The issue arises because the HTML content for the previous sections have a <p> 
    tag in most reports, while the long-text sections are nested within a table. I've already tried to devise dedicated HTML 
    pattern-matching functions for these long-text sections, but it's not working.

POSSIBLE FIX: 
More familiarity with how HTML is handled for these long-text sections is likely to be enough. If each report's
    webpage is configured differently, we might need to accept that rule-based HTML extraction will never work and .pdf / LLM
    fallbacks are necessary rather than a contingency.

ISSUE #2: ACTIVE
LibreOffice .docx conversion isn't working.

DETAIL: 
Unclear on why this is happening. I'm also not sure if the MicrosoftOffice converstion works either, as running it requires
    Word to be installed on the local machine (development machine uses Ubuntu 24).

POSSIBLE FIX:
Not sure! Currently the script errors/warnings suggest that the document is never converted, despite the logged message
    stating that it was successful.
