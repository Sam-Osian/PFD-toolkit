ISSUE #1: ACTIVE
Failed HTML extraction for long-text sections.

DETAIL:
Currently the HTML scraper is unable to consistently extract Investigation, Circumstances, and Concerns sections from many reports. 
    Consequently, it will often fallback to the .pdf extraction. The issue arises because the HTML content for the shorter sections have a <p> 
    tag in most reports, while the long-text sections are nested within a table. I've already tried to devise dedicated HTML 
    pattern-matching functions for these long-text sections, but the HTML webpage formats appear inconsistent.

POSSIBLE FIX: 
Need to investigate whether we can make the HTML scraper more granular to cater for different document formats.
However, a convoluted HTML scraper section may not be desirable as it could become difficult to maintain and debug.
Therefore, we may need to accept that frequent reliance on the .pdf fallback is necessary.

ISSUE #2: ACTIVE
LibreOffice .docx conversion doesn't appear to be working.

DETAIL: 
Unclear on why this is happening. I'm also not sure if the MicrosoftOffice converstion works either, as running it requires
    Word to be installed on the local machine (development machine uses Ubuntu 24).

POSSIBLE FIX:
Not sure! Currently the script errors/warnings suggest that the document is never converted, despite the logged message
    stating that it was successful.

Worth also saying that I've only encountered one report so far in .docx format, so this is low priority.
