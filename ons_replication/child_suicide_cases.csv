Stewart,Suffolk,"The Rt Hon Victoria Atkins MP; [REDACTED], Chief Executive NHS England",On 12 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Madeleine Eve Savory. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 August 2023. The inquest was heard without a jury.,"Madeleine Savory was 15 years old when they died. Although not formally diagnosed with a mental health illness, at the time of their death clinicians were considering a working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. Madeleine had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both becoming acute in early February 2022. Madeleine was known to the Child and Young Persons Mental Health Service and to the Paediatric Ward at Ipswich Hospital. All organisations concerned with Madeleine’s care had knowledge of their history of suicidal ideation.

On the 3 February 2022 Madeleine absconded undetected from their school and carried out an act of self-harm which resulted in their hospitalisation. They were subsequently identified as needing a Tier 4 Bed admission on a paediatric mental health ward. Measures were put in place for such a bed to be sourced. At the time of Madeleine’s death a bed was neither identified nor allocated to Madeleine.

During Madeleine's admission on Bergholt Ward at Ipswich Hospital they were assessed as being a high risk of self-harm. Their mood fluctuated and on occasions Madeleine presented with no indication of either suffering from low mood or suicidal ideation. Throughout this period of time Madeleine’s presentation was complex and reflected the working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. A risk assessment on the 12 February 2022 identified the need for additional measures in managing Madeleine’s risk which included mental health observations. These measures were ceased on or around the 14 February 2022. The rationale behind why these measures were ceased is unclear.

On the 19 February 2022, during the evening Bergholt Ward shift, Madeleine appeared settled and an earlier episode of distress during the day seemed to have no further impact on them. At around 22:05 pm Madeleine made their way to the bathroom securing the door behind them. They were not observed by ward staff entering the bathroom and there was a period of up to ten minutes during which Madeleine’s precise whereabouts was unknown. At around 22:20 pm the evening shift Nurse-in-Charge on Bergholt Ward was informed that Madeleine had been in the bathroom for at least ten minutes and was concerned that this period of time was longer than expected. Measures taken to rouse Madeleine by knocking on the door or calling out to them produced no response. Staff subsequently entered the bathroom and found that Madeleine had ligatured themself. Resuscitation efforts resulted in a return of spontaneous circulation and Madeleine was transferred to the Intensive Treatment Unit at Ipswich Hospital. However, Madeleine had suffered a fatal hypoxic brain injury and they sadly passed away on the 26 February 2022.","The availability, nationally, of Tier 4 beds in paediatric mental health facilities to allow for the timely allocation to children in need of care in such facilities such as Madeleine Savory.","""Madeleine Savory was 15 years old when they died""; ""history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm""; ""carried out an act of self-harm which resulted in their hospitalisation""; ""found that Madeleine had ligatured themself""; ""had suffered a fatal hypoxic brain injury and they sadly passed away""",True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 November 2023. I apologise for the delay in the provision of this report. At inquest, I made a determination of death by suicide.",Igor hanged himself in his room at the Depaul London Youth Hub (a hostel for homeless young people) on 30 April 2023.,"On 28 March 2023, Igor refused to get out of the shower [REDACTED]. Hostel staff took various actions, including calling the crisis team. The crisis team decided that Igor did not need daily visits, but told staff to call back if there was any change or further concern.

1. On 14 April 2023, staff found Igor outside, drowsy and incoherent, cold and wet, but did not re-contact the crisis team.

2. Igor was a vulnerable young man, recently homeless, but the last time that any member of staff had a meaningful conversation with him was on 20 April 2023, ten days before he died.

3. The Depaul executive director of services recognised at inquest that there should have been more staff conversation with Igor throughout his time at the London Youth Hub.

4. She also acknowledged that greater attempts should have been made by staff to engage with partner agencies regarding Igor’s care and welfare.

5. Igor was only 18 years old and his father did visit him, but the hostel did not have any contact details for his family.

I heard evidence at inquest that Depaul conducted an internal investigation into Igor’s death. The fact of the report was not disclosed to my office in advance of the inquest as it should have been, and I did not see it until it was mentioned in evidence at the inquest.

However, I have read the report since. It went into some detail and identified that, when Igor was found at 6.25pm, no staff member had undertaken a welfare check of him since half past midnight, whereas there should have been at least one per shift. I was told at inquest that staff were disciplined about this after Igor’s death.

At the time of Igor’s death, there was no national policy on when to increase welfare checks. I was told that there is now national guidance.

The Depaul investigation also identified that staff at the London Youth Hub had not attended self harm and suicide awareness training. I heard that training has now increased and is mandatory.

Allison was 12 years old when she passed away on 19 July 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 August 2023. The conclusion was that Allison died as a result of suicide, contributed to by neglect.","Allison Aules was referred to the mental health team in May 2021 with concerns around evidence of self-harm, low mood, anxiety and enuresis. Her case was inappropriately screened as routine and the referral was triaged 8 weeks later. Allison was not communicated with at this time, but her mother shared a full account of concerns with the triage psychologist. Additional concerns were raised during triage and the matter was taken to a multi-disciplinary team. The team decided that Allison should be assessed face to face. They determined the case to be low risk and placed it in the green zone. The concerns shared with the service should have resulted in a more urgent face to face assessment. The assessment of Allison took place 9 months later. This was not a face-to-face assessment, as directed by the multi-disciplinary team. There was a telephone discussion, initially with Allison’s mother alone. Allison later spoke to the assessor but there was no full assessment of her mental state. There was no full exploration of the concerns raised in the referral and in the triage discussion. There was no evidence of the assessor determining the cause of Allison’s worrying presentation. There was no carefully documented assessment of risk. There was no carefully devised risk management plan. A decision was made to discharge Allison from the mental health team, with no multi-disciplinary review or liaison with the referrer. Allison continued to receive counselling provided at her school, but this concluded at the end of term, on the 15 July 2022. On the 18 July 2022 Allison was found suspended in her bedroom. The failure to provide basic mental health care to Allison contributed to her death.","The Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced.

The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of national concern.

The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country.

There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams.

The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor.

The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10–12 per week. The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week.

Mahmood,Yorkshire West Western,City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council,"On 12 June 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Leah Barber aged 15. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 April 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:
on 3 June 2019, Leah Barber was found deceased at the Bolton Woods Quarry, Bolton Hall Road in Bradford. Leah was suffering a range of mental health pressures in the last 18 months of her life, and her mental health fluctuated in the terms of the nature and severity of those pressures. She had previous thoughts of taking her own life and had tried to do so on two occasions.
On the morning of 3 June 2019 Leah left a note at her home address for family which indicated an intent to take her own life. From the location within the quarry at which she was discovered and a post-mortem examination it was apparent that Leah had fallen from a height of around 30 metres. The evidence showed that Leah had taken her own life.

The medical cause of death was:

1a. Multiple injuries with inhalation of water
1b. Fall from a height",,"A detailed review of the evidence in this case, which included evidence from two schools ([REDACTED]), as well as from Bradford Children's Social Services, the TRACKS Education team (at Bradford Council), the SCIL Team and the Council's SEND Team, revealed that no one person or department at Bradford Council had an overview of the Council's involvement in relation to Leah (prior to her death).

Of greater concern was that that remained so after each of the Council departments involved were notified that Leah had passed away.

Every organisation which had contact with the Coroner's service in relation to Leah's death, with the exception of Bradford Council, was able to provide the Court with an overview/analysis of their involvement with Leah prior to her death and (where appropriate) the lessons they had learnt as a result of their involvement with Leah.

The Police and the local Mental Health Trust were examples of two public bodies who had and were able to provide an overview/analysis to the Court in terms of their involvement with Leah and confirm whether there were any lessons to be learned by them.

The evidence provided by witnesses from the various Bradford Council teams which were involved with Leah, showed a clear disconnect in the involvement of the various Council departments. That was not caused by those individuals who had provided written statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide oral evidence.

Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actions/omissions on the part of individuals/teams within the Council which more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Leah's death, the concern is that Bradford Council appeared not to have a system/process in place which allowed anyone (whether an individual / a team) within the Council to have an overview of deaths where there had been previous Council involvement with the deceased (in this case a child).

In the apparent absence of such oversight Bradford Council would not be able to learn lessons from such cases (or even know if there were lessons to be learned). The absence of such a single point of oversight as was apparent in Leah's case, contributes to the risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.","""Leah Barber aged 15""; ""Leah had previous thoughts of taking her own life and had tried to do so on two occasions""; ""Leah left a note at her home address for family which indicated an intent to take her own life""; ""The evidence showed that Leah had taken her own life.""",True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 March 2023.

How, when and where and, for investigations where section 5(2) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 applies, in what circumstances the deceased came by his or her death.

Shortly after 9am on 2 September 2020, Samuel Thomas Howes suffered fatal injuries when he jumped in front of a train [REDACTED]

He did so in the following circumstances:

a) Samuel suffered from ongoing mental health issues including anxiety and depression.
b) Samuel’s mental health led to his use of drugs and dependency which exacerbated his poor mental health.
c) Samuel was a looked-after child, living in a placement residence
d) That he was free to, and did, leave that residence
e) That early on 2 September 2020, he was recorded by police as being a ‘missing person’
f) That police did not succeed in finding him before he jumped in front of the train

Below are also matters admitted by interested persons:

a) Following Samuel’s arrest on 30 August 2023, neither of the safeguarding forms (specifically, a CYP and a DASH form) was completed by officers of the British Transport Police (BTP)
b) The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) did not request Samuel be assessed by healthcare professionals (in particular a Custody Nurse Practitioner or a member of the Liaison and Diversion Team) while in custody on 30-31 August 2020.
c) The MPS did not progress the investigation to locate Samuel after 3:15pm on 2 September 2020 and before actions were set at 08:04am on 2 September 2020.","A jury found:

Suicide

Samuel's mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death.

We believe that the following matters also possibly made more than minimal, trivial or negligible contributions to his death

a) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the possibility of a rehabilitative placement.

There were inadequate provisions for Samuel's complex needs. In particular, it was noted that no alternative treatments were proactively pursued. The agencies identified Covid as an obstacle to justify their inadequate responses.

b) The failure to inadequately share risk information by Social Services and/or Mental Health Services with each other, and with the police.

A number of factors were noted in this regard:

• Missing risk assessments were not completed consistently
• The Grab Pack was not completed
• Samuel's vulnerabilities and suicide notes were not adequately communicated to the police by Social Services

c) The sharing of risk information by the MPS and/or BTP with partner agencies.

A number of factors were noted in this regard:
• There was a failure to share risk information by the MPS with BTP, as well as with partner agencies.
• In particular, there was a failure to complete and update the CYP Forms, or Merlin, as a result of each agency using their own platform.
• In addition, the BTP did not access the PNC to identify Samuel's Warning Markers

d) Steps taken by the MPS to seek an assessment of Samuel's mental health by a Liaison and Diversion Practitioner whilst he was in custody on 30 and 31 August 2020

The following was noted in this regard:

• Actions noted on THRIVE regarding the provision of a mental health assessment for Samuel were not followed up on multiple occasions.

e) The inadequate approach of staff and the safeguarding processes within Croydon Custody Suite

A number of factors were noted in this regard:

• Samuel's actions were regarded as 'attention-seeking'.
• The DASH and CYP Forms were not completed.
• The limited collaboration between the MPS and BTP led to a lack of recognition of Samuel's mental health needs, resulting in inadequate care.

f) Failures by multiple agencies and the inadequate response to the 'missing persons' investigation conducted by the MPS

A number of factors were noted in this regard:

• Failure to share information by different agencies
• Failure by multiple agencies to contact Samuel's family when he went missing.

g) Samuel's interactions with his girlfriends

The following was noted in this regard:

• Samuel's relationships were described as 'chaotic' and this impacted on his mental health and his behaviour
• In particular, the texts from his girlfriends telling him to 'kill himself' as well as the threats by another girlfriend to end her life, had a significant impact on Samuel's behaviour.","(1) Samuel’s case should be a stimulus for some level of Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service reflection on how different Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service teams are organised and work together.

(2) The delayed response of the Adult Complex Addictions Service to referral and issues related to provision of care to adolescents presenting with mental health vulnerabilities and substance use difficulties.

(3) The lack of a complex service providing, to adolescents, treatment for both substance misuse and mental health issues models, in terms of willingness to engage, being problematic for some young people.

Molly was treated for depression and had a history of chronic self-harm that had required a prolonged hospital admission at St Aubyn’s under the Mental Health Act and did not accept her diagnosis with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Molly was discharged on 17 August 2020 following phased community leave with a plan in place for her mental health. Confusion between different statutory provisions led to her case being closed to social care and, significant delays in this case being reopened. Molly was allocated a social worker five weeks after her discharge for an assessment that was ongoing. Molly attended her Care Programme Approach meeting on 9 October 2020 and left distressed.
Suicide - Social care failed to carry out appropriate requested assessments during Molly’s prolonged hospital admission and there was not a coherent co-ordinated approach to meeting Molly’s social aftercare needs. Molly’s right to aftercare services was recorded but the functions were not discharged as they should have been during her admission, and this contributed to her death.","(1) Molly had a delayed diagnosis of autism. Molly was diagnosed during her detention at the St Aubyn Centre when she experienced a mental health crisis and was detained under the Mental Health Act.

(2) There was insufficient assessment for discharge planning purposes of the impact of Molly’s recent diagnosis of autism by Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.

(3) There was insufficient consideration given to the impact of Molly’s delayed diagnosis of autism on her chronic high risk of suicide in her discharge and discharge planning in a background of Molly not accepting her diagnosis.

(4) Lack of escalation to Essex County Council when there was a failure to respond to requests for assessment and attendance at discharge planning meetings and the key worker/care co-ordinator carrying too heavy a workload as a consequence.

a. act on appropriate referrals to social care by Essex Partnership NHS Trust
b. conduct required assessments of Molly during her detention

Wood,Kent North East,NHS Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board,"On 8 April 2022 I opened an inquest into the death of Stefan Kluibenschadl. At the inquest, which lasted two days and heard from a few of those involved in Stefan’s short life, I concluded on 1 December 2022 with a narrative conclusion “He died as a consequence of his own actions, his intention being unknown”","Stefan suffered from autism and was at school at Laleham Gap where he had been since April 2013. He had annual reviews of his placement at the school and was doing well and at the start of the winter 2020 term had managed to obtain a part time job and was considering career options of either the army or food industry. He had an extremely supportive family and parents who made significant efforts to ensure that he had access to the support he needed.

Both his parents and his school noted a decline in his mental health in December 2021 and he met with the school alongside his parents and his timetable was amended and steps to obtain additional support considered. On 14 January 2022 he told a member of staff at school that he had contacted the National Suicide Prevention helpline but later appeared to deny this. He apparently did not express any intent to harm himself but did express feelings of being low.

His parents, having tried to see what help was available locally, took steps to try to arrange private counselling and arranged for this to start after the February half term. The service the family approached did not consider Stefan was suitable for short term counselling and advice was given to approach his General Practitioner (GP). On 15 March 2022 Stefan’s mum spoke to his GP and asked for a letter to apply for funding from specific autism related counselling which his GP did but this was rejected and the letter received on 17 March 2022. At the consultation which occurred on the telephone between Stefan’s mother and his GP there was no mention of suicidal ideation or self-harm. On Sunday 20 March Stefan was found hanging at home in his bedroom by his family and he was taken to hospital and subsequently transferred to Kings College Hospital where sadly he died on 26 March 2022.","1. During the course of the inquest reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance “Autistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management.” Published on 28 August 2013 and in particular paragraph 1.1.4 which states that “Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with autism has a case manager or key worker to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition to adult care in line with the NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering identification and diagnosis).” Stefan did not have a case manager or key worker.

2. I am unable to say if the lack of a case manager or key worker caused or contributed more than minimally to Stefan’s death but had one been available they may have been able to assist Stefan and his family to navigate the services available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a difference. I am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues where there is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroner’s and Justice Act 2009 creates a duty on Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to a concern which may lead to future deaths.

3. I asked for further evidence on the provision of case managers/key workers in accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East London Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board. It is clear from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19 year olds who have both a learning disability and/or a diagnosis of autism and are at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there is a significant sudden deterioration in the community and the multi disciplinary team has not been responsive. The lowest level of service outlined in reply to the court indicated that referrals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not that they would have a key worker allocated to them. This sets the bar at a level which means a large number of young people with a learning disability and/or autism would not have a key worker nor would they be expected to have one.

4. In the evidence provided it was outlined that “Keyworkers will make sure that these children, young people and families get the right support at the right time. They will make sure that local systems are responsive to fully meeting the young people’s needs in a joined-up way and that whenever it is possible to provide care and treatment in the community with the right support this becomes the norm.” If every autistic child or young person had a key worker this would enable them or their family the opportunity to liaise with their key worker rather than having to try to navigate services themselves. This, in turn, may prevent others from encountering the issues faced by Stefan’s family and ultimately prevent future deaths.","""heard from a few of those involved in Stefan’s short life""; ""Stefan suffered from autism and was at school at Laleham Gap where he had been since April 2013""; ""reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance 'Autistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management.'""; ""On Sunday 20 March Stefan was found hanging at home in his bedroom by his family""",True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The investigation concluded on 30 January 2023 at the end of the inquest that was held before a jury. The jury recorded the following conclusion;

'Suicide with intent.

The death was contributed to by the ineffectiveness of all searches but in particular to the search on 18 June 2021, inadequate post-leave assessment and the omission of Safety Plans which reflect the risks posed to Ania on 18 June 2021.

In respect of the online pharmacies, there was a:

b) Lack of access to the GP Summary Care Records, other pharmacy supplies; and
c) Lack of consent to the sharing of information.'","On 19 June 2021, Ania Sohail collapsed in the lounge area of Griffin Ward, Junction 17 in Prestwich after ingesting [REDACTED] Propranolol tablets which she had secreted onto the ward following periods of home leave. She was taken to North Manchester Hospital and died later that day. A post-mortem examination established that the cause of death was Propranolol toxicity.

Before the fatal overdose on 19 June 2021 and whilst an inpatient on Griffin Ward, Ania had taken overdoses of Propranolol on 10 March and 5 June 2021. Searches of her room had been undertaken following each overdose. Home leave had been suspended following the first overdose before being gradually reintroduced. Following the second overdose, home leave was reinstated on the basis that pre and post leave assessments would be undertaken and Ania would be searched on return to the ward. Searches were conducted on a trauma informed basis and therefore were limited in nature.

Ania's first home leave following the second overdose was on 18 June 2021. When she returned from leave that evening, Ania was searched by a mental health support worker who confiscated two belts from her bag. Ania denied having any other contraband items on her person. There is no documented evidence of the two belts having been found on Ania that evening or that this was handed over to the nurse in charge of the shift. The nurse in charge of the shift has no recollection of being informed of the two belts or of undertaking a post-leave assessment. The entry within the Day notes does not evidence whether or not a post-leave assessment did in fact take place that evening.

Ania collapsed in the lounge area of Griffin Ward at lunch-time the following day. She was on 1:5 observations. The evidence from the support worker with responsibility for undertaking the checks between 10am and 12noon was that for the majority of that time Ania was in her room with the door closed and that the checks were undertaken by knocking on her door every 5 minutes to check that she was alright.

Following her collapse, Ania was conveyed to North Manchester General Hospital where attempts at resuscitation continued until deemed futile. Her death was verified at 15:36 hours that afternoon.","(1) Whilst each individual pharmacy had in-house safety checks to safeguard against over-prescribing by their own pharmacy, there is no integrated system in place which would alert a prescriber to prescriptions that have been dispensed by other on-line pharmacies. As a result, it is currently possible for a patient to obtain excessive quantities of medication by simply placing multiple orders with different on-line pharmacists.

(2) There is no requirement for the on-line pharmacies to share information with the patient's GP. This means that, in the absence of the patient's consent to share information, the online prescriber is reliant on the accuracy and truthfulness of the history provided by the patient.

(3) Lack of information sharing also creates a risk that a GP or Pharmacist Prescriber may unwittingly prescribe a medication that is contraindicated with a medication that has been dispensed through an on-line pharmacy.

(1) The Recovery & Discharge Plans contained inaccurate information regarding Ania's consent to share information with her mother. The evidence was that this was an entry made in error in 6 2020 and was not picked up by any of the nurses who updated the Recovery & Discharge Plan over the subsequent 11 months.

(2) The Recovery & Discharge Plans did not address the risks associated with Ania's procurement of Propranolol from on-line pharmacies. The evidence was that an update of the Recovery & Discharge Plan involved members of nursing staff simply adding a note that the overdoses had taken place. The Plan did not show that any meaningful thought had been given to addressing the particular risk associated with the procurement of on-line medication.

(3) Mandatory refresher training on basic aspects of nursing care such as record keeping, searches, care-planning, undertaking pre- and post-leave assessments and confidentiality is not provided to staff.

(4) There is no requirement for the outcome of negative personal searches to be documented in the records and consequently there is no ability to effectively audit whether searches are taking place and the treating team are unable to assess a patient's level of compliance with rules around bringing contraband items onto the ward.

(5) Searches undertaken of Ania's room following the overdoses on 10.3.2021 and 5.6.2021 were ineffective and did not uncover the Propranolol that Ania had been stockpiling.

(6) Documentation on which 1:5 observations are recorded does not evidence that a check has taken place every 5 minutes. Instead the current documentation simply requires one signature per hour. There is therefore no mechanism by which observations can be effectively audited.

(7) There is no requirement to make a separate entry evidencing that a post-leave assessment has been undertaken. The post-leave assessments are currently subsumed within Day Notes and do not clearly state whether an assessment was undertaken, what was discussed and the outcome of the assessment.","""Suicide with intent""; ""Griffin Ward, Junction 17 in Prestwich""; ""inpatient on Griffin Ward""",True,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Hetherington,Northumberland,Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,"On 6 October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Charley Ann Patterson. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The inquest started on Tuesday 11 October 2022 and concluded today, Friday 14 October 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.","Charley Ann Patterson Deceased suffered with low mood and anxiety related to a number of factors including the restrictions in place due to COVID-19, relationship difficulties with peers and other influences. She had suffered bullying in the period leading up to her death through electronic means. She shared two known previous instances of self-harm involving cutting to her arms which were superficial in nature.

She voluntarily attended Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington with her mother at approximately 20.00 hours on 29 May 2020 after she had self-harmed for the second time a few days prior. She was assessed and promptly referred to and seen by the Psychiatric Liaison Team at approximately 21.30 hours. There were superficial cuts to the left arm which did not require medical intervention and she wanted support with her anxiety and low self-esteem and to learn positive coping strategies for times of emotional distress due to a number of factors. As part of the discharge plan on 29 May 2020 she was referred to the Young Persons Universal Crisis Team and an assessment with them took place upon agreement via telephone on 1 June 2020. She did not meet the criteria for referral to Children and Young Peoples Service as she did not present with a significant degree of psychological distress or mental health difficulty. She was discharged with support netting and a plan where it was discussed and agreed with her and her mother that there would be a referral to the Northumberland (Early Help) Hub. No referral to the Northumberland (Early Help) Hub was made. There was no referral to the mental health trust safeguarding team and there was an absence of communication with other services and professionals although it is not possible to say if those referrals and steps had been undertaken whether the outcome would have been any different.

[REDACTED] Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was commenced, and paramedics arrived, and a return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. She was conveyed by ambulance to Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington and upon arrival was in cardiac arrest. Despite continued attempts at resuscitation life was confirmed extinct at 19.31 hours on 1 October 2020 within Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington. Charley Ann Patterson had left a number of drawings and a note with references to the intention of ending her life.","(1) During the course of the inquest, it was a concern to me the increase in the number of children and young people who are now being seen with regard to their emotional well-being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them requiring support and assessment since the Coronavirus pandemic and the delays that now exist before they receive treatment and support.

(2) I heard that in 2020 if the criteria for referral had been met for referral to Children's Adolescent Mental Health Services there would have been a triage of the child or young person within 8 weeks, treatment within up to 19 weeks with the number of referrals at that time being 1,595. In 2022, subject to meeting the criteria for referral, there would be a triage of the child or young person within 3 weeks but that the waiting time for treatment has increased from up to 19 weeks to up to 63 weeks with the number of referrals being 2,275.

(3) I heard evidence from Cramlington Learning Village where Charley was a pupil and they told me since Charley's death they have strengthened their support for children suffering from anxiety and other mental health issues by increasing the mental health team, employing two emotional literacy teaching assistants, a Mental Health and Well Being Practitioner, another Thrive Practitioner and increased the number of Deputy Safeguarding Leads to 5.

(4) I heard from a Paediatric Nurse Practitioner who is based in the Accident and Emergency at Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington who told me in evidence that in 2020 it was the case that she would see a referral from a child or young person struggling with emotional distress, anxiety, mental health difficulties and instances of self-harm and overdose once a week but that since the Coronavirus pandemic the incidence of assessments for children and young people with those issues has risen from once per week to once per shift. I also heard from the Group Nurse Director for Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust in the North Locality who told me that in May 2020 she would see 100 referrals a month from children experiencing anxiety and mental health difficulties but in May 2022 the number of referrals has increased to 300 children per month. The reason for the referrals is complex but includes the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic with staff seeing an increase in demand in the numbers of young people suffering with anxiety, low self-esteem, body image, OCD and instances of self-harm and overdose.

(5) I ask for there to be an assessment of the services and resources that can be offered to meet the increase in demand in the number of children and young people seeking support with regard to their emotional well-being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them since the Coronavirus pandemic and to reduce the delay in receiving early support in order to avoid a mental health crisis.","""the conclusion of the inquest was suicide""; ""referred to the Young Persons Universal Crisis Team""; ""did not meet the criteria for referral to Children and Young Peoples Service""; ""Cramlington Learning Village where Charley was a pupil""; ""increase in the number of children and young people who are now being seen""; ""referral from a child or young person struggling with emotional distress""; ""referrals from children experiencing anxiety and mental health difficulties""",True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

I opened an inquest on 1 December 2017. The inquest concluded on 30 September 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was “Molly Rose Russell died from an act of self-harm whilst suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content”. The medical cause of death was 1a Suspension.","Molly Rose Russell was found having hanged herself [REDACTED] on 21 November 2017.

Molly was 14 years old.

Molly appeared a normal healthy girl who was flourishing at school, having settled well into secondary school life and displayed an enthusiastic interest in the Performing Arts.

However, Molly had become depressed, a common condition affecting children of this age. This then worsened into a depressive illness. Molly subscribed to a number of online sites.

At the time that these sites were viewed by Molly some of these sites were not safe as they allowed access to adult content that should not have been available for a 14-year-old child to see.

The way that the platforms operated meant that Molly had access to images, video clips and text concerning or concerned with self-harm, suicide or that were otherwise negative or depressing in nature.

The platform operated in such a way using algorithms as to result, in some circumstances, of binge periods of images, video clips and text some of which were selected and provided without Molly requesting them.

These binge periods, if involving this content are likely to have had a negative effect on Molly.

Some of this content romanticised acts of self-harm by young people on themselves.

Other content sought to isolate and discourage discussion with those who may have been able to help.

Molly turned to celebrities for help not realising there was little prospect of a reply.

In some cases, the content was particularly graphic, tending to portray self-harm and suicide as an inevitable consequence of a condition that could not be recovered from.

The sites normalised her condition focusing on a limited and irrational view without any counterbalance of normality.

It is likely that the above material viewed by Molly, already suffering with a depressive illness and vulnerable due to her age, affected her mental health in a negative way and contributed to her death in a more than minimal way.","1. There was no separation between adult and child parts of the platforms or separate platforms for children and adults.
2. There was no age verification when signing up to the online platform.
3. That the content was not controlled so as to be age specific.
4. That algorithms were used to provide content together with adverts.
5. That the parent, guardian or carer did not have access to the material being viewed or any control over that material.
6. That the child’s account was not capable of being separately linked to the parent, guardian or carer’s account for monitoring.

I recommend that consideration is given by the Government to reviewing the provision of internet platforms to children, with reference to harmful online content, separate platforms for adults and children, verification of age before joining the platform, provision of age specific content, the use of algorithms to provide content, the use of advertising and parental guardian or carer control including access to material viewed by a child, and retention of material viewed by a child.

I recommend that consideration is given to the setting up of an independent regulatory body to monitor online platform content with particular regard to the above.

I recommend that consideration is given to enacting such legislation as may be necessary to ensure the protection of children from the effects of harmful online content and the effective regulation of harmful online content.

Although regulation would be a matter for Government I can see no reason why the platforms themselves would not wish to give consideration to self-regulation taking into account the matters raised above.","""Molly Rose Russell, aged 14 years old""; ""Molly was 14 years old""; ""Molly Rose Russell died from an act of self-harm whilst suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content""; ""Molly was found having hanged herself""; ""the content was particularly graphic, tending to portray self-harm and suicide as an inevitable consequence""",True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False

Combes,Yorkshire South West,Cygnet Health Care; NHS England,"On 19 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney born on 11 September 2003. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which commenced on 7 March 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was:-

On the 10th of April 2021 in Cygnet Hospital, Sheffield, Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney performed an act of self-harm by tying 2 non-fixed ligatures. As a result of insufficient care, crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response, this led to her unexpected death two days later on the 12th of April in the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.

There was also a jury questionnaire which was completed and is appended to this Regulation 28 report for information.

The medical cause of death was:

1a: Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy","It is clear from the evidence that was heard during the inquest that Chelsea initially developed a type of eating disorder that required support. She was admitted to a number of mental health inpatient units leading to her admission to Cygnet in Sheffield.

Whilst in this facility a number of material things happened:-

1. Chelsea began to self-harm using ligatures which was a new behaviour
2. Chelsea's working diagnosis became PTSD
3. Chelsea made a number of allegations of abuse by members of her family and others which required investigating
4. Chelsea declined to share information with her family

Chelsea's family were advised that young people are not given a fixed diagnosis and that the working diagnosis was PTSD. Chelsea's family were keen to explore a diagnosis of autism however despite there not being a fixed diagnosis for Chelsea this was not explored by the treating team and Chelsea's diagnosis of PTSD does not appear to have been routinely reviewed through her admission. To be clear; I mean that her diagnosis was not reviewed, not that her treatment and plans were not reviewed. There also seems to have been a move away from a diagnosis of an eating disorder and following the inquest I am not clear that I understand the rationale for this other than PTSD appeared to be a better 'fit' for Chelsea's symptoms.

Ligatures

Chelsea started to use ligatures in Cygnet having not done so previously. Again, this does not appear to have been a cause of significant concern and appears to be the norm within Chelsea's peer cohort. There was one particular issue for Chelsea however which came to light during the inquest which was that male members of staff felt concerned about interacting with Chelsea alone: even where that delayed support in risky situations.

Engagement with Chelsea's Family

I heard evidence that there came a time when Chelsea did not which for her parents to be aware of what was happening in Cygnet or have any information about her health and that she had capacity to make this decision. I have subsequently received the Capacity Assessment that supports this view. I also heard in evidence that the Capacity Assessment ought to have been revisited and that there were circumstances when a patient's wishes could not be respected. This was particularly relevant to Chelsea's mother having limited information and then supporting her on s17 leave. I also heard that Chelsea was supported by a legal advisor for the purposes of her detention under the Mental Health Act.

I also heard no evidence that her age was considered and whether or not she was competent to make this decision even if she had capacity. Chelsea was 17 at the time of her death; this required careful exploration with her and there was no evidence of this.

Emergency Response on the Day of the Final Ligature Incident

I heard evidence that the check on Chelsea was delayed due to another emergency on the unit, namely the tying of a ligature by another individual. I also heard evidence that the timing of Chelsea's checks were not in accordance with recognised policy and ought perhaps to have prompted a different review and approval process (although the timings were appropriate and designed to keep Chelsea safe).

I heard evidence, and the jury expressly accepted, that the alarm being pulled for the other patient using a ligature would be heard by Chelsea and was a relevant factor in her ligature event.

I then heard that when she was checked the member of staff who checked on her would not lay hands on her as he was a male member of staff alone in the room and was worried about repercussions. He therefore sought support from a female member of staff who went to check on Chelsea and realised that she was not conscious. She then shouted for help and a ligature knife. There were then further delays as others came to observe Chelsea, collected the ligature knife, and removed the ligature then commenced CPR with the red bag. The jury found that these delays were unreasonable in the circumstances. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence about the co-ordination of CPR was that every member of staff present believed one individual was leading the CPR response; however, that particular individual was not aware of that. Whilst this did not materially change the CPR in this case it was certainly not indicative of a well-rehearsed and practised response to an emergency situation.","1. The diagnosis whilst described as not being fixed; was not adequately reviewed. The primary witness for Cygnet in relation to diagnosis lacked professional curiosity even when asked questions in evidence. For example dismissing the potential that Chelsea may be hyperbolic in some of her descriptions of incidents and could that be relevant to diagnosis or treatment; evidence from the family about another member of the family with an autism diagnosis was not followed up (the evidence from Cygnet being that they had not been aware the family wished to explore this); nonetheless in evidence it was dismissed as a possibility.
2. Whilst it is important that the young person is believed and has confidence in those with a therapeutic relationship that she will be believed when she makes disclosures; there was almost no professional curiosity about the allegations and whether they spoke to something else going on with Chelsea. The allegations that were made were blindly accepted by the team and one example where this was problematic is that part of Chelsea's PTSD diagnosis was based on flashbacks. One of the flashbacks which she described related to finding her aunt dead. Her aunt was not dead and in fact attended the inquest proceedings however this had not been clarified with the family and the treating team accepted this information from Chelsea unequivocally. It is clear there is a very fine balance to tread as it is clear that Chelsea was suffering from flashbacks and had suffered trauma, there was no demonstrable exploration of this.
3. The decision not to share information with family was made based on one capacity assessment. This did not fully address the issues with Chelsea of understanding the consequences of that decision and neither does it adequately break down the information which Cygnet may wish to share with family. This appears to have been a blanket decision and once a capacity assessment determined that Chelsea had the capacity to make that decision there is not evidence available to me of conversations with Chelsea to establish exactly what she would and would not share with family and that the consequences of those decisions were adequately explored with her. I would have expected, at Chelsea's age, that a social worker would be involved in supporting her with this decision and reviewing it regularly. This decision about her capacity and information sharing were also not revisited which they ought to have been regularly. Not least because Chelsea's mother was responsible for supporting her with s17 leave and was entitled to fully understand the risks to Chelsea or herself through this.
4. There was no evidence of debrief after prior incidents of ligatures or other self-harm attempts and therefore crucial information about Chelsea's state of mind, motivation and methods was missing from future planning and risk assessments.
5. There was limited concern about the number of ligature incidents collectively across the ward. They appear to have been accepted as normal behaviour. There was no record of Chelsea using ligatures prior to her admission onto this ward. This reality for staff appears to have led to a downgrading of the seriousness of the use of ligatures. With staff describing in evidence when they would and would not intervene and what would and would not constitute a serious incident in relation to ligatures (i.e., a hospital admission would be required before it was regarded as a serious incident requiring immediate changes to risk levels and observations). It may be that this approach to ligatures also contributed to the delay in Chelsea's final ligature being removed.
6. Male staff were nervous and uncertain of how to approach Chelsea when they were alone. Clear guidance needed to be made available to them on how to deal with this. Although in evidence staff said that if there was an emergency they would attend even if alone this was not the case in practice as the male member of staff sought female support before recognising that Chelsea was in crisis.
7. The approach of three members of staff checking Chelsea before the ligature knife was brought and used led to avoidable delay. I am aware from the evidence that there are practice exercises involving the 'Red Bag' however I am not clear that the same is practised in relation to the check, identification of a ligature and obtaining and using the ligature knife in these situations.
8. Whilst in evidence I have heard about the practice exercises using the 'Red Bag' it is clear that there was limited confidence and clarity around the CPR needed for Chelsea. There was not a clear structure of one person leading and others knowing exactly what and how to do tasks.
9. There were opportunities for commissioners to support Cygnet earlier when case managing Chelsea's package of care. The new behaviour of using ligatures should have invited professional curiosity from commissioners who should have sought assurance about the overall practice of ligature use and intervention from Cygnet but also what that meant specifically for Chelsea and how Cygnet were keeping her safe. This may have led to a review by Cygnet and a better understanding of Chelsea's ligature use.
10. Commissioners also ought to have spoken to Chelsea themselves and assured themselves about the decision not to share information with her family; particularly her mother who had been a huge support for Chelsea prior to Covid-19. The impact of the cessation of face-to-face visits on anyone detained under the Mental Health Act, but particularly young people like Chelsea appears to have been underestimated.","""Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney born on 11 September 2003""; ""Chelsea was 17 at the time of her death""; ""performed an act of self-harm by tying 2 non-fixed ligatures""; ""this led to her unexpected death""",True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Persaud,London East,"Royal College of Paediatrics & Child Health; NHS England; Medical Director, Health Education England; President, Royal College of Psychiatrists","On the 13 June 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lily May Girton. Lily was 17 years old when she passed away on the 1 June 2019. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 9 August 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion:

Lily Girton took her own life whilst suffering from a mental illness. Her death was contributed to by a failure of the community CAMHS team to expedite an assessment by a psychiatrist; to carefully and robustly assess and manage her risk to self and by a failure to titrate up her anti-depressant medication to an effective dose.","Lily Girton suffered from anxiety, depression and emotional dysregulation. She sought assistance from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in December 2018. She was asked to register with a new GP before she could access the service. On 12 March 2019 she was seen for her first assessment with the team. Later the same day, Lily presented in distress at Euston station and required detention under section 136 of the MHA for her own safety. She was taken to University College Hospital where she was admitted to a paediatric ward and where she received care from the psychiatric liaison team. Following this brief admission, Lily was prescribed antidepressants by her GP who expected the community CAMHS team to continue monitoring and prescribing this medication. The community team did not do this and Lily was not seen by a psychiatrist within the community CAMHS Team. Lily was seen by a social worker within the CAMHS team, who had been appointed as her care co-ordinator. The care co-ordinator provided cognitive behavioural therapy. She did not take steps to expedite the psychiatric appointment; did not take steps to ensure that Lily’s medication was appropriately titrated and did not carefully assess, document and communicate Lily’s risk to self. On the 29 April 2019, Lily was admitted to University Hospital again, requiring a longer admission and presenting with higher risk. The concerns of the hospital team were communicated to the community CAMHS teams, but Lily’s care plan was not materially altered. On the 31 May 2019, Lily was involved in an altercation with a group of males in a kebab shop. She was mocked by the males and she reported that one of the males had hit her. In the early hours of the 1 June 2019, Lily was discovered deceased at her [REDACTED] partner’s home address. Her life was pronounced extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. The altercation in the kebab shop is likely to have contributed to a decline in Lily’s mental state on 31 May 2019. The failings in the care provided to her by the community CAMHS team left Lily without the resilience to manage the decline in her mental state.","The Inquest heard that CAMHS services nationally have a lack of adequate staffing levels in the form of doctors, in the form of psychiatrists, registered mental health nurses and psychotherapy staff. The Inquest heard that consultants often have an average of 130 to 150 active cases on their caseloads. This is substantially higher than the recommended caseloads by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

The lack of staffing and resources contributed to Lily’s death and there is a concern that the ongoing shortages of suitably trained staff within CAMHS teams poses a risk of future deaths of young people.","""Lily was 17 years old when she passed away on the 1 June 2019""; ""Lily Girton took her own life whilst suffering from a mental illness""",True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Schofield,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove","The Rt Hon Steve Barclay, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care","On 10 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Robyn Lily Audrey Skilton aged 14. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 June 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Robyn took her own life whilst struggling with her mental health. The mental health services failed Robyn as they did not recognise the deterioration of her mental health nor provide her with the care and treatment she required. Her death was contributed to by neglect.","On 7 May 2021 Robyn Skilton was found in Southwater Park, having tied a ligature around her neck. Emergency services were called but death was confirmed at 12:51 hrs. Robyn had a history of mental health problems which included self-harming. Despite her deteriorating mental health, at the time of her death, she was still awaiting a formal assessment by a child psychiatrist.","Robyn was failed by the Mental Health Services quite frankly due to the current lack of resourcing and provision in place to support young people struggling with their mental health. Due to the lack of availability of a Child Psychiatrist there are long waiting times for children to be assessed. Robyn was not seen by a Child Psychiatrist and/or Psychologist, despite there being a need for this to happen, thereby enabling her to be diagnosed and receive a treatment plan. Robyn’s parents did everything they could during this period to support Robyn, including paying for a private counsellor, but sadly Robyn’s mental health continued to deteriorate during this time, and she took her own life. Robyn's initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) similarly did not happen in a timely manner.

I do appreciate that the landscape that the local mental health Trust (Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust) was working under and the fact that Covid heightened the level of complexity across many services but there were many failings in the care provided to Robyn.

It became very clear during the Inquest that there is significant underfunding of the local mental health Trust who like many mental health Trusts have seen an explosion of referrals to their Children and Mental Health services (CAMHS).

By way of an example:

Referrals to West Sussex CAMHS have increased by 95.6% from 5/2019 (389) to 5/2022 (761)

West Sussex CAMHS caseload has increased by 85% from 5/2019 (2239) to 5/2022 (4147)

West Sussex CAMHS Duty caseload has increased by 112% from 5/2021 (492) to 5/2022 (1494)

Mental Health A&E presentations, in period 4/2021 - 3/2022, have increased by 40% on previous year (4/2020 - 3/2021).

Additionally, across Sussex CAMHS, as a whole, the referrals data shows:

• 5/2022 was the highest number of referrals the service has ever received (1350).
• Of those 1350 referrals, 80% (1,081) were accepted into the service.
• In comparison, in 5/2019, 579 were accepted (65% accepted)
• So, an additional 502 young people have been accepted in 5/2022 compared to 5/2019

Despite the increase in numbers accessing CAMHS there has not been any relative increase in resources to meet this demand and therefore the current position is unsustainable and it is putting many young people’s lives at risk.","""Robyn Lily Audrey Skilton aged 14""; ""Robyn took her own life""; ""tied a ligature around her neck""; ""awaiting a formal assessment by a child psychiatrist""; ""initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services (CAMHS)""",True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 January 2022.","Danny was a vulnerable teenager: he had left home and was living in hostel accommodation; he had changed his GP practice; he was trans, had changed his name and had been referred to the Gender Identity Clinic; he had recently been discharged from secondary mental health services in Suffolk and had been referred to mental health services in Cambridge; he had previously been under CAMHS and was now being referred to adult mental health services; he had diagnoses of anxiety and depression and had been prescribed medication; he had made previous suicide attempts and had long term suicidal thoughts; he had sought counselling from IAPT but this was declined because he was considered too high risk; he had been assessed by First Response Service but had been considered as not requiring urgent intervention.

Safeguarding referrals about Danny were made to Cambridgeshire County Council in October 2019 and January 2020. Both referrals were closed and it was accepted that the decision to close both referrals was incorrect.

In December 2019 Danny’s new GP referred him to Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT). He had been seen by the Primary Care Mental Health Services but was still awaiting assessment by the Adult Locality Team at the time of his death.","My concern in this case is that a vulnerable young person can be known to the County Council and Mental Health Trust and yet not receive the support they need pending substantive treatment. Danny was repeatedly assessed as not meeting the criteria for urgent intervention and yet the waiting list for psychological therapy was likely to be over a year from point of first presentation. That gap between urgent and non-urgent services is potentially dangerous for a vulnerable young person, where there is a chronic risk of an impulsive act. I understand that there is a long term plan to extend young people’s services to age 25, but I remain concerned about the ongoing situation, and that a young person today could be faced with the same challenges in finding support pending substantive treatment.

I believe this concern is the combined responsibility of Cambridgeshire County Council and CPFT. These organisations may wish to consult in preparing their response to this report.

The inquest heard evidence about the considerable delay in obtaining appointments for the Gender Identity Clinic, and about the shortage of availability for psychological therapies such as CBT. These are matters for policy and funding.

Davies,Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly,"Chief Executive Officer, Youth Justice Board for England and Wales","On 14 September 2020 an investigation commenced into the death of 16-year-old Jake Adam Cahill. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 January 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows

Medical cause of death:

1(a) Hanging

The four questions - who, when, where and how – were answered as follows:

Jake Adam Cahill died on 14 September 2020 at [REDACTED] Cornwall by being an impulsive act in a moment of crisis, that was wholly unexpected and could not have been anticipated.

Short form conclusion:

Suicide","Jake had been subject to police investigations for a minor criminal offence committed in March 2020. The police issued a conditional caution which was administered on 4 September 2020. Jake was clearly upset at being issued with a police caution and having conditions imposed. Subsequently the local youth offender service (YOS) sent Jake’s mother, [REDACTED], some documents for completion. This included a self-assessment form, being a document produced by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales. The letter from the YOS instructed [REDACTED] to pass that self-assessment form to Jake for completion. [REDACTED] handed this form to Jake late in the evening of 13 September. The form was written in the first person and three questions were highlighted at Inquest, with a yes/no box for completion

• I have thought about hurting myself
• I have tried to hurt myself
• I have thought about killing myself

Jake ticked ‘no’ for each of these questions. The following day Jake took his own life.

In connection with the self-assessment form there was no evidence of any consideration being given to the need for sensitive questions raised in the form to be discussed with Jake by a professional before Jake completed the form.

Evidence was taken from police on the subject of the risk assessment forms used by police. These forms do include questions whether an individual intends to harm or kill themselves. This form is never sent to individuals but is always completed by the individual with an officer present, that officer being required to explain and if necessary, contextualise the questions.

The court heard that the guidance to the self-assessment form issued by the Youth Justice Board makes no express reference to the need for consideration to be given and documented as to whether the self-assessment form needs to be discussed with a vulnerable young person before completion of the form. The guidance examined at the Inquest was a document entitled ‘AssetPlus guidance v2.0’.

Jake had no history of any mental health conditions, or any history of self-harm or suicidal ideation. There was no evidence from friends and family of any warning sign as to Jake’s state of mind.

Toxicological examination was negative, in other words no drugs or alcohol were found in samples of blood taken from Jake after death.

The police investigation had searched through Jake’s browsing history. That enquiry revealed nothing of concern until the day of Jake’s death 14 September 2020, by way of image caches captured on his browsing history as follows

• 0650 I’m so done with everything
• 0713 Do you just deep how alone u truly are sometimes
• 1027 I want to die by hanging myself. How do I make sure that it works? Will it hurt?

I made a finding of fact that the completion of that self-assessment form late on 13 September contributed to a moment of crisis for Jake the following day 14 September during which he took his life.","(1) That there was no evidence of any consideration being given to the need for sensitive issues raised in the self-assessment form to be discussed with Jake by a professional before Jake completed the form.

(2) That the guidance to the self-assessment form issued by the Youth Justice Board makes no express reference to the need for consideration to be given and documented as to whether the form should be discussed with a vulnerable young person before completion.","""16-year-old Jake Adam Cahill""; ""Short form conclusion: Suicide""; ""Jake took his own life""",True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

Travers,Surrey,Chief Executive Officer of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust; Chief Executive Officer of Surrey County Council; Chief Executive Officer of Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group; Chair of the National Child Safeguarding Review Panel; Secretary of State for Education; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,"I commenced an investigation into the death of Oskar Miles Nash. The inquest concluded on 10 September 2021 when I found that the medical cause of death was -
Ia Multiple traumatic injuries
and my conclusion as to the death was that -
Oskar Nash died as a result of suicide contributed to by neglect on the part of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.
Oskar Nash’s death was more than minimally contributed to by the failures of :
(i) Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service :
To undertake a clinical assessment of Oskar’s mental and emotional health at any stage, despite a series of requests for them to do so, and a consequential failure to diagnose, treat, monitor and otherwise support Oskar as necessary, in order to minimise his risk of suicide.
(ii) Surrey County Council’s Special Educational Needs Department :
(a) To ensure that Oskar’s Educational, Health and Care Plan contained sufficient and updated information about his mental and emotional health needs and his risk of suicidal ideation, and the provision required to meet those needs, and
(b) To place Oskar in an appropriate school, rather than in March 2019 his inappropriate placement in a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs.
(iii) Surrey County Council’s Children’s Services Department and Targeted Youth Support Team :
(a) To complete the required assessments following Oskar’s referral in November 2019, and to provide any effective intervention or support, and
(b) To reallocate the management of his case to a registered social worker following escalation of Oskar’s risk level in the course of November 2019.
(iv) St Dominic’s School and Cobham Free School :
To ensure that there was a sufficient sharing of information about Oskar’s history, special needs and current situation, prior to his transfer from a special needs school to a mainstream school in March 2019.
I subsequently held a hearing to receive evidence relating to the prevention of future deaths and this was concluded on 7 December 2021, with time allowed subsequently for written submissions.","Oskar Nash was 14 years old when he died. He had been diagnosed with autism at the age of 4 years and he suffered associated high anxiety throughout his life. It is likely that he also had one or more undiagnosed emotional or mental health condition(s). Oskar had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both of which receded when his needs were sufficiently supported.
Oskar was well known to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service and to Children’s Services, having been the subject of a number of referrals to both. His education was managed by the Special Educational Needs Department of his local authority as he had been issued with an Educational, Health and Care Plan. All state agencies concerned with Oskar had knowledge of his history of suicidal ideation.
In March 2019 Oskar transferred from a special needs school to a mainstream school. Initially he appeared to cope, but from early November 2019 onwards, he regularly refused to attend school and a period of escalating risk followed. Referrals were made to CAMHS and Children’s Services but Oskar did not receive any effective support.
On 9 January 2020, Oskar Nash gained access to an area of [REDACTED] [REDACTED] and, a short time later, at about 17.06 hours, he deliberately moved [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. His body was found the following morning.
Full details of the events and failings which lead to Oskar Nash’s death are set out in my “Factual Findings and Conclusions” document, a copy of which is sent with this report.","A. Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust
Concern 1
The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff responsible for the triage of referrals to child mental health services had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I have been told that the triaging process is now undertaken by an “Access and Advice Team” but I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff in that Team to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis.
Concern 2
The evidence at the inquest revealed that, despite a series of referrals to child mental health services over many years, Oskar Nash never received the clinical assessment he needed. I have been told that the system now in place ought to result in a child such as Oskar being seen and assessed by a clinical team. I am satisfied that the introduction of the Access and Advice Team, in the context of the new Mindworks service, is intended to ensure that a referred child’s needs are properly identified and met.
However, on the basis of the evidence I heard at the prevention of future deaths hearing, including from a special needs school which has experience of referring its pupils, I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that some referrals may be inappropriately closed (for example because the child, at an early stage, declines to engage) or inappropriately referred to non-clinical partner agencies. In this context, I am concerned that there is a lack of specific monitoring of what proportion of referred children reach a clinical team and the extent to which the outcomes match the expectations of the referrers (so that any ongoing “barriers” in the system, which may be preventing proper access to the clinical teams, can then be identified and eliminated).
Concern 3
The evidence showed that a referral to the child mental health services is triaged initially as being crisis, urgent, priority or routine. The criteria for crisis, urgent and priority referrals are specific and narrow and, consequently, the great majority of referrals are categorised as routine. I have been told that the routine referrals are automatically categorised as “low risk”. I am concerned about this as it is clear from the evidence that a child may not meet the criteria crisis, urgent or priority but, like Oskar Nash, may nevertheless be at a high or medium risk of harm. The Trust is currently receiving a high volume of referrals and so there is a considerable waiting time for its “routine” cases to be addressed. It seems inevitable, therefore, that there are children in this category who have been wrongly assumed to be at low risk of harm but who, in fact, face a high risk of harm which is currently unrecognised and unmanaged.
Concern 4
I was told that the Standard Operating Procedure manual for the triage of referrals to children’s mental health services is to be updated to reflect the Trust’s new working practices but that this has not yet been done. I am concerned that important changes to the system of work (for example, the vital requirement that a referred child’s records are reviewed before any triaging decision is made and the child/family are spoken to) are not yet established in written guidance.
Concern 5
The evidence at the inquest showed that the clinicians who were responsible for ensuring that Oskar Nash’s medical conditions, including his risk of self-harm and suicide, and his consequential needs, were properly and sufficiently recorded in his Education, Health and Care Plan, failed to do so; this was in part because they did not fully understand their role and obligations in this regard.
On the basis of the evidence at the prevention of future deaths hearing, I am concerned that there continues to be a lack of understanding amongst the clinicians currently providing medical advice as part of the EHCP process as to their role in that process. I am further concerned that there is in place no programme for the training or monitoring of these clinicians in relation to these responsibilities.
B. Surrey County Council (and National)
(i) Education and Special Educational Needs Department
Concern 6
The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in the Education / SEN Department, including SEN caseworkers, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis.
Concern 7
The evidence at the inquest showed that, in the months before his death, Oskar Nash was moved from a special needs school and placed into a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs. I found that the inappropriate placement, by SCC, of Oskar into the mainstream school contributed to his death.
Prior to the placement, the mainstream school had been provided with Oskar’s Educational, Health and Care Plan, but this failed adequately to identify and record his mental and emotional health concerns, his risk of suicidal ideation, his consequential needs, and the provision required to meet those needs, and it had not been updated to reflect a series of subsequent reviews of the Plan and significant subsequent events. The mainstream school was not provided with any of the extensive and informative records from the special needs school from which he was being moved.
I was told by the mainstream school that, had they seen the records held by his special needs school, they would have recognised their inability to meet his needs and informed the SEN Department accordingly.
At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that it continues to be the case that a prospective school will usually be provided by the SEN Department with the child’s EHCP only. Further, it was apparent that there is a lack of clarity as to the extent to which a current school may or should provide records or information to a prospective school.
I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that placements of children with EHCPs are being made on the basis of inadequate information and record sharing. On the evidence before me, it was clear that, even if an EHCP were comprehensive and fully updated (which may not be the case), it is unlikely to contain all matters of relevance to the question of a prospective school’s ability to meet the child’s needs.
I was given no good reason why fuller information and record sharing, sufficient to ensure that the prospective school can properly assess its ability to meet the child’s needs, should not take place before any child with an EHCP is placed in a new school. I am concerned that there is no system in place, locally or nationally, to ensure this is achieved by the relevant SEN department for every child with an EHCP. I am also concerned that there is an ongoing lack of clarity as to schools’ powers and duties to share information and documents, and any data protection ramifications this may have.
(ii) Children’s Services Department
Concern 8
The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in SCC’s Children’s Services Department, including Social Workers and other Team members, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis.
Concern 9
At the inquest I found that following Oskar Nash’s final referral to SCC’s Children’s Services Department, which was made approximately two months before his death, there was a failure to appreciate the seriousness of his situation and the risks arising, and a consequential failure to allocate his case appropriately. I found that this contributed to his death. The inappropriate allocation resulted, in part, from the application of SCC’s then “threshold of needs” document, which was used to inform the level at which support should be provided.
At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence about SCC’s revised “threshold of needs” document, as well as the recent guidance (including a “toolbox”) in relation to suicidality, which has been introduced since Oskar’s death.
Despite these changes, I remain concerned that the “threshold of needs” document does not adequately and clearly reflect the known risks of mental health difficulties, self-harm, and suicidal ideation for autistic children (given their prevalence in this group of children) and that, consequentially, there is an ongoing risk that an autistic child in these circumstances will be allocated an insufficient level of support, as was the case for Oskar.
C. Surrey County Council and Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group (and National)
Concern 10
At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence concerning the post-death reviews conducted into Oskar Nash’s death by the Surrey Child Death Review Partnership Team and the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership. The evidence showed that neither process resulted in a sufficient or effective investigation of the death; I consider that the evidence shows that fact finding was superficial, there was no meaningful analysis of the part played by statutory agencies in the causation of his death, and only very limited learning was identified.
Ineffective review by the child death review processes results in the risk of further deaths in similar circumstances and I am concerned that the local and/or national process, guidance and oversight are insufficient to ensure that an effective post-death investigation, which should not be dependent on the inquest process, is achieved in all cases.
D. National Issues
Concern 11
From the evidence I heard at the inquest and the prevention of future deaths hearing, it was apparent that the national “Working Together” guidance focuses on children who are in need of safeguarding by reason of risks within the home or from other parental failures to keep the child safe. It was apparent that the consequential approach tends to look critically at the child’s family and parent(s) and their parenting skills, and that this is likely to be inappropriate if the child is in need through disability. I consider that this had a detrimental impact on the approach of agencies to Oskar and his family.
I am concerned that “Working Together” does not provide clearer guidance specifically for the safeguarding of children with disabilities, including Autism, and the approach to be taken by agencies to parents and families.
Concern 12
The evidence at the inquest revealed a widespread lack of knowledge and understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. There was a lack of training across all the state agencies from which I heard. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence of more training being available, but also of an ongoing absence of comprehensive, relevant and mandatory training.
I was told that the National Autism Strategy does not currently include a timetabled commitment for relevant mandatory Autism training to be provided to all state agencies working directly with autistic adults and children.
I am concerned that this poses an ongoing risk to autistic children and their ability to access the services they require for their support, welfare, and safeguarding.","""Oskar Nash was 14 years old when he died""; ""my conclusion as to the death was that - Oskar Nash died as a result of suicide""",True,True,True,False,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False

The medical cause of death given was:

1a. Suspension

I returned a conclusion of [REDACTED] with Frankie’s death more than minimally contributed to by the failures of:

1. Stepping Stone School:

a. To provide an effective e-security system as tasked to do so by the Department of Education.
b. To ensure Frankie’s use of the iPad was monitored to confirm her [REDACTED] safety.
c. To provide Frankie with supervision when not attending lessons despite having an Educational Health Care Plan in place.

2. [REDACTED]:

a. A lack of robustness in their policies to remove age inappropriate [REDACTED] content that allowed Frankie to read stories on their platform on the day of her death featuring [REDACTED], an act which she goes on to complete herself.","Frances Rose Thomas (Frankie) was a vulnerable teenager with a number of significant underlying difficulties including childhood trauma, high functioning autism, oppositional behaviour and impulsivity.

Stepping Stones School is a school for students with moderate physical or learning difficulties. Frankie was offered a place in year 8 and started in April 2016 with an Educational Care Plan in place. Throughout her time at the school Frankie often refused to attend lessons and at the time of her death rarely attended more than one lesson a week. When not attending lessons, she was left on her own without any formal supervision. During this time, she had access to a school computer and an iPad.

During the inquest I heard evidence Frankie only had access to the [REDACTED] during school time using electronic devices supplied by the school. There was an e-security system in place for school computers but it was not monitored by nominated safeguarding leads. This allowed Frankie (as it did for all students) to freely access the [REDACTED] without any observation as to what websites were being accessed and for an assessment to be made of their appropriateness. Furthermore, the iPads had no e-security system in place at all, again allowing Frankie to freely access the [REDACTED] without any supervision.

On the day of her death, Frankie was found to have accessed [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
The stories that Frankie accessed on this platform featured [REDACTED]. After school Frankie went home and undertook a similar act resulting in her death on 25 September 2018.","1. I heard evidence that the Department of Education have devolved responsibility for e-security systems with schools having to tender for web filtering software and hardware. However, the guidelines issued by the Department of Education require updating and are insufficiently robust to ensure their effectiveness and meet the changing demands of [REDACTED] e-security in schools.

2. There is a wide range of software vendors providing different lists of blocklists with different vendors enabling different categories with no oversight or regulatory guidance by the Department of Education as to what blocklists are either acceptable and/or suitable for a school environment.

3. [REDACTED] is not a specifically blocked [REDACTED] and not only can it be accessed by Key Stage 4 students there is encouragement to do so in some schools. However, I heard evidence that the sites Frankie accessed through [REDACTED]. Furthermore, there is inadequate independent scrutiny by [REDACTED] to remove age inappropriate stories put on their platform.

4. Some websites are only blocked when there is a particular key word in the URL. If the relevant trigger word (e.g. [REDACTED]) is not there it makes it difficult for the filter to see the content of the website to be able to block it, hence why stories on [REDACTED] could be read. However, there are software systems available that act as a key logger and screen reader. Whilst this will not block the site it will generate a report to the nominated safeguarding individual for further action. Yet it has not been considered or is part of the guidelines issued by the Department of Education.

Hayes,Kent Mid and Medway,Chief Executive Officer North East London NHS Foundation Trust – Child & Adult Mental Health Services,On 14 October 2020 an investigation was commenced into the death of ELEANOR ROSE MURPHY-RICHARDS otherwise ELLIS MURPHY-RICHARDS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 June 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,"Ellis died on 30 September 2020 at Brielle Way, Sheerness, Kent of multiple traumatic injuries not compatible with life. Concerned bystanders on a footbridge between Queensbury and Sheerness Stations spoke to Ellis for about five minutes but he refused to climb back to safety. He jumped from the footbridge onto a railway track into the path of an oncoming train with the intention of ending his life, at approximately 16:41.

Ellis had a history of self-harm and suicidal ideation including thoughts of and attempts to end his life by overdose, ligatures and with attempts to jump from a footbridge and in front of an oncoming train that required informal admission to hospital for approximately four months. Ellis had been diagnosed with depression and emotional instability and continued to have episodes of self-harm and thoughts of suicide. Ellis was under the care of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service on discharge in June 2020, with support from Assessment and Liaison Outreach and had an agreed safety plan in place that included Ellis attend Accident and Emergency at hospital if he could not keep himself safe, even with the support of others. Ellis engaged with community mental health services, was taking prescribed medication, disclosed thoughts of suicide and did seek support to keep himself safe.

Ellis was rescued from an attempt to hang himself at home on the night of 29 September and had planned telephone psychiatric review the next morning with details of the failed attempt, that Ellis wanted to kill himself and could not keep himself safe. The psychiatrist instructed Ellis and his family to attend a pre-scheduled appointment at 15:00 with his care coordinator. This was a deviation from the safety plan that was not risk assessed and the care coordinator was provided with limited information of a self-harm attempt. When Ellis was assessed at the Seashells Unit he was found to be suicidal requiring a mental health assessment for admission to hospital. The care coordinator sought advice from her manager about the plan should Ellis refuse to go to hospital and was informed that she should call the police. Ellis refused to go to hospital and insisted he did not want to live and left the centre, leaving behind his telephone and tablet device so he could not be contacted. The care coordinator telephoned the police at approximately 16:05 who reported Ellis was missing and at imminent risk of killing himself and that he may attempt to travel by train to Faversham, his risks associated with jumping from bridges and in front of trains was not shared. The police updated British Transport Police at 16:28 that Ellis may attempt to board to go to Faversham.","(1) Ellis’s Safety Plan did not set out:
    a. the responsibilities of the Child & Adolescent Mental Health Team
    b. did not contain a contingency plan should Ellis agree to go to Accident & Emergency

Marsh,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton",A2Dominion,"On 27 January 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Kesia Blaine Waller, aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 May 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was cause of death: 1(a) hypoxic brain injury and 1(b) hanging. Short form conclusions of suicide.","At around 21:09 on 20 January 2020 Kesia Blaine Waller was discovered suspended from a ligature at her home address of [REDACTED] City Road, Winchester. She was taken to SGH where she was discovered to have a catastrophic hypoxic brain injury. Further treatment was deemed futile and life-sustaining treatment was withdrawn. Kesia sadly died in hospital on 25 January 2020.","At Kesia’s inquest I heard that her place of residence, City Road in Winchester, was a residential housing unit for vulnerable young people aged 16-21. The facility meets a housing need only for the young persons placed there. It was found on the evidence that A2 Dominion employees did not have sufficient training or tools (i.e. implements) in place to prepare staff for the situation that they faced on 20 January 2020 when they found Kesia hanging in her room, nor could they carry out any physical actions to assist her (i.e. cut her down). There appeared to be no prior appreciation of the risk(s) of self-harm, overdose or attempted suicide of residents, and so on discovering Kesia suspended in her room, the staff were inadequately prepared on multiple levels.

(a) I heard that whilst there has been additional training for the staff on areas of risk such as self-harm, overdose and/or suicide, there have been no physical changes in terms of the provision of tools and implements that staff could use should they be confronted by a young person in distress and/or in need of life-saving attention. It appears to me that without multi-factorial changes there remains a real and significant risk that staff at the residential units will remain unable to take any immediate and potentially life-saving action. The only tools and equipment that remain supplied is a standard home-style first aid kit which is entirely ineffective if a young person has suspended themselves from a ligature.

(b) Although additional training and courses have been added to both the induction training and ongoing professional development of staff within the residential units similar to City Road, I remain concerned by the way in which key policies and training are communicated and implemented as this does not appear to have changed. It was clear from the evidence that updates to policies are emailed to employees with a request that the employee responds to the email to confirm receipt. This proved to be wholly ineffective as what appeared to be expected by the company was that the employee would read, digest and understand the policy, and confirm when he/she had done so. The employee on duty on 20 January 2020 was clearly unfamiliar with the appropriate policies and had only confirmed that he had received the email (which appeared to be all that was required) and not that he had actually read, digested and understood the appropriate policy/ies; how to apply them in practice and what was reasonably expected of him. Although enhanced risk training is now in place, it appears to me that without any enhanced diligence to ensure that policies are actually read and understood by those working face-to-face with the vulnerable young adults then the overall effectiveness of risk training and identification is severely flawed.","""Kesia Blaine Waller, aged 17""; ""Short form conclusions of suicide""",True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Moss,Cambridgeshire and Peterborough,The Royal Pharmaceutical Society; The General Pharmaceutical Council; The Company Chemists’ Association; NHS England,"An investigation commenced on 13 September 2018 into the death of SAMANTHA JANE GOULD (Sam) aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 April 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was: • Sam died by suicide by an overdose of prescribed medication. • The main cause of Sam’s death was her borderline personality disorder, which treating clinicians assessed to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood. The disorder caused a persistent but unpredictable and fluctuating risk of serious deliberate self-harm and suicide. • There was a wider narrative conclusion, the aspect most relevant to this report being that: “There was a systemic weakness and failing in the lack of a protocol for [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service – CAMHS] and the GP service to communicate with local pharmacies concerning 16-18 year old patients with mental health conditions who were at risk of deliberate overdose. Sam was therefore able to pick up older prescriptions on 1 September 2018 without challenge. It was those medications … that were fatal in the combined amounts Sam ingested on the night of 1-2 September 2018.”","There was a safety plan agreed with Sam’s consultant psychiatrist whereby, although Sam was over the age of 16, Sam’s parents would be responsible for her medication. On 30 August 2018, Sam’s treating psychiatrist in the community made a change to Sam’s medication giving her a paper prescription. Sam expressed a preference to tell her mother about the change in medication (new prescription of Topiramate) directly and the psychiatrist had to make a judgement call whether or not to breach medical confidence and tell Sam’s mother about this directly. On balance she chose not to. In the event, Sam did not tell her mother about the new prescription. Shortly before 1 pm on Saturday 1 September 2018, Sam instead went to her local pharmacy with the prescription for Topiramate and Lorazepam. She collected those medications as well as older prescriptions for other medications she would previously not have known were being held there. At her home on School Lane, Fulbourn at some time after 01.23 on the morning of 2 September 2018, Sam took a very large quantity of some of the prescribed medications. She went to bed, fell unconscious and died within at most a couple of hours. The local pharmacy (who do not have access to patients’ records on SystmOne) had not been told about the safety plan. As Sam was 16 years old, she was assumed competent to take her own prescriptions and the pharmacists had no immediate reason not to provide them to Sam, being ignorant of the safety plan.","(1) There did not appear to be any national guidance or standards that directed or encouraged appropriate sharing of risk information and care plans with the local pharmacy. As a result, the pharmacy was unsighted on the fact that the treating psychiatric team had a safety plan involving Sam’s parents being responsible for handling and administering all medication. Had the pharmacy been aware of this plan, it is likely that they would either have refused to provide the medication with which Sam overdosed or, at least, contacted Sam’s parents or General Practitioner.

(2) A local protocol has now been introduced whereby the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ensures that any pharmacy used regularly by their patients aged 16-17 are (where appropriate) advised of relevant care plans, as well as the responsible GP being so informed. This is now to be part of mandatory training for CAMHS prescribing staff and is to be discussed in the local Joint Prescribing Group to ensure better communication between the local NHS Trusts, G.P.s and local pharmacies. Accordingly, action has already been taken in the local area to prevent similar fatalities.

However,

(3) I am concerned that there is a risk of future fatalities if action is not taken at a national level to ensure that pharmacies are appropriately involved in medication safety plans for mental health patients aged 16–17, given that such patients may otherwise be able to obtain prescribed medication with which to overdose.","""SAMANTHA JANE GOULD (Sam) aged 16""; ""Sam died by suicide by an overdose of prescribed medication""",True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Moss,Cambridgeshire and Peterborough,British Transport Police; Network Rail,"An investigation commenced on 5 February 2019 into the death of Christine Elizabeth Gould (Chris) aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 May 2021.

• The conclusion of the inquest was that Chris died by suicide when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train on 26 January 2019.

• Box 3 of the record of inquest recorded that:
“Chris was an informal patient at the Darwin Unit for Young People, Fulbourn, Cambridge. Shortly after 6.30 pm on Saturday 26 January 2019, she was permitted to leave the hospital for a cigarette break. She did not return to the unit as expected, but instead went to the nearby railway line. At about 7.35 pm Chris died when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train, approximately 150 metres to the east of the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing”

• I gave a wider narrative conclusion together with factual findings delivered in open court. My narrative conclusion included that:
“Given the proximity of the Darwin Unit (and also the Fulbourn Hospital) and previous trespass incidents involving vulnerable patients:
(i) Network Rail had made available a suitable and valuable facility for direct communication between CPFT and the signallers to slow the trains.
(ii) Network Rail’s fencing between and around the Cherry Hinton Bypass and Teversham Level Crossings was less than optimal. However, it would be mere speculation to conclude that this contributed to Chris’ death.”","My factual findings included that Chris may have accessed the railway line from the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing, from the Teversham Level Crossing or through or over the boundary fence between those level crossings. My factual findings further included that:

1) Network Rail had too readily assumed that Chris had accessed the railway via the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing.

2) Both BTP and Network Rail fell into error in promoting that from a credible hypothesis into a firm assumption.
3) Network Rail in written evidence had gone so far as to state that “Access was made by Ms Gould at the crossing not via boundary [fencing]”. There was no proper basis for such a firm assertion of Chris’ route of access and this detracted from the otherwise careful evidence provided to the Court by Network Rail.
4) While compliant with standards, the fencing of the lower Class II type between the two level crossings near the Darwin Units should have been considered for upgrading given the proximity of the mental health units and the frequency of trespass incidents.
5) The boundary fencing at the time of Chris’ death was less than optimal given the known risks.
6) It is to Network Rail’s credit that they have now proactively decided to install 1.8m palisade fencing across the whole boundary area.
7) The annual inspections reporting the fencing as being in good condition did not appear to have captured the frequent cases of damage to the top line of the fencing. Such damage may not have rendered the fencing as in poor condition, but it pointed to trespassing incidents which ought to have been fed back into the risk assessments for the area.
8) In combination, the number of trespass incidents, and the frequent top-line level damage to the fencing should have led to the conclusion that the boundary measure was not preventing trespass. That should have led, but did not in fact lead, to the boundary fence being inspected every three months rather than annually.
9) I noted that Network Rail had already indicated in evidence that it would in future be inspecting the fence boundary every three months.","(1) Following completed suicides on the railway network BTP and Network Rail are both involved in considering further mitigating measures that may be appropriate at the location to guard against further fatalities.
(2) In Chris’ case, earlier consideration to the fence boundary being a credible route of access may have led to the fence boundary being improved more quickly after her death.
(3) I am concerned that your investigation into, and consideration of, Chris’ death did not keep a sufficiently open mind that she may have climbed the boundary fence to access the railway line. If similar assumptions are made in other investigations, there is a risk of future fatalities: there is a risk that mitigating measures will be missed if BTP and Network Rail too readily assume that one point of access to the railway was used when the evidence permits of credible alternative routes of access.

Accordingly, I am concerned that action should be taken in the sphere of guidance in keeping an open mind in post-death investigations but the nature of any appropriate action to be taken is for your organisations to consider.","""Christine Elizabeth Gould (Chris) aged 17""; ""Chris died by suicide when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train on 26 January 2019.""",True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

Nieto,Derby and Derbyshire,"The Rt Hon Gavin Williamson CBE MP, Secretary of State for Education; Department for Education","On 17 July 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacob Andrew Bates (dob: 5 January 2000; dod: 15 July 2017). The investigation concluded by way of an inquest hearing from 2 to 5 December 2019 (a copy of the record of inquest is enclosed with the covering letter to this report). My findings at inquest were as follows: -

- Medical cause of death: -
1a Ligature around the neck.
1b Mental health issues and autism.

- Summary of circumstances: -
Jacob died as a result of placing plastic ties around his neck as ligatures. Although he had not given any immediate indication to anyone that he was contemplating taking his own life he was assessed as being at on-going risk of serious self-harm. Due to the nature of the act, his self-harm history, the on-going assessed risk, and his leaving of a 'suicide' note I found that he had undertaken a deliberate act with the intention of taking his own life. Just prior to his death a six month unregulated placement had recently been ended, and prior to that placement he had spent over two and a half years in a succession of secure placements.

- On the evidence I did not find that factors associated with the unregulated placement had directly contributed to Jacob's death.

- My conclusion as to Jacob's death was a short form conclusion of suicide.","Jacob had diagnoses of autism and mental health problems. Following a serious overdose in February 2014 he was thereafter placed in a succession of secure placements under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983 and the Children Act 1989 until he returned to his home area of Chesterfield around Christmas 2016 when he was placed, under the provisions of s.20 Children Act 1989, in an unregulated placement for young people aged between 16 and 18 years of age and was also supported by local authority social care and child and adolescent mental health services. The Chesterfield placement was not a specialist placement for young people with autism or mental health problems and the placement had been made in the context of a specialist placement having given very short notice of termination of placement. There had been many episodes of self-harm following the overdose in February, some serious, including just two months prior to his death and he was assessed at on-going risk of serious self-harm. The Chesterfield placement came to an end following Jacob's decision to move in to live with his father where he received on-going support from the agencies.","1. Vulnerable young people, aged 16 to 18, are being placed in unregulated placements.

2. Any young person under the age of 18 placed in an unregulated placement is likely to have very significant vulnerabilities, and it is likely that young people with complex needs and at significant risk are being placed in such placements; indeed this was the case for Jacob.

3. As the placements are unregulated there are no statutory regulations to comply with relating to competency and appropriate policies and procedures by the provider and there is no regulatory body to check and assess those providers. This is clearly a very concerning situation given the very high level needs that some of the young people will have.

4. The lack of statutory regulation then places an onus on local authorities to check that a provider is competent and safe. Whilst in making individual placements it must be the duty of a local authority to satisfy itself as best as it is able that placements are 'safe', given the pressures on local authorities it cannot be the case that they are in a position to mirror the type and nature of inspection and oversight that might be provided by a regulator such as Ofsted.

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,College of Policing; Secretary of State for Education; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,On 17 January 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Katie Croft. The investigation concluded on 17 October 2019 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) Severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy; 1b) Asphyxia from hanging,"Katie Croft was a vulnerable child who was a victim of abuse which she reported. On 17 October 2018 Greater Manchester Police and Tameside Children’s Services began an investigation. Katie was spoken to by both agencies having already given a detailed account to her school, which had reported the disclosure. The working together principles applied to the investigation which require that the voice of the child should be a focus for all agencies.

Subsequently Katie via her mother indicated she did not want to support a prosecution. The case was closed by Greater Manchester Police without being countersigned by a supervisor or any further face to face discussion with Katie or assessment of the evidence. A multi-agency strategy meeting was held and concluded Katie was being safeguarded. A child and family assessment was subsequently completed by an agency social worker from Children’s Services without any further discussion with Katie. It was not shared with Katie or her family.

On 18 December 2018 Katie disclosed to her form teacher that she was considering self-harm or worse. A cause for concern form was completed but subsequently misplaced. Action was taken to notify her parents of Katie’s disclosure and her mother was spoken to. Katie had previously self-harmed. No further action was taken in relation to this disclosure. On 8 January 2019 Katie sent her previous form teacher, who had left the school, a message via social media. She said she had no one else to talk to who knew what she was feeling and that she thought about the abuse every day and had cut herself the day before. The message was shared with the school safeguarding lead that evening and Katie was spoken to at school the following day. She denied sending the message.

She continued with lessons. School attempted to notify her family of the concern. After school she returned home. As a result of concerns raised by one of her friends school were contacted and contact was made with her family who tried to contact her and check on her wellbeing. Her friend went to check on her and found Katie suspended from a ligature at her home address.

She was resuscitated and taken to hospital. However she had sustained catastrophic brain damage and died at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital on 15 January 2019.","1. The inquest was told that GMP followed their own guidance which accorded with that of the College of Policing into the level of expertise of the officer allocated to investigate Katie’s allegations. As a result of this the case was not dealt with by an experienced Public Protection or specialist sexual offences trained officer. It was allocated to a probationary police constable with approximately 6 months experience. The officer did not seize the phone which contained key social media contents until her third visit on the initial evening the offence was disclosed. The allocated officer was not experienced in joint working with social services or familiar with the concept of the voice of the child and what it would mean in such a case. At the time the decision was made by police to NFA matters there was no discussion about whether there could be a victimless prosecution; it was not established if the initial account was recorded on body worn footage or the extent of the social media contact by the suspect and the nature of any offences that could be revealed by those messages. No attempt was made to have a further face to face conversation with Katie;

2. The Local Authority at the time were using a substantial number of agency social workers. As a result the Child and Family Assessment was not completed in accordance with best practice and not shared in accordance with expectations around best practice. The Local Authority has since made significant progress in moving away from a reliance on agency staff to fill gaps in social work cover. The inquest was told that agency social workers are still used extensively in other Local Authorities creating a risk that a similar situation could arise;

3. At the safeguarding strategy meeting an officer allocated to attend such meetings on behalf of GMP attended rather than an officer allocated to the case. As a result the quality of information sharing and understanding of the allegation was more limited. On the particular police division in question this practice has stopped. It was unclear how common the approach is on a wider basis;

4. It was accepted by witnesses for both the Local Authority and GMP that the voice of the child was not fully heard throughout their investigations. They via the safeguarding board commissioned an independent report whose findings and recommendations have been fully adopted by the safeguarding board. It was unclear what if any steps would be taken to disseminate the lessons pan GM or nationally;

5. A further concern identified was that there was no mechanism for the school to be formally be aware of information within the Child and Family Assessment. As a result there was no formal follow-up procedure set out in the best practice national guidance the school was working within. The inquest heard that Katie’s school recognising this gap has built on the working together guidance to develop guidance that ensures there is a proactive approach to engaging with a child and their family post the writing of a Child and Family Assessment;

6. On the day Katie committed suicide she had attended a GCSE English class. The exam board required poetry syllabus was being studied that day. The lesson included a poem where the contextualisation of it included the use of suicide. The teacher delivering the lesson had no way of understanding the history of self-harm of Katie and her particular vulnerability when delivering a set text in accordance with the exam board requirements. It was unclear what if any guidance is given by the exam board to assist teachers minimising risk to pupils in this scenario.","""the conclusion was one of suicide""; ""Katie Croft was a vulnerable child""; ""her school""; ""Children’s Services""; ""Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital""; ""GCSE English class""",True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,Secretary of State for Health; Secretary of State for Education; Chief Executive of Stockport Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG); Greater Manchester Health & Social Care Partnership,On 18 October 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Oliver Sharp. The investigation concluded on 20 September 2019 and the conclusion was one of: Narrative: Suicide contributed to by a failure by mental health services to recognise the increasing level of risk he presented as he transitioned from child and adolescent mental health services into the reduced provision and support available post 16.,"Oliver Richard Sharp was a year ahead of his chronological age at school and excelled academically. Whilst at Manchester Grammar School he began to change his approach to school and his friends. He disclosed to a CBT therapist the extent of how he was struggling with how he felt about himself and his friendships. On 17 April 2016 he disclosed he was self-harming. On 21 April 2016 he saw the GP and was referred to CAMHS. On 25 April 2016 Oliver took 48 paracetamol tablets and disclosed that to his family who took him to Stepping Hill Hospital. He returned to school and continued under CAMHS. He was put on a 6 month waiting list for an ADOS assessment, which took place in November 2016 and was inconclusive.

In September 2016 he returned to year 11 at Manchester Grammar School. He was struggling to cope with the academic demands and there was a focus on trying to help him catch up academically and keep him safe. He showed signs of becoming concerned about failing and struggled to cope with friendship groups. The delayed ADOS assessment indicated he was not autistic.

He continued to self-harm over Christmas 2016, and on 2 January 2017 he took an overdose of paracetamol and was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital. It was agreed with CAMHS that a second opinion would be sought about him. The psychiatric assessment identified a complex picture including difficulties with emotional literacy and empathy. The overall diagnosis was of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ADHD and Emotional Behavioural Dysregulation.

Following his January overdose, work continued with CAMHS and he returned to school. He became increasingly isolated and by the time of GCSEs he took only English and Maths but did not answer the papers. He left Manchester Grammar School and transferred to Beech Hall School in September 2017, dropping back to a year below his chronological age to repeat year 10. Over summer 2017 he began to work with the Autism Team and they helped support him into Beech Hall School.

In October 2017 he went missing from home and was found on a motorway bridge at 5am. He had not been taking his medication. Family therapy and sessions with his case manager continued. There were discussions about post 16 provision as he approached his 16th birthday. CAMHS within Stockport is a service for children up to 16. Discussions regarding discharge continued and because of the way in which Mental Health Services were structured the plan was to discharge to the GP. Overall he had settled at Beech Hall, although attendance was erratic. In June 2018 the last family therapy session was due to take place. He had gone missing from home.

On 12 June 2018 he presented at Manchester Royal Infirmary seeking help having slept rough in Manchester and reporting thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to CAMHS for follow up. On 14 June 2018 he told Beech Hall he was likely to harm himself if he went home. They took him to Macclesfield A&E where a detailed assessment and gathering of information resulted in him being admitted on a voluntary basis to the Hope unit.

He arrived there at 1am on 15 June. He did not like it. He was assessed and was allowed to leave the unit on 15 June. Following further psychiatric assessment from the unit whilst in the community he was placed on quetiapine. Concordance was initially good but deteriorated. The planned discharge from the Hope Unit services took place on 2 July 2018. On 2 July 2018 he went missing from home and was found at Crewe Railway Station. The CAMHS plan was to discharge him and move him to the transition team which was discussed on 20 August 2018. He was to have a new therapist.

On 24 August 2018 he went missing from home. He was found and taken to Stepping Hill Hospital and assessed by RAID. He had bought paracetamol with the intention of taking his life. He expressed concern about his discharge from CAMHS. He was discharged to see CAMHS on 31 August 2018. He was due to return to Beech Hall on 5 September 2018.

On 5 September he was reported as missing from home. He was found by a member of the public in the early hours of the morning having taken an overdose of heroin. Medical intervention reversed the outcome of the overdose. He was assessed by the RAID team. There was a failure to consider the full circumstances of his history and a failure by mental health providers involved in his care to effectively communicate. As a result the level of risk he presented was not adequately understood. He was discharged to the Home Treatment Team. The Home Treatment Team saw him on 13 September 2018. Professionals in his care recognised the increasing risk in relation to his behaviour. The Home Treatment Team failed to appreciate the level of risk he presented.

On the evening of 14 September 2018 he presented at A&E at Stepping Hill Hospital with suicidal ideation. He was seen and assessed by RAID. There was a failure to fully assess him or understand the complexities and level of risk he presented. He was discharged home into the community to see the Home Treatment Team on 15 September 2018. He saw the Home Treatment Team on 15, 18 and 30 September 2018. On 30 September he was discharged from the Home Treatment Team.

On 8 October at school he appeared to accept the reduced academic aspirations for him. A further reduced academic timetable was sent to him on 12 October 2018.

On 17 October 2018 he went missing from home. This was reported to Greater Manchester Police. On the morning of 18 October 2018 he was found by a dog walker in Gatley Hill. A typed note was found on him. He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital and his death was confirmed. Toxicology confirmed that he had taken a fatal dose of heroin.","The inquest was told that the provision of mental health services post 16 varies widely across the country. In some areas there is a CAMHS 16-25 mental health service provision similar to the national 16 and under service whereas in other areas there is a limited transition service or move back to primary care for re-referral to adult services. The inquest was told that this creates a cliff edge high risk situation for adolescents. The reason for the difference was resources and decisions taken by CCGs.

The inquest was told that it is important for autism to be diagnosed as early as possible so that appropriate support can be put in place. Early diagnosis was impacted by a national picture of long waiting lists for ADOS assessments. In Stockport there was approximately a 6 month waiting list for assessment. This was against a national picture of 12-24 month waits in some areas.

During the inquest evidence was heard that acceleration ahead of a chronological school age might cause relatively few difficulties in peer relationships up to about year 9 but post that as children entered adolescence it could become a significant issue impacting a child’s mental health and ability to cope. Where it did happen, there needed to be an understanding by schools of the risks and early signs indicating a need for additional support to try to reduce the likelihood of self-harming behaviours and the potential need for additional support.

The inquest heard that Oliver had found the autism label and the label of disability that was attached to it very difficult to accept as time went on. There was evidence that particularly with high achieving children with autism the idea that they had a disability created additional challenge.

The language that it would have been more helpful to use widely would have been difference rather than disability.","""Narrative: Suicide contributed to by a failure by mental health services""; ""he transitioned from child and adolescent mental health services into the reduced provision and support available post 16""; ""he returned to year 11 at Manchester Grammar School""; ""transferred to Beech Hall School in September 2017, dropping back to a year below his chronological age to repeat year 10""; ""discussions about post 16 provision as he approached his 16th birthday""; ""CAMHS within Stockport is a service for children up to 16""; ""On 18 October 2018 he was found by a dog walker in Gatley Hill.

Before his birth Torbay Children's Social Care had identified potential for his significant harm following his birth.

He was known to the Police by September 2002 when he was found playing alone in a park. Reports were made to Torbay Children's Social Care indicating that he had been neglected.

At age five, consideration was given to long term care by Torbay Children's Services. In June 2007 approval was given for a kinship care in Essex. This was brought to an end at short notice and he was returned to Torbay. He spent several years in various foster care and respite care placements. The precise number of placements could not be identified.

In January 2010 he was made known to the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service following his jumping a river and expressing a wish to die. On 18 September 2017 the deceased's then foster carer became concerned for his welfare, having found a note. The Police were notified. The deceased was located on a viaduct by the Police and taken to a place of safety for assessment. He was referred to the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service Crisis Team. The Crisis Team subsequently closed his support/case. On 14 December 2017 he was accepted into the Torbay Autism Assessment Service.

On 1 January 2018 the deceased told his then foster carer that he was going to visit a friend and would return at 7pm. The deceased visited his friend. The account of the investigating Police Officer is that he discussed ending his own life with the friend.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28/06/2019. The medical cause of death was:

1a Hanging from ligature around the neck","Sam died on 9 November 2018 at home [REDACTED] Milton Keynes having been found hanging by the neck by his sister on her return from school. Sam had been engaged with COMPASS services through a school referral. He had been referred to CAMHS in May 2018 but did not meet the threshold for engagement. His GP suggested other organisations who Sam could approach voluntarily for support, but he did not take up these suggestions.","1) Sam’s GP referred Sam to CAMHS when he presented to the GP with irritability, anger and a report that he was close to being excluded from school. CAMHS rejected the referral because Sam did not meet their threshold of moderate to severe mental health issues. CAMHS did not suggest any alternative assistance. The GP did follow up with Sam to signpost him to two independent organisations who Sam would have to approach independently for help. The GP made it clear in his evidence that there is a lack of lower level assistance for young people who present with ‘life issues’ such as low mood, irritability and anger issues, but who nonetheless need help and assistance but do not meet the criteria for access to CAMHS services.

2) Sam had been referred to, and was receiving the services of COMPASS having been referred by his school. The GP was not made aware of this engagement and was unable to take this into account at the time when Sam did present himself to the GP. The evidence from COMPASS is that they maintain the confidentiality of patients, even minors using their services, unless they have express consent to disclose that information from the patient themselves. Without all relevant information neither the GP nor CAMHS was in a position to make a fully informed decision about Sam’s needs. Sharing of information between relevant health agencies to ensure fully informed decisions are made as regards the healthcare needs of an individual should be a priority.

3) Evidence at the inquest from the GP also indicated that a reduction in healthcare provision at Sam’s school and in particular the removal of a medically qualified person(s) has meant that confidential health information is no longer shared between the school and the GP surgery. The school now only engages first aiders, who are not medically qualified, and who do not therefore exchange information which in the past has proved essential in flagging concerns between the GP and the school. This is another route which has been closed and which would have allowed a potential flag to have been raised in respect of concerns around Sam and his wellbeing to be shared confidentially between GP and school.","""Sam Michael Carl Grant aged 16""; ""medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging from ligature around the neck""; ""Sam died on 9 November 2018 at home ... having been found hanging by the neck by his sister""",True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

Burke,Yorkshire West Western,The Secretary of State for Education The Right Honourable Mr Gavin Williamson; The Chief Executive of UCAS; The Chief Executive of The Sixth Form Colleges Association,"On 20 August 2018 an investigation was commenced into the death of Owen Arron Wynne Williams.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 2 May 2019

The inquest determined that the medical cause of Owen's death was due to hanging and a conclusion of suicide was made.","Owen Williams attended Greenhead Sixth Form College in Huddersfield West Yorkshire to undertake various A levels, sitting all relevant exams in May / June 2018.

He was described as a high performing student by the principal of the college who gave evidence at the inquest.

He was described by teaching staff and his tutor as a reliable, cheerful and fully engaged young man.

Owen was expected to achieve the grades required to be accepted on the university course he had set his mind upon attending.

None of his teachers or tutor had any cause for concern for his health and wellbeing.

Owen stayed with his sister and her family in Elland the night before his A level results were released.

There was nothing in Owens presentation which gave his sister and her family cause for concern.

At 6.00am on 16 August 2018 Greenhead College released A level results electronically which was accessible to all students. The college was open from 8.00am to provide student support and result sheets were available from the college from 9.00am.

At 6.30am on 16 August 2018 Owens brother in law got up for work and noted Owen was not in the house, his laptop was open, all of Owens personal possessions including his phone and wallet were still present.

Over the ensuing hours his sister and brother in law immediately undertook checks and searches to try and locate Owen, all to no gain.

They therefore contacted West Yorkshire Police, who immediately commenced a missing persons investigation.

Later that day Owen was found unresponsive suspended by a rope tied to a tree in a secluded wooded area near to his sisters home.

Owens death was confirmed by attendant paramedics a short time later.

Subsequent enquiries revealed that Owen had accessed his results and had not achieved his expected grades required for the university course he wished to attend.

Owen’s father expressed deep concerns at the way in which Owen had access to his results and stated that if Owen had been required to personally attend the college, an approach adopted by other educational institutions, and expressed the view that Owen would have been able to immediately access support and guidance and that the tragic events which occurred would have been avoided.","I heard evidence from the Principal of the college that Owen attended that there is wide variance both locally and nationally of the timing and way in which colleges release A level results, some release results electronically as early as 6.00 am and later the same morning provide a facility within the school and college to provide support to students, some colleges / schools require the students to physically attend to obtain their results, when at the same time support by staff members is immediately on hand.

I understand UCAS is available from 8.00 am onwards, once again some hours after some students have obtained their results.

In particular, from the evidence presented to me it appears:-

1. That there is no national agreement across all educational institutions to the timing and manner in which A level results are released.

2. That there can be a significant time lag between results being released by some schools and colleges and the timing of when there is the availability of staff to provide support to those students that may have received unexpected results.

3. That UCAS is presently available some hours after some educational institutions have released student results.

4. That there is no national requirement for educational establishments to communicate directly to parents in advance of results day and explain the system in place for the release of the A level results at the educational establishment that their child is attending and to alert them to the potential that unexpected results can occur and to be alert to the impact that this may have upon their child.","""the medical cause of Owen's death was due to hanging and a conclusion of suicide was made""; ""Owen Williams attended Greenhead Sixth Form College in Huddersfield West Yorkshire to undertake various A levels, sitting all relevant exams in May / June 2018""",True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was that Geoff Gray’s death was by suicide.,"At approximately 01.10 hours on 17 September 2001 in the grounds of the Officers’ Mess of the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, Surrey, Private Geoff Gray was found shot.

2.

3. It is of concern that where assumptions of suicide lead to cursory post-mortem investigations this creates a risk that homicides will go undetected. The higher the possibility that homicides will be distinguished from self-inflicted deaths, the greater the deterrence to those who might have reason to try to make a murder look like a suicide.

4. The use of a forensic post-mortem, or at very least something more than a basic ‘routine’ examination in all cases of sudden death by gunshot may, by enhancing the quality of investigations and ensuring that assumptions of suicide are properly tested, reduce that risk.","""the conclusion of the inquest was that Geoff Gray’s death was by suicide""; ""Geoff was 17½ years old""",True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

I concluded an inquest on 24 May 2015.","Noah was 15 years of age. At the beginning of July 2018 Noah’s mother was made aware of online communication between Noah and a friend in which he expressed an intention to take his own life by jumping off a bridge. Noah’s mother acted immediately upon this concern and both made an appointment for Noah to see his GP and to attend Door43 an organisation that provides emotional support for young people.

Noah’s and his mother attended the GP appointment with the specific intention to obtain help by way of a referral to CAMHS. Noah’s GP was told that he had suicidal thoughts and had plans to take his own life. Noah’s GP completed a written, non-urgent, referral to CAMHS

CAMHS processed the referral promptly but the referral contained insufficient information for a risk assessment to be performed. Therefore, CAMHS closed Noah’s referral but invited his GP to provide further information. Noah’s GP planned to use the appointment arranged on 6 August 2018 as an opportunity to obtain the further information sought by CAMHS.

Noah’s family were not notified that CAMHS had declined the referral. The Trust accepted that the process of requesting further information was not sufficiently robust and that telephone contact with the GP should have been made. This would have avoided the need for a re-referral. Had the information been known that Noah was actively making plans to take his own life CAMHS would have categorised his appointment as urgent and seen him within 2 weeks.

Assumptions were made regarding the support being offered to Noah by Door43. The Trust accepted that the actual level of support ought to have been confirmed directly between CAMHS and Door43.

The Trust accepted that the current referral form does not capture the information required to process referrals without delay.

Noah went on holiday with his father and step-mother between 22 July and 29 July 2018. Noah was not seen by CAMHS on his return.

On 1 August 2018 Noah was not open with his mother about his plans. Instead of spending the day with friends he travelled, by a pre-planned route, to Conisbrough Viaduct. Sometime after 1.30pm Noah took his own life by jumping from the Viaduct.","1. As I made clear during the inquest I was concerned about the adequacy of the CAMHS, GP referral form. [REDACTED], Noah’s GP, was inexperienced she had not completed a CAMHS referral form before. She accepted that she had not provided sufficient detail in the form. This resulted in CAMHS being unable to assess Noah’s risk and declining Noah’s referral. This in turn meant that Noah did not receive an appointment with CAMHS before his death.

The Trust’s investigation report stated that the evidence “suggests that the current referral form does not capture the information required to process referrals without delay.”

[REDACTED], CAMHS Clinical Lead, said that there had not been any other problems with the form with GPs not completing them sufficiently. I am not sure how [REDACTED] is able to be so confident about this.

I was told that redesigning the form had been considered by the Trust but was told that this was not the answer. Instead, further training has been provided to GPs within the area. Guidance is attached to the form to assist GPs in completing the form.

Having carefully considered the evidence I am not satisfied that steps have been put in place to ameliorate the risk identified. Given the realities of the pressures on a GP’s day expecting a GP to use their 10 minute appointment to extract sufficient information for the referral and then at some point complete a referral form, with which they may be unfamiliar, creates the risk that relevant information may not be provided. I would invite the Trust to reconsider whether the form could be improved to reduce the risk of inadequate or insufficient information being provided which may result in a delay in care.","""Noah was 15 years of age""; ""he expressed an intention to take his own life by jumping off a bridge""; ""Noah’s GP was told that he had suicidal thoughts and had plans to take his own life""; ""Sometime after 1.30pm Noah took his own life by jumping from the Viaduct""",True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

Narrative conclusion

Aryan Akhgar died on 6 March 2018 in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield following an incident on 16 February 2018 when he hanged himself from a self-administered ligature with the intent to take his own life.

Aryan’s death occurred against a background of four serious attempts to take his own life on 3 January 2018, 6 January 2018, 9 January 2018 and 11 January 2018. Aryan was assessed on 9 January 2018 by specialists from the Adult Mental Health Trust in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield and discharged home to his family. That assessment recommended an urgent response and visit the next day by the Home Treatment Team. The Home Treatment Team declined the referral because Aryan was under 18. The STAR team in CAMHS did not at that time provide an urgent response service. The first visit by mental health professionals to Aryan therefore was not until 15 January 2018 because of this gap in provision.

Aryan was seen by the STAR Deliberate Self Harm team on 15 January 2018, 21 January 2018 and 3 February 2018 and was then discharged. Aryan then hanged himself on 16 February 2018.","Aryan’s medical cause of death was due to hanging. All witnesses accepted that there was a gap in services for Aryan and, notwithstanding the evidence of the Medical Director of the Sheffield Children’s Hospital, I remained concerned that difficulties in securing funding might jeopardise his proposed solution.","A gap in services was identified for 16 and 17 years olds with urgent mental health issues, such as Aryan had. On 9 January 2018, Aryan was assessed as requiring urgent mental health input, commencing the next day. This was not available as a service for under 18s in Sheffield and Aryan did not receive any contact from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) until 15 January 2018. In evidence I was told that additional resources in the CAMHS service were close to agreement in order to prevent this kind of problem arising in the future. However, this would be subject to a commissioning process from the Clinical Commissioning Group for Sheffield which could not be guaranteed.

It was accepted in evidence by the Medical Director of the Sheffield Children’s Hospital on behalf of CAMHS that such additional resource was required. The delivery of the necessary funding to properly resource the CAMHS team was not guaranteed.","""Aryan Akhgar aged 17""; ""he hanged himself from a self-administered ligature with the intent to take his own life""; ""Aryan then hanged himself on 16 February 2018""; ""Aryan’s medical cause of death was due to hanging""",True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

The evidence does not reveal whether she intended to die.","Ellie Long was receiving treatment in the community from the Eating Disorder Service. She was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa and Depression. On the morning of 10 December 2017, Miss Long went to her bedroom, where she was found hanging later that morning. Emergency Services were called, and Miss Long was taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where she died on 12 December 2017.","1. Record keeping and auditing of record keeping

a) Not all records were properly recorded on Lorenzo. Further, personal handwritten notes were made of some meetings which were not then reflected in the electronic records. Some of these notes only came to light during the inquest hearing. It is, of course, imperative that all staff recognise their obligations in respect of keeping full and contemporaneous electronic records and that full disclosure of all relevant documents is made in a timely fashion before the inquest commences. This avoids potential delay in the inquest process and further distress to the family.

b) Some action has been taken by NSFT in this respect, not least in that the team is now better resourced staff-wise. Further action has been and is being taken to ensure staff appreciate the importance of full record keeping. An audit of the records has been undertaken to ensure full compliance with record keeping requirements but this will only continue until 100% compliance has been achieved.

c) Concern remains in that staff do change over time and matters raised now do not necessarily remain at the forefront of an individual’s mind, especially when under time pressure. Good record keeping is an integral part of any good service and must be second nature to all staff. It must be fully appreciated by all as “a vital component in the management of risk”. Further, record keeping has been raised elsewhere as a matter of concern within NSFT.

d) I have concern that full record keeping and disclosure requirements will not remain a priority.

2. Communication with external agencies

a) An initial full, updating letter was sent to Ellie’s GP. However no further updating information was sent. A letter was written providing updating information, but this was not sent. No further updating information was sent to the GP by telephone, letter or email.

b) The evidence heard is that efforts were made to contact the school by telephone. However, the school had no record of any such calls. There is no evidence of email or written correspondence or further telephone calls in an effort to communicate with the school.

c) It is accepted by the Trust that sharing of relevant information is necessary. NSFT has indicated it will “remind staff of the importance of recording efforts to share information/maintain communication”.

d) Sharing of information and communication with external agencies is a matter which has been raised with NSFT on previous occasions. The importance of “recording efforts to share information …” may not be sufficient to prevent future deaths. It is the importance of sharing information and communicating with external agencies that should be addressed here.

She was in contact with mental health services up until the evening of 30 April 2018 before she killed herself the next morning.","1. Delay in IAPT counselling

a) After [REDACTED] turned 18 she moved to adult mental health services. She had parallel contact with her GP surgery [REDACTED]. Shortly before [REDACTED] 18th birthday, according to the MPFT clinical review (page 9 of 33), [REDACTED] was referred to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) by the [REDACTED] Access Team for assessment for psychological therapy or counselling. On 14 November 2017 (page 12 of 33) it was agreed with [REDACTED] to add her to her GP surgery waiting list for counselling in line with her treatment preference. [REDACTED] remained on the IAPT waiting list for counselling at the time of her death.

b) The evidence at the inquest was that a 3 month time interval would be optimal but in [REDACTED] case, in relation to this GP surgery, 10 months would be the norm. Such a delay is sub-optimal and could have an adverse effect on a patient waiting for counselling to commence.

2. Risk assessment and progress notes.

a) The electronic records were hard for a lay person to follow or understand particularly when said to have been updated or validated with the potential for original entries to have been overwritten (as opposed to amended or deleted).

b) This is distinct from progress notes and/or risk assessments being accurately recorded. It was not clear when and how often risk assessments should be updated and how and when they would be read in conjunction with the progress notes.

Kearsley,Greater Manchester North,Secretary of State for Education - Department of Education,"On 19 November 2018 I concluded an inquest into the death of Ben Walmsley, date of birth 21.09.2002, who died on 04.02.2018 aged 15 years old.",The circumstances of the death are that on 4 February 2018 Ben Walmsley committed suicide at his home address by hanging.,"During the course of the investigation into Ben's death it emerged that on a number of days in the month prior to his death he had searched on the school (St Phillips Secondary School) computers ""how to kill myself"", ""how to tie a noose"" and ""why I shouldn't commit suicide"".

It was explained to the court that the school filters are accessed via Smoothwall which provides age-appropriate filtered content. Whilst Ben could not access these pages as they were blocked, there was no mechanism in place at the time for the school to be made aware that a pupil may have attempted to search for such pages.

The court heard evidence that at the time of Ben's death the only monitoring was in lessons and was solely reliant on the teacher trying to watch what students were doing. The school has 900 pupils and the court heard in any one day there can be 12,000 attempts by pupils to access blocked content. Not all of these would be as concerning as the content Ben was trying to access, some may relate to social media pages which the school does not allow.

Evidence was provided to the court that since Ben's death, Smoothwall have now upgraded functionality and staff now receive notifications when blocked high-risk safeguarding categories are attempting to be accessed.

These alerts are ""real time"" notifications and go to three identified members of staff. Since this installation staff have been notified of two other children attempting to access similar sites to Ben and have taken action to speak to them and also to speak to their parents to offer support.

However it is not known if this functionality is mandatory for all schools or indeed whether other software providers who are used by schools have this option.

If schools do not have this facility you may wish to consider disseminating this information, this is of course a matter for yourself.","""date of birth 21.09.2002, who died on 04.02.2018 aged 15 years old""; ""Ben Walmsley committed suicide at his home address by hanging""",True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Wilcox,London Inner West,"Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director, NHS England; Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP, Secretary of State for Health, Department of Health; Paul Rees, CEO, Royal College of Psychiatrists; [REDACTED], CNWL CCG Chair, Central & North West London NHS Foundation Trust","On the 3rd October 2018, evidence was heard touching the death of Maximilien Conrad Kohler. Max had been found deceased hanging by a belt around his neck from a pull-up bar positioned across his bedroom door at his home address. He was 15 years old at the time of his death. The findings of the court were as follows:

How, when and where the deceased came by his death:

Max suffered with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Syndrome. At times symptoms of ASD would overwhelm him and he would attempt to take his own life or self-harm. On 5/5/2018 he was found hanging by his father at his home address. Despite resuscitation his life could not be saved and he was recognised as life extinct at 07:23. He had left 2 messages expressing intent and demonstrating capacity.","Evidence taken at the inquest confirmed that Max had not been diagnosed with ASD until he saw a third and very experienced Child and Adult Psychiatrist, at least in part because Max was clever and able to cross compensate for the issues that the ASD caused him and instead had been incorrectly diagnosed with depression and bulimia nervosa, of which there was no evidence when he was assessed at length in an inpatient setting. These diagnoses had at least in part been arrived at by the use of questionnaires. Expert evidence was taken and accepted by the court that the earlier misdiagnosis may have been contributed to by the latest fashion in mental health to over rely on questionnaires and perhaps less upon clinical evaluation of the whole picture presented by the patient. It is possible that such over-reliance can contribute to misdiagnoses and underestimate risk.

The over reliance on the use of questionnaires to assess the risk of self-harm, compared to full psychiatric history taking and evaluation of the patient in the round by a clinician with experience has been a repeated theme in inquests.

It was also discussed and accepted by the court that the current training regime for the training of specialist doctors is shorter than it was in the past so that doctors now become consultants with far less experience at senior registrar level, and consequently less exposure to and skill with diagnostics across the range of psychiatric conditions.

Further it was discussed and accepted by the court that there is a relative paucity of services for conditions which are chronic and difficult to treat and cure compared to illnesses which respond to short term therapies, and so show easily auditable improvements in health with the application of evidence based guidance.

This was considered by the expert and accepted by the court to reflect the style of commissioning of care by CCGs who wish to support and prioritise the services to relatively easily treatable conditions.

ASD was accepted to be a lifelong incurable condition which responds only to long term supportive care, and so to have expensive and resource rich treatment requirements. As such ASD would come towards the bottom of the pile for CCG commissioned treatment and care.

The expert stated that care provision is even worse for adults with ASD and other similar conditions than for children.

Max’s parents gave extensive evidence in relation to the support and information that they have received since his suicide compared to the time when they were trying to care for him whilst he was alive. They described a lacuna in support and educational provision for parents attempting to assist a child with ASD.

When Max needed urgent in patient admission there was no bed available in London in Child and Adolescent psychiatric services, and if his parents had not been able to access private health care he would have needed to have been hospitalised in Sheffield.

A report from CNWL, accepted by the court, stated that a new facility is currently being built to provide psychiatric beds for children and adolescents in West London, but this cannot alone address the scarcity of provision across the rest of London and England.","1. That delays in diagnosis and misdiagnosis in medicine due to reduced time in training for doctors in general and psychiatry in particular may imperil the lives of vulnerable patients.

2. That over-reliance in the current fashion on questionnaires used in diagnostics and management may impede rather than assist doctors and other clinicians, firstly to arrive at the correct diagnosis in the first place, and secondly to cause or contribute to underestimation or proper evaluation of the risk of self-harm in particular.

3. That the NHS care commissioning structure is biased against the commissioning of services for chronic incurable conditions in general and ASD in particular.

4. That there is a lack of support and education available for parents caring for children with ASD.

5. That there is a severe shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for children and adolescents in the NHS.

6.

Roberts,Cumbria,Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust); North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group; Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,"On 12 April 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karen Jane Edgar. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 April 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was Karen was suffering from emotional and behavioural issues and was referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in October 2015, aged 15. Her first substantive meeting with her mental health practitioner was on 8 February 2016, when family work was planned. She did not start individual talking therapy until 7 April. Family therapy had ceased to be available. After only one more 1:1 session on 25 April she was, on 5 May, seen by a psychiatrist who prescribed fluoxetine 10mg. In July it was increased to 20mg. On 29 September she took an overdose of paracetamol, then raised the alarm and received inpatient general hospital attention. Her true intention was not clear. The psychiatrist changed her medication to sertraline 50mg which commenced on about 7 March 2017, after only twelve 1:1 sessions. On 22 March she was involved in an outburst at school relating to her boyfriend, from whom she had split in February. At the 1:1 on 29 March she was angry and upset and later that day researched 'suicide note' on the internet. Sertraline was increased to 100mg on 30 March. She had convinced herself she was pregnant and told her former boyfriend on 1 April. She admitted to a friend having tried to hang herself. On the evening of 7 April she had an angry exchange with her former boyfriend over the pregnancy issue via text and went home. Whilst her parents were not in the house she hanged herself from a dressing gown cord in a wardrobe in her bedroom. She was discovered soon afterwards, but despite medical treatment did not recover and was pronounced dead at West Cumberland Hospital at 01:10 hours on 8 April. She had made a cut in the ligature with a pair of scissors.

Medical cause: Hanging.

Conclusion: Misadventure; she hanged herself as a gesture intending to be discovered.","Karen had been displaying behavioural and anger problems for many months when there was a major incident in August 2015 which resulted in her and her parents seeking help. Despite a referral to CAMHS in October 2015 assessment appointments did not take place until early December and January. Family work was proposed but only two meetings took place before it ceased to be available. Karen did not start 1:1 work until April 2016, nearly six months from first seeing her GP. She only had 13 talking sessions from the first assessment in December 2015 until her death in April 2017. The psychiatrist diagnosed her with moderately severe depressive disorder and prescribed antidepressants after only two 1:1 sessions. (NICE suggests 4-6 sessions). She was not monitored closely on four drug changes. It remains an open question as to whether the introduction of sertraline a month before is implicated in her death. Whilst the mental health worker did her level best it seems that the resources were inadequate to support Karen and she received sub-optimal care. The Trust's own report revealed a long list of failings including:- no care plan; lack of 'packages of care'; gaps in work force and skills base; absence of family therapy; failure to re-assess risk formally; lack of Multi-disciplinary Meetings; absence of holistic approach and not engaging more productively with her school. Many of these issues were themes found to be endemic in the Trust by the CQC in its report of 26 January 2018.","(1) The provision of mental health services for children and young people in Cumbria is underfunded.
(2) There are long delays in getting treatment.
(3) Failure to provide for these young people means they risk entering adulthood with unresolved mental health issues.
(4) Lives are lost and damaged; including the effect on families as a whole.
(5) The financial cost to the state of such deaths is huge; 4 paramedics attended as did an out of hours doctor; at least 11 police staff; hospital staff; A&E consultant; Local Safeguarding processes; costs of inquests and Trust’s legal representation etc. all of which would be better spent on prevention.

Voisin,Avon,Avon & Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust; Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust; NHS England,"On 28 July 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rebecca Jay ROMERO, aged 15 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 December 2017.

The medical cause of death was given as:

Ia Hanging

The conclusion was:

Accidental death contributed to by neglect","Rebecca Romero died on 19 July 2017 at her home address. She had been found in the bathroom with a ligature around her neck and she died from the injuries sustained. Rebecca had been discharged from a psychiatric unit on 14 July 2017 and was under the care of the community team at the time of her death. She had not been seen since her discharge.

Rebecca had a long history of self-harm and mental health problems; she was described as appearing very vulnerable with very few factors of resilience. In June 2016 she began using ligaturing as a means of self-harm. It was agreed by a number of witnesses that that elevated Becky's risk.

On 10 June 2017 she was admitted to Pebble Lodge Adolescent Unit in Dorset as there were no beds for her in the local area of Bristol at the unit called Riverside.

On 6 July she was released for a period of leave; what in fact transpired was she never returned to Pebble Lodge after this period of leave.

On 14 July there was a discharge meeting and a community care package was put into place.

I was told that the original plan was to arrange to transfer Becky to Riverside but as there was no place available attempts were made to discharge her to Riverside as a day placement patient. Unfortunately there were no day placements available either and therefore a community care package was put into place. One witness described the community care package as ""it just didn't feel very comfortable.""

Furthermore the evidence at the inquest from NHS England was at the time of Becky's discharge that a day patient placement was available at Riverside.

An independent witness also gave evidence at the inquest and said he was concerned about the length of time that Becky was without a medical review and that post discharge was at a very high risk time. He stated that the amount of contact from 6 July to the time of her death was not acceptable and that the plan to see Becky once a week following her discharge was not sufficient.

A number of other points were raised at the inquest as follows:
• In relation to the transfer from Pebble Lodge to Riverside it appears that a Form 1 was submitted to Riverside on 15 June but that the referral was closed on 6 July. There appeared to be confusion by some as to whether this was being followed up.
• The community care plan that was in place from 14 July had no dates for tasks to be completed or for meetings to take place, by way of example at the time of her death a medical review appointment was still not in the diary.
• Different people described Becky's risks in different ways, terminology such as low, medium or high were used to describe her risk but others used significant or low and even on the date of discharge her risks were described in different ways.
• Part of the care plan was for there to be communication by text with Becky up until the time of her death there was only one text sent which was effectively confirming an appointment for after her death and simply stating ""how are you"". I was told that there is no current training or guidance given to staff.
• This case highlighted some of the difficulties in transferring children to an in-patient unit out of the area and then arranging to transfer them back to the area.","(1) In this case there was confusion as to whether on an in-patient transfer there should be a Form 2 to go alongside the Form 1 procedure. As well as clarifying this process with all providers concerned consideration should be given that a clear documented process is put in place for in-patient transfers so that all those involved understand clearly the situation and the decision made in relation to the patient.

(2) Consideration should be given to ensuring that all care plans are time specific so that dates of meetings or dates for tasks to be completed are set at the time of the meeting so again expectations are managed and everyone knows exactly what the plan is and when actions will occur.

(3) That the issue of inconsistent terminology when assessing risk is reviewed to ensure a consistent approach. In this case there were a number of different phrases and gradings used to determine the deceased's risk.

(4) That consideration should be given to training and/or guidance issued for staff communicating with young persons by text or any means of social media.

(5) Consideration should be given to reviewing whether there ought to be guidance issued when managing children who go out of area for psychiatric in-patient care and further guidance issued in the management of children when returning to their local area when they have been an in-patient out of area. Whether certain steps should be taken to ensure best practice and a consistent approach e.g. risk assessing; face to face meetings; robust care planning; parental involvement; how best to re-integrate back into the local area/team.","""Rebecca Jay ROMERO, aged 15 years""; ""medical cause of death was given as: Ia Hanging""; ""Rebecca had a long history of self-harm and mental health problems""; ""she was described as appearing very vulnerable""; ""In June 2016 she began using ligaturing as a means of self-harm""; ""Rebecca Romero died on 19 July 2017 at her home address.

Ellery,"Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin",Mr Neil Carr OBE; The Chief Executive of South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Trust,"On 31 January 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jeff David Antwis, 14 years of age. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 November 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.",On 30 January 2017 at approximately 05:30 hours a train travelling south along the railway line at Harlescott level crossing Shrewsbury struck the deceased causing serious head injuries. He was transferred by ambulance to the Royal Stoke University Hospital where at 17:18 hours he was confirmed dead. The deceased was a vulnerable teenager with a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome with a history of self-harm escalating to suicide attempts. In answers to a miracle question he indicated that he wished to die. An urgent medical review was appropriate but not carried out however it cannot be said to have caused or contributed to the death.,"(1) Following an urgent referral by Jeff’s GP to (the then) Shropshire CAMHS on 10 January 2017 a timely response was made with an initial appointment with a mental health practitioner taking place on the 12th. A further appointment was arranged for 25 January (an earlier date clashed with an existing medical appointment) and in the meantime Jeff was given a miracle question to complete.

(2) Jeff answered the miracle question indicating that he wished to die. He passed it to his mother who immediately contacted the mental health practitioner who in turn referred it and the initial assessment to a consultant physiatrist for review. The consultant physiatrist did not consider the matter urgent and arranged for a routine medical review for 17 March 2017.

(3) At the second meeting on 25 January 2017 Jeff and his mother were informed of the appointment for 17 March 2017. Jeff’s mother immediately raised concerns and asked for it to be brought forward. She was told she would have to write in and make a complaint. This was a time sensitive situation adding to the problem without resolving it.

(4) On 30 January 2017 Jeff killed himself on the railway line.

(5) Independent expert evidence from a child and adolescent consultant physiatrist indicated that Jeff should have been offered an urgent medical review appointment for 27 January 2017 (i.e. within 7 days of the internal referral to the consultant physiatrist) and not, as a routine appointment, 17 March 2017. It cannot be said that such earlier appointment would have addressed Jeff’s problems and altered his wish to die but it is possible that earlier intervention may have lifted his spirits and not, according to his mother, ‘wilted’. It undoubtedly would have helped and at least been an earlier step in seeking to help Jeff.

(6) Other matters of concern arose from the evidence. The mental health practitioner:

a) Was aware of the deliberate self-harm protocol but not its content.

b) Carried out a risk assessment on a subjective basis without reference to any known definition e.g. serious or significant.

c) Had no mechanism for referring back to the consultant physiatrist appointment, whether she agreed with the request or not.

(7) As stated Jeff had a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome with autistic spectrum disorder. Concerns were raised to what extent these conditions may have masked Jeff’s suicidal ideation on presentation and to what extent, if it is the case, they were recognised.

(8) From evidence given at the inquest it is clear that the provision of child and adolescent mental health service is in transition, having moved from Shropshire CAMHS to part of South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Trust. Certain actions are already being taken and these concerns are raised so that a holistic approach can be taken and fed into what is already an ongoing wider review.","""14 years of age""; ""The conclusion of the inquest was suicide""; ""Jeff killed himself on the railway line""; ""Following an urgent referral by Jeff’s GP to (the then) Shropshire CAMHS""; ""vulnerable teenager""",True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,True

Williams,Somerset,"Head of Services CAMHS West; The Managing Director, NHS Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group; Director of Children’s Services, Somerset County Council","On 22/09/2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sofia Ann Legg. Sofia was aged 14 years when she died on 26 September 2016. The medical cause of death was hanging. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, that on 20 September 2016 at 25 Saxon Way, Cheddar, Sofia deliberately suspended herself by the neck with the intention of ending her life.","Sofia had previously suffered from low mood. In Year 8 both school and family noticed significant changes in Sofia’s behaviour, including self-harming. Sofia’s mother was sufficiently concerned to attend the family G.P., who wrote to CAMHS West supporting a referral from Sofia’s school. By letter dated 2 April 2015 CAMHS West stated that Sofia’s difficulties did not meet criteria for specialist CAMHS intervention.

In February 2016 Sofia attended her G.P. with her mother, Sofia’s hair was starting to break, her self-confidence fell as her hair became thinner. Sofia and her mother returned to the G.P. a number of times and in June 2016 the G.P. agreed if Sofia was stressed, it was documented that Sofia has been low for months, was self-harming again but denied any suicidal thoughts. Following an attendance at the G.P. on 12 July 2016 it was noted that Sofia has expressed some suicidal thoughts. An expert referral was made to CAMHS West. Sofia was seen by a care-co-ordinator at CAMHS West on 15 July 2016 and again on 29 July 2016. Sofia was given the opportunity to speak to the care coordinator alone. Sofia was placed on a 6 month waiting list for CBT. Sofia’s mother appeared to her mother to have a good summer holiday but upon returning to school in September 2016 Sofia started to isolate herself. Sofia’s mother arranged an appointment with Sofia’s care coordinator at CAMHS on 19 September 2016. Again Sofia had the chance to speak to the care co-ordinator alone and again Sofia admitted to suicidal thoughts. From the evidence of the care co-ordinator and Sofia’s mother it was identified that there was a difference in recollection of what was discussed and expressed at that meeting. Matters that the care coordinator identified as discussed were not subsequently identified in Sofia’s care plan, the care co-ordinator has no urgent contact with Sofia’s school and no urgent contact with a psychiatrist. No follow up appointment was made. On the following day 26 September 2016 Sofia’s mother following discussions with Sofia attended work and upon return home discovered Sofia hanging. Sofia left an apologetic ‘suicide note’.","1. Access to CAMHS. Sofia was rejected for referral in April 2015. Might a lower threshold and earlier proactive interventionist policy have been of positive benefit to Sofia.

2. Availability of CBT. Sofia was placed on a 6 month waiting list for CBT. This delay appears considerable.

3. Sofia’s care co-ordinator at CAMHS did not obtain the urgent input of a psychiatrist in accordance with NICE guidance.

4. The recollections of Sofia’s care co-ordinator and Sofia’s mother as to the meeting of 19 September were at odds with each other. Sofia’s care co-ordinator recollected in her evidence telling Sofia’s mother that Sofia was not to be left alone. Sofia’s mother deemed the impression from Sofia’s care co-ordinator’s evidence was of Sofia being in an extremely vulnerable and dangerous position but this was not reflected in Sofia’s care plan which made no mention of her not being left alone and it was not reflected in the care co-ordinator’s actions in not urgently contacting Sofia’s school, where she would be during the following days, or a psychiatrist. Her care plan appears to be the critical written record of the outcomes of this meeting as it was not of sufficient detail to safeguard Sofia.

5. Language used in the SIRI Report was felt to be inappropriate. The SIRI Report effectively said if the care plan had been followed the outcome might have been different and that no change in clinical practice would have resulted in any different outcome.

He was taken to the GP by his mum and he was entered into the care of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. He was diagnosed with low mood and anxiety and was treated with fluoxetine. His mental health continued to deteriorate and he refused to engage with any professionals tasked with trying to assist him. His mother went to his mental health appointments alone without her son and the majority of the contact with either her or Brandon was by telephone. At times she managed to get him into the car but when they arrived at the appointment he absolutely refused to get out of the car in order to see the clinician due to his anxieties. Appointments were made appropriately by health care staff but contact with him by health professionals was via occasional telephone calls, when he agreed to speak to them. The last face to face contact with any member of the health care team was on the 31 May 2016 and his suicide occurred on the 9 August 2016. It was established that the efficacy of his care was compromised because of this lack of contact but Brandon was simply too anxious to attend out patients appointments and there was no provision or funding for the clinicians to go to Brandon’s home to treat him.",(1) That there is no provision of mental health care for children in Leicestershire who due to their anxiety are unable to attend hospital for treatment.

Schofield,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove","Amanda Spielman, Chief Executive, Ofsted",On 5 July 2017 I concluded the inquest into the death of Steffan Bonnot born 6 November 1988 (aged 17) who died on 1 January 2016. His inquest was originally opened on 12 January 2016. The conclusion that I reached at the inquest was that Steffan committed suicide. At the time of his death he was in the care of Brighton and Hove Local Authority.,"Steffan was a young man who has had spent a considerable amount of time in foster care and children's homes. He was due to move out of the Amicus Community Children's home and into another foster placement on 16 January 2016. It was clear from the evidence that he was concerned about leaving the Amicus Community and that he was anxious about whether or not the Foster Carers were fully appraised of his background. He had had a large number of Foster placements in the past many of which had broken down. The concerns he had about how much the Foster Carers knew caused him some anxiety. On Friday 1 January 2016 Steffan was amongst a small group of children who attended the local cinema. This was a pre-arranged outing. On the return from the cinema Steffan's group, which consisted of two staff and another child, stopped off at McDonald's. Shortly after arriving at McDonald's Steffan and the other young man went to the toilet. A member of staff followed them shortly afterwards and asked them to come out. Steffan did so but then left McDonald's without saying anything. The staff tried to follow him and locate him. They were unable to do so and sadly Steffan's body was later found at the Warningcamp foot crossing having been struck by a train. Steffan had deliberately knelt down in front of an oncoming train.","1. The author of the serious case review reported that the prospective foster carers who were to offer a placement to Steffan had advised that they had not been made fully aware of all the background to Steffan's case. This was, however, at odds with what Steffan's social worker told us. However, there was no formal documentation detailing exactly what had been disclosed. It was not therefore possible to be clear what information the prospective foster carer had been given. As we know, the failing to provide foster carers with all the background information was one of Steffan's major concerns and added to his level of anxiety about his move.

2. The above concern would apply equally to any individuals entrusted with the care of a child. All relevant information should be made available and it should be documented as to what has been provided so that the carers can make an informed decision before any placement is agreed. The young person could then be confident as to what the prospective carer/s knew. I consider that the issues raised in this case should be addressed so that future deaths do not occur in similar circumstances and that action should be taken to reduce the risk of deaths of other patients.","""born 6 November 1988 (aged 17) who died on 1 January 2016""; ""the conclusion that I reached at the inquest was that Steffan committed suicide""",True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8/3/2017. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide and the cause of death 1a asphyxia, 1b external airways obstruction.","The deceased had been anxious and suffering from low self-esteem for some time. She was concerned about her weight. There had been some recent family relationship difficulties and she experienced peer pressure at school relating to a stormy relationship that she had with her boyfriend. She had been referred to child and adult mental health services (CAMHS) in November 2015 by her GP but that referral was not accepted. She was referred again by her school on 20 October 2016. The following day she had contact with the CAMHS team who offered her an appointment which she declined because of difficulty accessing the venue. On 4 November 2016 the CAMHS team attempted unsuccessfully to contact the school referrer. On the same day her family perceived that she returned home from school unhappy. At about 1700 hours she went to her bedroom at her home address, [REDACTED], saying she had a migraine. At 1710 hours she received a text from her boyfriend saying he wished to end their relationship. At 1713 hours they spoke on the phone and she indicated to him that she was going to kill herself. At about 2200 hours her father went to her bedroom and found her on the bedroom floor with a plastic bag over her head tied underneath her chin. She was certified dead at the scene.","(1) At the inquest it was evident that Annabel had been referred by her GP to your team in November 2015 but that referral had not been accepted. She was referred again on 20/10/2016 by her school. This time the referral was accepted and your team made contact with her by telephone on 21/10/2016. She declined an appointment because she felt she could not get to the venue. No level of risk was recorded and next of kin details were not available. The date of appointment offered and declined were not recorded. Alternative time for appointment was not recorded. No follow up arrangements were recorded.
There was no attempt to contact Annabel thereafter. An unsuccessful attempt to contact the referrer was made on 4/11/2016 - the day Annabel took her own life.
The time period between referral and initial contact and attempted follow up appears considerable.
No attempt appears to have been made to engage with her parents who would have been in a position to assist with transport arrangements.

I recorded that the deceased on or around 8 September 2015 at her home address had taken a quantity of medication which was prescribed to other family members. At the time she had a number of medical and social issues which were being investigated.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a) Acute hypoxia due to 1b) morphine overdose

Conclusion – Deceased had taken her own life","The Inquest into the death of Rachal Murphy heard how a number of agencies were involved with Rachal and her family. Rachal had not been attending school for a long period of time. She was being investigated for epilepsy and it was reported by her family that she was having seizures on a daily basis. These were not confirmed on any of the investigations undertaken.

By 2014 there were concerns by professionals as to both the underlying cause of any medical condition but also her lack of schooling, her lack of interaction and underlying stressors which may have been impacting on any medical condition.

There was also some evidence that she had attempted to self harm but this was denied by her family.
The Court heard that by March 2015 they were concerned that there was no counsellor involved with Rachal. By this stage it was accepted by Rachal's Consultant that there should have been a referral to Child Adolescent Mental Health Services. The Court also heard that there was some confusion as to whether a direct referral could be made to the Clinical Psychology Services.

A CAF process had been commenced because of concerns about Rachal but there was a complete lack of progression for this process until the involvement of the Early Help Services. A meeting did take place on 17 June 2015 but having heard the evidence the Court found that at best from March 2015 there was a fractured, disjointed plan as to how to proceed with Rachal's care.

By the time of Rachal's death there was a complete lack of action in respect of the plan for Rachal. Those involved with her medical care wanted input from Mental Health Services to whom no referral had been made. Those involved with her social matters had wanted an outcome on her medical conditions.","GP SERVICES

1. There was a failure to undertake annual liver function tests in 2014 and 2015
2. The CAF documentation was completely overlooked and simply placed in the medical records as read only which led to no GP involvement in the inter-agency framework and handling of this case.

Tameside NHS FT and Pennine Care NHS FT

1. There was a lack of understanding between medical professionals as to the means by which someone could be referred to psychological services and whether there was an unclear message from psychological services as to whether they were accepting referrals.
2. Lack of understanding amongst medical professionals as to the cases which may or may not be suitable for referral to CAMHS.
3. There was a significant delay in the reporting of Rachal's EEG and the Court heard that this remained the case in respect of reporting of EEGs at the time of the Inquest.

Lynch,London South,Resuscitation Council (UK); South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust,"On 2 September 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Brennan, age 15. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 September 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was that Christopher died from asphyxia due to acute upper airway obstruction. The circumstances in which he came by his death were recorded by the jury in a narrative form, as follows:
Christopher suffered from mental illness and was a patient at Bethlem Adolescent Unit at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, Beckenham. He had a history of hearing voices, suicidal ideas, and self harm, usually by swallowing objects. On 31 August 2014 at about 8 pm, Christopher went to the communal toilet on the unit and obstructed his airway by swallowing the lid of a roll on deodorant wrapped in tissue paper. He called for help but suffered a cardiac arrest before the obstruction could be removed, and could not be resuscitated. Christopher's actions were in part because of cumulative and continuing failures in risk assessment and management. His death was contributed to by neglect.",,"(1) In respect of the in-patient management: that there was no separate policy or guidance, other than a pictorial wall chart, regarding the assessment and management of risks posed by items that might be used to cause self harm. The complexities of managing these risks on an adolescent in-patient psychiatric unit were not therefore adequately considered, and this led to a lack of clarity and consistency.

(2) With regard to resuscitation: the emergency equipment on the unit did not include a laryngoscope. The item obstructing Christopher's airway was subsequently used by ambulance personnel using Magill forceps with a laryngoscope, and this combination had been successfully used on a previous occasion when Christopher had swallowed a bottle top.

Laryngoscopes are not part of the standardised items on the unit, and are not included in the Resuscitation Council guidance for mental healthcare settings. It has been suggested that this is because they are complex devices that require intense training and competency assessments before staff can use them, and that it may be counterproductive to make them available. However, in view of the circumstances of Christopher's death, and the apparent prevalence of self harm in adolescent units, the matter is reported for consideration, both in relation to the laryngoscope itself and the access to staff trained in its use.","""Christopher Brennan, age 15""; ""history of hearing voices, suicidal ideas, and self harm""; ""obstructed his airway by swallowing the lid of a roll on deodorant""; ""Christopher's actions were in part because of cumulative and continuing failures in risk assessment and management""",True,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Brown,Northumberland,Chief Executive NEAS NHS Foundation Trust Yvonne Ormston; Chief Constable Steve Ashman Northumbria Police; Chief Fire Officer Paul Hedley Northumberland Fire and Rescue Service; Chief Executive Maritime and Coastguard Agency Sir Alan Massey,"On 7 April 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joshua Harry Smith aged 16 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 November 2016 with the following narrative conclusion:-
‘On 4 April 2015 Joshua Harry Smith aged 16 years attended a party at a friend’s house, Joshua drank some alcohol, but was not drunk. He seemed fine when Joshua’s father collected him; arriving home at 00.30 a.m. on 5 April 2015. At 02.15 a.m., Joshua contacted ambulance control by 999 call asking for an ambulance. He was below the cliffs near the southernmost part of Spittal Beach, (Northumberland) having fallen. Joshua had intended to jump from the cliff, then changed his mind, slipped and fell down the cliff to the bottom. Earlier text and Facebook messages showed that Joshua was thinking of taking his own life. After a prolonged search Joshua was eventually found clinging to a rock in the water at the base of the cliff at 04.01 a.m. There had been significant delays because Joshua’s first call to ambulance control advising his location as ‘Spittal’ was not heard until it was later played back, and while ambulance, police, fire and other agencies tried to locate Joshua. There was no indication that JESIP principles (Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Program) were followed regarding briefings or co-ordination of resources, and the Berwick ambulance crew felt that there was no search co-ordinator or person taking overall control. Other agencies did not feedback what resources they had committed to the incident. When Joshua was eventually located at 04.01 a.m., he lost his grip while holding onto a rock, and he was taken away from the shore by movement of the waves. An RAF Sea King helicopter by that time arrived and Joshua was winched out of the sea unconscious, and conveyed to Wansbeck General Hospital. Sadly Joshua’s death was confirmed at 06.15 a.m. at Wansbeck General Hospital.",,"At 2.15 a.m. when Joshua made his 999 call he stated to Ambulance control that he had fallen from a cliff near Spittal Beach (which is on the south side of the River Tweed) and injured himself, that he was alone and was unable to walk.

Police and other emergency services were not immediately alerted from the outset of the information provided in Joshua’s telephone call to 999. Joshua’s location could not be identified from the mobile phone call made to 999.

Two police officers on Berwick Town Centre duties (which is north of the River Tweed) were asked in the street by paramedics for assistance in locating Joshua, and while paramedics went to look for Joshua on the north side of Berwick near the Holiday Park and cliffs, the police officers travelled to Spittal looking for Joshua although they had no name or further details at that time. A brief search of Spittal Beach near to the cliffs by police officers was unsuccessful, before they returned to Town Centre duties. A report to Police Control was not made at that time.

The search for Joshua was briefly stood down after a North East Ambulance call to Joshua’s father indicated that Joshua was at home in his bedroom, without waiting to check and confirm whether Joshua was in fact in his bedroom.

The search for Joshua continued at Berwick Holiday Park (on the north side of the River Tweed and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed) as a result of his location at Spittal Beach not being recognised from his 999 call.

After Joshua’s phone call was ‘listened back’ it was observed that he had described his location as Spittal, at the bottom of a cliff, near Spittal Beach.

Joshua had explained in his 999 call that he was below cliffs having fallen, was injured and that an ambulance would not be able to reach him. The Hazardous Area Response Team of North East Ambulance was not deployed to the incident until approximately 3 a.m. arriving at the scene under an hour later and were 1.5 miles away from the incident at the time Joshua was swept out to sea by action of the waves.

The circumstances of the incident showed that although there were examples of good co-operation and effort among the emergency services, overall command, control and co-ordination were unclear and JESIP was not followed.","""Joshua Harry Smith aged 16 years""; ""Earlier text and Facebook messages showed that Joshua was thinking of taking his own life""; ""Joshua had intended to jump from the cliff, then changed his mind, slipped and fell down the cliff to the bottom""",True,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

In August 2012 she was seen for an emergency outpatient assessment and a planned inpatient admission was sought. However there were no specialist Child and Adolescent high dependency beds available immediately and Amy had to be admitted to the Priory Hospital at Roehampton.

3221,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/thomas-gallagher/,,2016-08-11,L. Hashmi,Greater Manchester North,Chief Constable for Greater Manchester Police,"On 25 July 2016, I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Martin Gallagher.","Tom was aged 16 years at the time of his death. He had been diagnosed as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and psychosis by a child psychiatrist. In the months before his death he received care and treatment as a voluntary inpatient at a specialist adolescent mental health unit, whilst within the community he received care and support from the child and adolescent mental health team (CAMHS).

He had a history of self-harm/attempted suicide, including an attempt at self-ligature.

On 10 July 2015 Tom had been working during the day and appeared relatively settled although he struggled to control the effects of his OCD. In the late afternoon/early evening, he became agitated and therefore decided to walk the dog in order to relieve the tension. He dropped the dog back home at around 19:30 but went straight out again. When he did not return home, his family tried to contact him on his mobile – by calls and text messaging. Tom failed to respond. This was unusual.

By 21:00 his family was becoming increasingly concerned and therefore carried out a search of the local area. At 02:44 on 11 July 2015, Tom’s father contacted Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to report that his son was missing. The call taker created a Force Wide Incident Note (FWIN - 0405), completed the ‘1-12’ and coded the call as requiring a Grade 2 response which meant that the call required priority attendance, allocating by the radio operator within 20 minutes and attendance by a police officer within 1 hour from the creation of the Incident Log.

Tom was correctly identified as a missing person.

From this point on, the FWIN was delayed on no less than 14 occasions; the family’s call therefore remained unallocated. Almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without rationale. No service call was made to Tom’s family and as no officer was allocated, the ‘Golden Hour’ (important in terms of information gathering) was missed. The Incident Response Protocol - in particular the Grade 2 FWIN Escalation Process - was not followed, the cross-border process was not instigated and neither ‘Silver Command’ nor the OCB supervisor were made aware of the problems that were being encountered in allocating resources to FWIN 0405.

On the night in question, GMP was experiencing what was described as an ‘unprecedented/unpredictable spike’ in Grade 1-3 calls. There was also an ongoing policing operation within the town centre and staffing levels were low. The deployable resources available to the duty Inspector were approximately 50% lower than those ‘on paper’. Staffing levels had been persistently lower than expected in the weeks before Tom’s death.

The low staffing levels of 10-11 July 2015 were recognised in good time and were brought to the attention of the DRMU and the senior leadership team (SLT) on Monday 6 July at a routine meeting. However whilst it was agreed that additional resources would be allocated to support the Friday/Saturday shift a Chief Inspector subsequently declined to allocate/authorise this as he felt that the levels were ‘within tolerance’. This change of decision was not conveyed to the duty sergeant (who had been present at the Monday meeting) and/or divisional duty Inspector.

At around 08:00 Tom’s father made a further call to GMP as he had not heard anything. In the meantime, [REDACTED] resumed the search for her son.

At 08:07, Tom was discovered by a member of the public suspended by ligature from a tree in the park close to his home. A 999 call was made and police attended immediately. The fact of Tom’s death was confirmed by paramedics at shortly before 08:30. Tom’s mother heard of her son’s death from a member of the public whilst trying to elicit information from an officer at the scene.

Following post mortem examination the medical cause of death was given as:

1a) Asphyxia

1b) Fatal pressure on the neck

1c) Hanging

At inquest GMP admitted shortcomings in the way that it responded to the family’s call for help.

The jury concluded suicide and added the following [sic]:

- Tom’s mental health issues
- Alteration in frequency of appointments with medical services due to transitional care
- The FWIN not being switched to supervisor after 20 minutes
- Lack of contact within the initial hour to the family
- Lack of justification for the delays on the FWIN
- It could not be concluded that the admitted shortcomings caused or contributed to the deceased’s death.

The jury also found that Tom died ‘before 02:44 on 11 July 2015’.","1. The lack of formal training in relation to risk assessment and child mental health.

2. Save for the initial call handler, that all staff demonstrated intentional disregard of Force policies and protocols - including those with operational/management responsibilities and the Operational Communications Branch (OCB - see above).

3. That the Force has no set minimum staffing levels, including within divisional response and the OCB.

4. That when the persistently low staffing levels were brought to the attention of GMP’s SLT, on more than one occasion, insufficient action was taken so as to ensure that the number of officers on duty matched those identified as being required ‘on paper’.

5. That when decisions were taken not to allocate additional cover/resources:

i) no rationale was recorded,

ii) no minutes were kept in relation to the decisions taken during the Monday meeting

iii) no contemporaneous record was made by the Chief Inspector regarding his decision to reverse the earlier agreement to allocate additional resources

&,

iv) the Chief Inspector did not communicate his decision to those who needed to know.

6. Despite hearing evidence on the positive steps taken by GMP since Tom’s death, there was no solid evidence of resource commitment to prevent recurrence.

7. That there were 14 delays placed on FWIN 0405.

8. That almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without written rationale.

9. That FWIN 0405 went unallocated (despite some evidence of attempts to resource) resulting in the very important ‘Golden Hour’ being missed.

It was clear from the initial ‘1-12’ and the additional information recorded by the call taker within FWIN 0405 that Tom was not only vulnerable by virtue of his age but also due to the fact that he had complex mental health issues, the significance of which was arguably underestimated as a result of point 1 above.

It was accepted during the course of the evidence that the ‘1-12’ had been an initial assessment of risk only.

10.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 June 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was a short form suicide with narrative conclusion. The medical cause of death was 1A - vasovagal inhibition as a result of 1B - hanging.","This 17 year old young lady “Anielka” was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in March 2010, aged 12 years and she suffered a stroke. She underwent a heart transplant in April 2010. Post procedure she recovered well from a cardiac perspective. However, she developed complicated neuro-psychological problems arising from the brain injury caused by the stroke. Anielka’s home life was difficult, and she was often reluctant to engage with professionals. She engaged in risk taking behaviours, which included on occasion self-harming, alcohol, illicit drug use, and becoming involved in inappropriate relationships. In December 2014, Anielka was taken off a child protection plan which had been in place since 2011. Her care was being transitioned from child and young person’s services to adult services. Multiple agencies were involved with Anielka’s care, and her complex needs were identified. However, no lead professional was identified to coordinate her care. On more than one occasion the agencies did not communicate with each other. This led to missed opportunities to provide a structured care plan for Anielka. In January 2015, Anielka drew on her bedroom walls a number of images which indicated suicidal intent. Local mental health services were not made aware of this. On the 4 February 2015, she attended her final appointment at the children’s transplant clinic. She travelled to Great Ormond Street with her father. Her journey was delayed by a fatality occurring on the railway line. She was also very upset after reading a report that referred to her ongoing need for support and services. The following day on the 5 February 2015, she left her flat in Gloucester City Centre at approximately 1000hrs. She made her way to her training college. She then departed for home. Her father returned home at about 1500 hours and found Anielka hanging by the neck from the bannister. A dressing gown cord had been used as the ligature. Her father cut her down and dialled emergency services. Paramedics arrived shortly thereafter and pronounced Anielka deceased at 1510 hours. Police are satisfied there are no suspicious circumstances.

Harris,London Inner South,"Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Ministry of Justice; Mr Will Tuckley, Chief Executive, London Borough of Tower Hamlets; [REDACTED] Director of Fitness to Practise Directorate, General Medical Council","An inquest hearing at Southwark Coroner's Court touching the death of: Imran Douglas, who died on 13 November 2013, in HM Prison, Belmarsh, Case Ref: 002952-2013 was concluded before a jury on 3 November 2015. The jury's conclusion as to the death was suicide.","The circumstances that the jury recorded are complex and lengthy, despite the direction to be brief, reflecting multiple contributing factors to the death. They are laid out in an attached Record of Inquest, to enable the Ministry of Justice to understand the systemic failings throughout his detention, especially in the light of the Harris Review. Four particular significant contributory factors are relevant to this report:
i) A lack of Transition Planning
ii) Systemic lack of communication between and within almost all agencies
iii) The problem of overlapping databases, not all accessible to every agency
iv) Problems in handling the deceased at HMP Belmarsh

In summary of the circumstances, Mr Douglas suffered from brain injury, after a car accident aged 16. He suffered impulsivity, mood swings, and suicidal ideation afterwards. He was arrested and charged with murder aged 17, and entered custody in a special training centre, where his Youth Offending Team (YOT) worker recorded risk of suicide and a previous attempt. He was closely monitored and means of self-harm removed and this was documented in a Suicide and Self Harm Form (SASH).

The YOT recorded in a Placement Form on 29/05/13 that Mr Douglas would kill himself, using his clothes for suspension, if he is given a long sentence, and this was included in subsequent Placement Forms available on the E Asset System. He was admitted under s48/49 MHA for psychiatric assessment, but the psychiatrist had no recollection of seeing the SASH form, recorded no significant deliberate self-harm and concluded he was of low suicide risk and not mentally ill, but vulnerable and impulsive on discharge. He was to be transferred to Feltham A YOI on 17/09/13. It appeared that neither Feltham staff, nor the YOT attended the CPA meeting, nor was his mother invited, so that the records did not represent the YOT worker's concerns about his risk nor his past suicidal behaviour. Feltham records never included the SASH, nor the YOT worker's concerns, and there was a dispute as to what discussions did take place between the YOT worker and a lead prison officer. Risk assessments and placement forms including suicidal behaviour and his medium risk of self-harm were available to Feltham staff on the E Asset system. The prison officer agreed that had she seen them, an ACCT would have been opened (this is a prison suicide risk warning form, leading staff alerts and to close supervision). Despite a recommendation that he should have mental health supervision, and not knowing the past history, a nurse at Feltham discharged him from the mental health team.

There was a failure of Transition Planning, with social workers not being invited to a Transition meeting and the Head of Young People failing to contact the Youth Justice Board (YJB), Population Management Unit (PMU), for Feltham B, despite his approaching his 18th birthday on 11/10/13. He attended court on 07/10/13, where he changed his plea to guilty and was observed to have a change of mood. On 07/10/13, YJB sent three Service Placement Confirmations to YOT, Feltham and escort staff, which indicated that he was a suicide risk and he returned to Feltham A. His offender supervisor did not see him between plea and sentence and there was no apparent consideration of the impact of his change of plea to guilty. The YOT worker thought a Transition Plan had been made, in line with his wishes, for him to transfer to Feltham B, when he appeared in court for sentencing on 08/11/13 and that the YJB would organise this. A YJB spokesperson explained that she had no power to do this, as it was outside the young offenders estate and Mr Douglas was no longer a young offender. The Feltham Governor thought the plan was for him to return to A and later transfer to B, but this was not written down anywhere. In the event, the deceased was sent to court on 08/11/13, with all his belongings, with no indication of suicide risk nor “endorsement” on his prison escort record that he was to return, which the jury concluded meant he was not to return to Feltham A. He received an 18 year sentence, which was much longer than he anticipated and the YOT and escort staff were concerned about the effect of the sentence on him. His behaviour changed led to an escort officer opening a suicide and deliberate self-harm warning form. A YJB spokesperson advised that Feltham A had no authority to accept an adult, although on the phone to escort staff, they had agreed to have him back, they declined when the PMU rang. The court heard that Feltham A had 40 vacancies, but Feltham B was full, and the PMU allocated him to go to Belmarsh. The deputy director of Public Sector Prisons expressed surprise at this decision; the YOT worker agreed it was not a suitable placement. The jury recorded that there was no hotline between YJB and PMU for urgent borderline cases, nor a protocol to specifically speak to the YOI governor.

In Belmarsh two officers and a nurse saw him in rapid succession, registering no concerns about his state of mind or age, with a nurse disregarding the court staff suicide warning form (it is noted that this nurse is no longer in the UK nor on the UK GNC register). No discipline staff, nor health care staff considered he needed an ACCT opening, although the duty governor considered it should have been, on the basis of his sentence and age alone. Had the warning form been seen by the First Night Centre, it is widely agreed that an ACCT would have been opened, but it never was.

He received a medical assessment by a doctor who did see the court suicide warning form, but thought there was no risk of self-harm, no need for observation nor referral, with no documentary evidence of history or examination and whose only records entry was “feels ok”. Another nurse relied heavily on the prisoner's denial of suicidal intent. The jury noted that staff in Belmarsh did not have access to the E Asset system in YOIs. On the next day he was seen by a nurse whose secondary assessment was perfunctory and conducted without consultation with his electronic medical records (this nurse is not currently registered with the GNC). He was classed as a Vulnerable Prisoner due to high media interest, but officers were not initially aware of this and he was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day before his suicide on the fifth day in HMP Belmarsh.","1. The system of placements at transition

The YOT worker said that it was a problem having a sudden change of duties aged 18 and it would be better if legal duties were kept in parallel with their work until the Transition Plan was completed. The Head of Placements and Safeguarding at YJB was taken to an extract of the YOT worker’s reflections on the operation of the transition system, in which she said that historically there was an approach that when you are 18, our role just stops (that did not occur here). The famous civil servant, [REDACTED], said that “officials are the servants of the public and the official must not try to foster the illusion it is the other way round”. She was asked whether Imran Douglas had to fit into the system rather than the system serve him. She agreed that a more flexible policy was needed. She agreed that the Transition Process was bureaucratic, and to work, it depended on good will. She agreed that there was an inherent risk from the statutory change of duties at 18, especially when staff were under pressure, but was concerned if legislative change adds to bureaucracy. The Deputy Director of NOMS agreed that it made no sense that there was a legal handover of roles at 18 years: it would be better if handover of responsibility took place when the Transition Plan was completed.

I consider that there is an outstanding risk that, when a rising 18 enters the criminal justice system with insufficient time for the normal Transition Plan, and especially when staff are under pressure, that even with the changes in placements from courts that have been made, and the Joint National Protocol, the knowledge and expertise of the YOT and YJB may not be properly considered in a placement if the legal duty for placement has passed to the PMU before the Plan is complete. The Secretary of State is asked to consider whether a person-based rather than rule-based system would be safer, by legislating to allow flexibility for YJB and YOTs to decide when the duty for placement is passed to the PMU, in line with the completion of the person’s Transition Plan, rather than rigidly on the 18th birthday.

2. The adequacy of knowledge and interagency working between social care in London Borough of Tower Hamlets and the secure estate.

Evidence pointed to a disconnection between Looked After Child pathway planning and Transition Planning. A social worker said that the LAC plan was “potentially informative” but did not matter if it was not completed, but that now it is regarded as key and should be shared. One social worker said she did not know what a Transition Plan was. The current Head of Children’s Social Care at LB Tower Hamlets said that staff pressures at the time had eased somewhat, but that under her leadership the interface with the secure estate was through the YJB and so social workers do not directly talk to the secure estate staff. This was despite the requirement for the two to work together in the Youth to Adult Transitions Framework. Given the lack of documented communications of risks and concerns between YOT and Feltham in 2013, this evidence throws doubt on the reported improvements in training and changes in interagency communication that have been put into operation since.

3. The adequacy of electronic communication systems between agencies

The jury criticised the lack of access of HMP Belmarsh to the E Asset system and the fact that key documents from the Secure Training Centre were never accessed by the secure estate. The lack of a universal system of records throughout the offender’s pathway results in information on risk not being known to others and may contribute to future deaths.

4. The competence of a medical practitioner, who no longer is employed in health care in HMP Belmarsh, but is on the GMC register and may practise elsewhere and as a general practitioner.

The GP did not record history or examination or propose any interventions despite being aware of the young age, long sentence and suicide warning from court. The clinical review conducted as part of the Prison and Probation Ombudsman’s Report concluded that health care provision in HMP Belmarsh was below the standard expected.

Although a ""safety plan"" is prepared by CAMHS at the time of discharge from hospital, there does not appear to be sufficient input to this document by DSS with the result that those caring for a young person at risk may have incomplete written information available to them to properly ensure the safety of the young person.
2. A delay in scheduling an appropriate meeting of professionals resulted in a missed opportunity to provide support and protection of a young person at risk and there was not therefore a prompt response to a crisis.
3.

Leeming,Greater Manchester West,"The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt, Minister for Health; The Rt Hon Nicky Morgan, Minister for Education; The Rt Hon Eric Pickles, Minister for Local Government","On 4 April 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin, aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 March 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had committed suicide. The medical cause of her death was 1a hanging.","On the 15 July 2003 a Care Order relating to Aleysha McLoughlin was made at Manchester County Court upon the application of Bolton Council.

Aleysha was then placed with a family member, where she remained settled until 9 September 2012 when she went to stay with her mother and refused to return. On 8 October Aleysha left her mother's address and although there was a short period thereafter when Aleysha returned to live with her family member the placement broke down. Accordingly on 26 November 2012 Aleysha was placed with a foster carer where she remained until her death in April 2014. As the foster carer lived in a different area Aleysha also changed schools, and at first she appeared to make a positive start at her new school. However from in or about March 2013 her schoolwork and behaviour began to deteriorate.

Likewise Aleysha appeared to settle well with her foster carer. However on 13 March 2013 she left her foster carer's home and did not return until 20 March 2013. When asked where she had been Aleysha said that she had been with her mother.

In early June 2013 the head of Aleysha's year at school had a preventative meeting with her and her foster carer to address a perceived deterioration in Aleysha's behaviour. Aleysha did not engage at that meeting, and her behaviour was perceived to continue to be poor.

On or about 8 June 2013 Aleysha again left her foster carer's home and did not return until 20 June, on this occasion saying that she had been with her sister.

On 25 June 2013 whilst Aleysha's sister was visiting her at her foster carer's home Aleysha reported to her carer that her sister had taken an overdose. The following evening, 27 June, Aleysha herself took an overdose of aspirin and paracetamol. She was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where she initially refused treatment, and even after consenting she later removed the cannula administering intravenous medication and had to be persuaded to have it restored. During Aleysha's hospital admission clinicians from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) assessed her and a further appointment was made for her to see a CAMHS clinical psychologist after her discharge from hospital. On 5 July 2013 Aleysha attended that appointment with her foster carer. Aleysha did not want any further involvement with CAMHS and as Aleysha's risk of further self harm was, for various reasons, believed to be reduced, it was decided that there was no ongoing role for CAMHS at that time, although an offer of re-referral was made should matters change.

When Aleysha returned to school after the summer holiday in September 2013 she was perceived as continuing to be uncooperative and difficult to engage.

On a date between in or about October 2013 and at or about Christmas of 2013 one of the Social Workers involved with Aleysha was informed by Aleysha's foster carer that Aleysha had inflicted some superficial cuts upon herself. The social worker believed that this was a historical event and did not ask Aleysha about it.

On 7 January 2014 Aleysha and her sister both took overdoses of aspirin and they were taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital. Clinicians wanted to admit Aleysha to the hospital for observation because she was believed to have taken a potentially life threatening overdose, but Aleysha refused to be admitted. She was seen by a Doctor in the Accident and Emergency Department of the Hospital, who decided that she had the capacity to refuse treatment and noted that she was discharged. Aleysha was subsequently seen by a Doctor specialising in mental health, who had concerns that Aleysha did not, in fact, have the capacity to refuse treatment. However medical staff would not then admit Aleysha to the hospital because a medical doctor had discharged her. Whilst discussions about this were continuing Aleysha left the hospital with her sister, who was also refusing treatment. Aleysha and her sister were returned to the hospital the following morning, and a mental health nurse who was a member of the Rapid Assessment Interface Discharge (RAID) team then assessed Aleysha. Aleysha continued to refuse to be admitted to hospital and was then assessed to have the capacity to make that decision. In the course of the assessment Aleysha told the mental health nurse that she had self-harmed by cutting herself, although she had not done that recently. That information was not passed to other agencies. Particularly it was not contained in the information subsequently passed to CAMHS nor was it given to Social Services nor Aleysha's school. During the assessment Aleysha stated that she did not then want to end her life but that she had wanted to do so at the time when she had taken the overdose. At the conclusion of the assessment it was determined that whilst Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self harm she was at ongoing risk of impulsive self harm, and arrangements were made for her to have an appointment with CAMHS, despite Aleysha stating that she would not attend. Aleysha was also referred to the Safeguarding Children Team at the Royal Bolton Hospital.

On 8 January 2014 Aleysha was seen by her school nurse, who had been informed of her hospital attendance by the Safeguarding team. Aleysha declined further support from the nurse, who did not then contact Aleysha again.

On 8 February 2014 Aleysha and her sister were seen to be on the wrong side of the fencing of a road bridge where they were at risk of jumping or falling onto the carriageway below. Police Officers attended, and Aleysha walked off the bridge. She was then detained by the Police under the terms of the Mental Health Act and taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital, where she was seen by two Doctors specialising in psychiatry and an Approved Mental Health Professional who was a social worker, for the purpose of a Mental Health Act assessment. Aleysha did not fully engage during the assessment, and denied that she had intended to harm herself when she had been on the bridge. The assessment concluded that Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self-harm, but that she remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm. Aleysha was then discharged from detention under the Mental Health Act. A further referral was made to the Safeguarding team and to CAMHS, although Aleysha again said that she would not attend at CAMHS, stating that she didn't need it. On 11 February 2014 a secretary working for the CAMHS team telephoned Aleysha and offered her an appointment with a mental health practitioner on 17 February, which Aleysha refused. On 18 February a social worker contacted a mental health nurse at CAMHS in order to share information regarding Aleysha particularly with regard to the events of 8 February described above. The ensuing discussion included an acknowledgement of the risks presented to Aleysha as a consequence of her impulsive behaviour when she was with her sister. Aleysha's refusal to engage with CAMHS was also discussed and the Social Worker planned that Aleysha's foster carer should be contacted and asked to encourage Aleysha to attend an appointment with CAMHS. On 25 February a multi agency meeting was held by social services to address Aleysha's self harming behaviour and her refusal to engage with CAMHS. CAMHS were not invited to this, nor to any other meeting. It was agreed that in view of Aleysha's refusal to engage with mental health services her foster carer should receive some training as to means of promoting Aleysha's engagement with those services. This training had not been put into place by the time of Aleysha's death on 3 April 2014.

On 6 March 2014 Aleysha was excluded from school for five days due to her bad behaviour. A meeting took place with Aleysha and her foster carer and an individual programme of lessons was agreed, so as to support Aleysha during the period leading up to her forthcoming public examinations.

On 2 April 2014 a pupil at Aleysha's school told Aleysha's head of year that Aleysha had self-harmed by cutting her arms. Aleysha's social worker and her foster carer were informed and when they saw Aleysha an ambulance was summoned and Aleysha was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital with her foster carer following. When Aleysha was treated she was found to have twenty-nine recent lacerations on her left arm, together with scarring from older wounds. Neither Aleysha's foster carer nor Social Services had previously been aware that Aleysha was self-harming to this level. Whilst Aleysha's wound were being closed the treating nurse asked Aleysha if she wanted to see anyone from the RAID team, but Aleysha declined. Despite this the nurse contacted the RAID team and a mental health nurse assessed Aleysha. The assessment concluded that on this occasion Aleysha's self-harm was not an acute incident of attempted suicide but that Aleysha remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm. The means of treating this risk was ongoing psychological therapy such as was offered by CAMHS and the nurse conducting the assessment encouraged Aleysha to attend CAMHS despite her expressed reluctance to do so.

At about 3pm on 3 April 2014 Aleysha was found deceased by her foster carer at their home address [REDACTED]. She had hanged herself. Prior to her death she had been researching websites relating to suicide and hanging. She had also taken amphetamine, which could have induced depression.","Evidence was given at the inquest that self harm in young people is becoming a public health crisis. Evidence revealed that 3 out of 10 young people have self harmed at some time during their lives. Accordingly the matters of concern revealed were as follows:

(1) That it should be considered that the system of training for those working with young people, including teachers, school nurses, foster carers, social workers, mental health workers and medical nurses and doctors should be reviewed so as to ensure that these professionals should be alert for signs of self harm and should take opportunities to discover themselves so that those harming themselves can be offered help and support. By way of example evidence was given at the inquest that the annual health check offered to looked after children did not include a blood pressure check. If a blood pressure check was included this would provide an opportunity for signs of self harm to be revealed.

(2) That it should be considered that additional information and encouragement could be offered to young people to inform those able to help for example teachers, nurses, health professionals etc, when a young person becomes aware that another young person is self harming. The shocking self harm to which Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had subjected herself was only revealed when a school friend brought it to the attention of a teacher. There was no evidence that there was any system in place to encourage the passing of such information.

(3) That it should be considered that systems such as those now being developed in Bolton should be further developed so as to ensure that multi agency discussions involving all relevant agencies are held urgently for those at risk of self harm and particularly for those who do not engage. Evidence was given that meetings concerning Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin did not include the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services although evidence was given that their input would have been valuable.

(4) That it should be considered that a particular pathway of help for young people who resist engagement should be developed. There was no evidence that any such formal pathway had been shared at the present time.

(5) That a review of the capacity of the agencies involved in helping young people who are self harming to address those matters appropriately should be considered.","""aged 16""; ""Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had committed suicide""; ""medical cause of her death was 1a hanging""",True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

Harding,Kent Mid and Medway,Secretary of State for Justice; Tower Hamlets; Medway Youth Offending Team; Governor Cookham Wood; Oxleas,"On 1 February 2012 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alex Kelly age 15. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 December 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was that Alex Kelly died from a hypoxic brain injury having suspended himself on 24 January 2012 from a ligature made from his shoelaces which was attached to a locker within his cell at Cookham Wood Young Offenders Institution where he was serving a sentence. He died at Medway Maritime Hospital on 25 January 2012.

The jury were unable to determine his intention in suspending himself but found that his emotional state was significantly compromised at the time.

The jury further concluded:
1. That there was a systemic failure by Tower Hamlets Social Services to allocate a named social worker which hampered communication with other agencies, the ability to address ongoing concerns about Alex's mental health issues and his continuity of care all of which led to an inadequate level of support for a vulnerable looked after child. Additionally Tower Hamlets failed to address Alex's placement on release, his wish to see his grandmother.
2. At Cookham Wood Young Offenders Institution the effective sharing and evaluation of important information was hampered by the number of different types of systems used to record information concerning Alex Kelly, a lack of communication between staff and departments and a lack of communication with external parties all of which led to a reduced ability to safeguard Alex effectively. Additionally a review of the safeguarding provisions on 24 January 2012 should have included requesting Alex to move to a supervision cell for the night and maintain constant observations and removing his laces.","Alex Kelly was a vulnerable and immature 15 year old who had suffered repeated serious sexual abuse as a very young child. He became a looked after child at the age of 6 with Tower Hamlets the Corporate Parent. He was fostered for 10 years with a family in Medway. In early adolescence Alex developed identity issues. He had variously been diagnosed with ADHD, and assessed as mildly autistic but it was common ground that his deep rooted problems had never really been addressed in the community.

Alex first became involved with the Youth Courts in 2010 and until August 2011 appeared repeatedly before the Youth Courts having offended and breached orders. On 1 August 2011 Alex was remanded to Cookham Wood YOI and was later bailed on 9 August 2011. This was his first time in custody. On 10 October 2011 he was further remanded to Cookham Wood and sentenced the following day to a 10 month DTO.

Whilst in custody Alex was diagnosed by a psychiatrist within the mental health in-reach team with ADHD and conduct disorder and was prescribed medication.

Alex initially engaged well with the regime but his behaviour began to deteriorate in December 2011 and an ACCT was opened on 23 December 2011 because of his low mood and a refusal to engage in education, activities and association. The ACCT was closed on 3 January 2012 but reopened on the 6th and remained open until his death. A Behaviour Improvement Plan designed to encourage him to engage was opened on 29 December 2011 and remained open until late January. Throughout January 2012 Alex received a number of adjudication awards for blocking the observation panel to his cell or tattooing. Awards prevented him from engaging as envisaged by the Behaviour Improvement Plan.

Alex had repeatedly made marks on his arms throughout January 2012 which were variously regarded as tattooing or self-harm.

Alex's presentation throughout the period was variable, sometimes appearing in relatively good spirits but very often refusing to engage and remaining in his cell. Alex made a number of threats to take his own life by 'stringing up' but when tasked about this issue smiled or appeared to prison staff to treat it as a joke. He progressed to writing notes to the same effect and then to making ligatures with his shoelaces.

On the evening of 24 January 2012 Alex for the first time spoke of the sexual abuse that he had suffered and indicated it was all he ever thought about. He said he wanted to kill himself and that there wasn't anything officers could do about it as there would be sufficient time between observations. A short time later he telephoned his foster carers and was seen to be upset and after started to cry but stopped himself when an officer noticed. He then told another officer who had a good relationship with him and who had been asked to speak with him because he was upset, that he was going to hang himself. He repeated this to the same officer a short time later. Officers thereafter responsible for observing Alex were not informed of these disclosures.

Alex's observations were around this time increased from 3 to 5x hour.

He was seen inside his cell drinking a hot chocolate at which time his observation panel was partially blocked. When an officer next went to check 15 minutes later there was no response and the panel was blocked. Officers entered his cell 4 minutes later to find him hanging from his shoelaces which were tied to a locker

Whilst he was at Cookham Wood YOI Alex had repeatedly stated he wanted to see his grandmother and from the beginning of January 2012 had stated that he did not want to return to his foster parents on release. At the time of his death his placement was unresolved and a number of telephone calls Alex made before he died were seeking to find a placement with people he knew","Re: Secretary of State for Justice

Alex Kelly, a vulnerable looked after child of 15 years with complex unresolved emotional issues and undiagnosed mental health issues, was sentenced to a Detention and Training Order to be served at a Young Offender’s Institution without the benefit of a forensic psychiatric assessment. Whilst I heard evidence from a psychiatrist associated with Cookham Wood YOI that the mental health in-reach team were able to address Alex’s mental health needs whilst in custody, I am aware of the deaths of a number of other children in custody who similarly had not had forensic psychiatric assessments and it is for this reason I am reporting the concern. Whilst hearing evidence in relation to lessons learned, I heard from the Service Manager of Medway Youth Offending Team that they have now secured the services of a psychiatric mental health nurse to assist them in the effective management of the young people for whom they have responsibilities, which I was told was proving effective and is to be continued.

Alex Kelly was under an ACCT between 23 December 2011 and 3 January 2012 and 6 January 2012 until his death. During the operation of the ACCT there was a continued conflict between the ACCT process and disciplinary procedures; outside agencies and carers were not asked to contribute; specific acts by Alex were seen as obstructive/challenging behaviour rather than signs of distress or a means of communicating that he needed help (his foster carers who had not been asked to contribute had some experience of Alex using non-verbal methods of communication); the ACCT reviews tended to focus on addressing specific or recent behaviours rather than the reason for the behaviour; although Alex was frequently mentioned at weekly safer regimes multidisciplinary meetings, a holistic approach was never adopted as to how he could best be supported or whether the YOI could support his needs.

Re: Tower Hamlets

1. Allocation
a) Alex Kelly was without a named social worker for a period of two months at a time when he was in danger of being sent to custody and after he was sent to custody. Difficulties in allocation were not escalated to senior management.

2. IT
a) Social workers did not transfer documentation including emails onto Framework i in a timely manner or at all.
b) There was no system in place for ensuring that urgent electronic communications were flagged/diverted when the recipient was absent from work.

3. Custody
a) Social workers did not all appear to appreciate that their responsibilities as Corporate Parent included a role in a looked after child’s welfare whilst in custody.

Re: Medway Youth Offending Team

1. Involvement with other agencies
a) Shortcomings in other agencies which affected the ability of the YOT to manage the young person were not brought to the attention of management.

2. Placement within the Secure Estate
a) There were inconsistencies in recommendations as to placement in a STC/YOI which were not reconciled.
b) Youth Offending Team keyworkers did not all appear to appreciate that their responsibilities included a role in the young person’s welfare whilst in custody.
c) Members of the Youth Offending Team did not all appear to appreciate that the Youth Offending Team could initiate a transfer within the secure estate.

3. Caseworker based at Cookham Wood YOI
a) Outside agencies sharing responsibility of the welfare of a young person in custody and foster carers were not kept informed of significant events, asked to participate in ACCT reviews or asked for input into the management of the young person.
b) Although involved in the ACCT reviews, the caseworker was unaware of the range of options available to safely manage the young person including requests to transfer to a different type of secure accommodation and the use of enhanced reviews.
c) Paperwork was not submitted for early release on the basis of non-compliance with the regime and concerns about absence of a placement without consultation with any person responsible for making decisions in relation to early release.

Re: Cookham Wood YOI

1. Communication with outside agencies
a) Outside agencies sharing responsibility of the welfare of a young person in custody and foster carers were not kept informed of significant events, asked to participate in ACCT reviews or asked for input into the management of the young person.

2. ACCT
a) Officers were inconsistent in the recording of significant events; entries being made in either the wing observation log, ACCT ongoing record or not at all.
b) At least one officer did not appear to appreciate the importance of significant incidents/disclosures or report them.
c) Significant events in a lengthy ongoing record were not highlighted and therefore not obvious to officers reviewing safeguarding provisions.
d) Officers were unaware of the need to involve outside agencies in the ACCT review process, the range of options available to them to safely manage the young person including requests to transfer to a different type of secure accommodation and the use of enhanced reviews.
e) The safer regimes meetings were not provided with all relevant information and were not used to their full effect. The minutes of the meetings were not fully recorded.
f) A holistic approach was not taken to the safe management of the young person during ACCT reviews or Safer Regimes meetings when it was apparent that he was struggling with the regime and that interventions were not working.

3. Conflict between Regimes
a) Officers did not always seek advice before placing the young person on report for tattooing when there was an indication in the ACCT documentation that adjudication awards would lead to a heightened risk of self-harm.
b) There was a conflict between the use of a behaviour improvement plan and adjudications which was not recognised at the time.

4. Early Release
a) Paperwork was not submitted for early release on the basis of non-compliance with the regime and concerns about absence of a placement without consultation with any person responsible for making decisions in relation to early release.

5. Cell entry
a) There appeared to be an inflexible approach to cell entry requiring the presence of three prison officers even though YOI was in patrol state and concerns were sufficient to require entry.

Re: Healthcare at Cookham Wood

NB: the service provider has changed since the death of Alex Kelly. The new provider is in the process of determining the systems and procedures being put in place at Cookham Wood.

1. Sharing of Information
a) Officers concerned with the management of the young person were not informed in terms of his non-compliance with medication and the potential effect of the failure to take the medication.

2. Medication management
a) Medication was found stockpiled in the young person’s cell; staff dispensing medication had not ensured it had been taken when it was probably recorded as having been taken.
b) Any failure to take medication was not sufficiently flagged for healthcare/prison staff to deal with the issue.

3. Recording of information
a) Not all occasions when the young person was seen by the in-reach team were recorded on System One.","""Alex Kelly age 15""; ""died from a hypoxic brain injury having suspended himself on 24 January 2012 from a ligature made from his shoelaces""; ""The jury were unable to determine his intention in suspending himself but found that his emotional state was significantly compromised at the time""; ""Alex made a number of threats to take his own life by 'stringing up'...

Brown,"County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay",Devon Clinical Commissioning Group; NHS England,"On 26 August 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of George Christian Werb aged 15. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 October 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative verdict: George died on 28 June 2013 on the railway track at Seaton Station, Seaton, Devon. At that time he was on home leave from inpatient care in a child psychiatric unit. Before he went on leave he was assessed as having no suicidal risk but the information used in this assessment was incomplete, inaccurate and did not reflect the actual situation. Poor engagement with the family, placing him in a unit a long distance from home, absent note keeping and inadequate internal communications all contributed to this outcome.","George Christian Werb was receiving treatment for serious mental health issues, including a probable diagnosis of psychosis and depression, and was detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act and admitted to the Priory Hospital, Southampton 23 May 2014 for treatment. This was the nearest unit available for a child with George's needs, notwithstanding this was more than a 2 hour drive away from the home address, and friend and family support. George continued to receive treatment for a number of weeks, then the Section was lifted, and periods of home leave were commenced.

The second of these periods of home leave commenced on 27 June 2014, notwithstanding that the situation had not been effectively risk assessed. Communication with the family was poor and due to the distance between the treating hospital and home address. No family therapy had been undertaken and the family had not received appropriate and full information of their son's diagnosis and the risk of suicide had not been adequately considered before leave was allowed.

George walked onto a railway track near his home the morning after his home leave commenced and died when he was hit by an express train.","(1) The community team had to spend much time making numerous telephone calls to locate a child psychiatric bed. There was not at the time, and still appears to be no, or no effective bed bureau system to identify spaces. This is wasteful of clinician time, creates inevitable delays and is indicative that there are routinely too few available beds to serve the needs of our child psychiatric patients.
(2) On a previous admission during May 2014 the bed located was in Huntercombe, and George was removed by his father as the bedroom had inadequate furniture, had no bed linen and there was concern the environment was adding to George's distress. The distance between home and this placement was in excess of 3 hours travel time.
(3) On the index admission, George was placed in the Priory Hospital, Southampton, a distance of over 2 hours travelling time from home. This is not an NHS facility and is specifically for ""overflow"" patients from all across England, many of whom are therefore huge distances from their home, their family, their friends and community support.
(4) Due to the distance, the hospital made the decision that family therapy could not take place (although the parents would have engaged if the importance of this was explained) and periods of home leave were extended due to travelling times, rather than in response to clinical need.
(5) There was poor attendance at the CPA meeting, and both parents and the community team only ""attended"" by telephone, which was far from ideal and impacted on the effectiveness of communication between all parties.
(6) Having local accessibility where in patient care is required was recognised in the Mental Health Crisis Care Concordat published 18 February 2014 to be important to keep the young person close to home, school and friends and this was also recognised by all the clinicians at inquest to be important and necessary. With current provision of beds this need is not being met, and is impacting on patient care.
(7) In this case I consider the distance of the unit directly contributed to the circumstances that led to George's death.","""George Christian Werb aged 15""; ""child psychiatric unit""; ""risk of suicide had not been adequately considered before leave was allowed""; ""George walked onto a railway track near his home the morning after his home leave commenced and died when he was hit by an express train""",True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Ridley,Wiltshire and Swindon,"Mr Nick Walkley, Chief Executive, Haringey Council","On 16 January 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mary Elizabeth Grace Stroman, aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of a two day inquest on 16 October 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mary took her own life whilst suffering from Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. On 15 January 2014 she lay down on a railway line and was struck by a train between the stations of Westbury and Trowbridge in Wiltshire and died as result of multiple injuries.","Back in 2010 Mary’s family lived in Hackney and her GP was based in Islington. Problems began to appear towards the end of 2010 that resulted in Mary becoming a voluntary inpatient at the Priory North in December 2010. I found as a fact that Mary’s Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that was subsequently diagnosed in 2011 was linked to mental trauma sustained as a result of episode(s) of sexual abuse. Expert opinion suggested that the index episode may have occurred 12 months prior to this possibly slightly earlier than that. There more likely than not were repeated incidents. The family moved to Haringey in the summer of 2011. It is quite clear from the evidence that I heard that there were concerns from a safeguarding perspective in relation to Mary’s safety away from the family home in the community and in 2012 as early as February 2012 the Consultant Adolescent Child Psychiatrist, and part of the Whittington Healthcare Trust was of the view that Mary would benefit from long term therapeutic placement for up to 3 years which could meet her educational needs whilst maintaining her safety away from the area and in particular the London Borough of Islington. That placement finally began in June 2013. In Wiltshire she was seen by the last consultation was 7 January 2014 where Mary was not exhibiting suicidal ideation or indicating a plan. For some reason which is unclear as contact with Mary throughout the day of her death indicated that there was nothing as regards Mary’s behaviour that caused concern. She was in fact described as perky however at some point after 19:20 on Wednesday 15 January 2014 she changed her clothes and walked some 800m to a nearby railway line where she proceeded to lie down on the track in front of an oncoming service from Portsmouth to Bristol. She died as a result of the multiple injuries she sustained in the collision.","(1) Delay in the decision making process as regards funding the long term therapeutic placement

As early as February 2012 [REDACTED] as indicated in the previous section was supportive of the need for Mary to be placed on a therapeutic placement scheme away from the London Borough of Islington. That view was supported by [REDACTED] from Priory North and I am aware that they wrote to your local authority in November 2012 expressing their concerns due to the lack of progress. Due to the involvement of Islington who were supportive of the proposal from a healthcare perspective Mary’s educational and child social services responsibilities fell to your local authority following the family’s move to Haringey during the summer of 2011. I heard evidence in the form of a report from [REDACTED] who stated that at a Haringey Complex Care Panel Meeting on 9 May 2012 it was agreed that Mary’s case for joint funded placement would be advanced. A letter from the panel subsequently stated that it accepted that Mary’s needs to be given the opportunity to live outside the family home and that a range of options were going to be explored. I was informed by [REDACTED] that this decision was overturned by Children’s Services on the basis it did not meet a threshold for accommodation under Section 20 and that it would not be in Mary’s best interests. I am aware of the involvement of a local MP and the Stroman family’s lawyers who highlighted the local authority’s duty here in terms of context and it was not until March 2013 that funding was authorised by your local authority. Again in [REDACTED] report he makes reference to a further report being commissioned by Haringey Children’s Services in September 2012. The assessment was completed by [REDACTED] and concluded “My experience … may be reflective of the paralysis within the care system around this patient but ultimately of the patient’s own predicament”. Whilst in the terms of Mary’s inquest I did not find a direct causal link between the delay in funding Mary’s placement I am concerned in relation to future cases that could impact on an individual’s mental state and mental health. It is quite clear from the expert opinion evidence that I have read Mary’s educational needs in particular were not being satisfied in either Simmons House or Priory North hence the initial recommendation. The welfare of the child must be paramount and I would ask that you review the practices and procedures that were adopted here resulting in the decision to fund Mary’s long term therapeutic placement with a view to ascertaining as to whether or not lessons could be learned with a view to improving the process and reducing the delay. I fully appreciate that Mary’s case was exceptionally complex but I am concerned that the delay could affect other individuals if placed in a similar situation that may lead to self harming and even death.

(2) The temporary termination of the placement at Tumblewood - August/September 2013

As part of the evidence I was aware that Mary’s placement was temporarily terminated as a result of an OFSTED inspection. Many pupils at Tumblewood including Mary were pupils with a history of disrupted education. One of the reasons Mary was placed at Tumblewood was for this reason given her significant history of time as a voluntary inpatient in hospital and as an inpatient at another establishment both of which were felt by those involved not to address and meet her educational needs sufficiently. I am concerned as part of the process here that given that there was joint funding that the decision to terminate appears to have been taken by your local authority without consultation with the other partner involved - Islington. I am additionally concerned as regards the general decision making process here assessing the safeguarding risk as compared to the benefit of allowing Mary to continue and return to her placement after the holiday period to an environment that provided stability rather than a situation whereby the alternative did not address her educational needs and was unsettling. At the inquest I was satisfied that at the time of her death any issues that arose following her forced absence from Tumblewood were being addressed from the educational perspective which included involving Mary in that decision making process and that there was no direct causal link with her death. My concern is as regards the way your authority handles matters in the future which could potentially unsettle an individual’s mental state possibly resulting in self-harm or even death. Again can I ask you to review the matter with a view to looking to identify any learning points and to communicate them back to me?

Hon. Lord McNally, Chair of the Youth Justice Board; The Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police; Chief Executive GeoAmey","On 2 August 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Stanley (aged 17). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 July 2014.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Peter took his own life by hanging but that there had been a number of missed opportunities to assist him by way of mental health assessment and care over the preceding weeks, most particularly towards the end of his life. However, it could not be said on the balance of probabilities that Peter would have survived if any or all of the opportunities had been taken.","Peter Stanley, aged just 17, was found hanging in woodland on the outskirts of Sheffield on 2 August 2013.

There was a history of concern regarding Peter's mental health, his problems possibly originating from use of a so-called 'legal high'. An assessment by an experienced community mental health nurse (CMHN) at the end of 2012 recognised that Peter could be developing a psychosis and he was offered a care-coordinator. Unfortunately Peter subsequently refused to engage. It was felt better that the service withdrew with an open invitation for Peter to re-engage when he was ready rather than 'harass' him and potentially spoil chances of later engagement.

On 10 April 2013 Peter presented himself to the local authority as 'homeless' because his parents could no longer cope with his behaviour. He was seen by a housing officer and social worker. Peter did not want to be 'looked after' (that is go into the care of the authority) and a bed was found at a suitable establishment ('Roundabout') to provide assessment and help with more immediate issues.

On 3 May Peter saw his own GP complaining of an injury to his back from 'falling downstairs'. Although not disclosed at the time it is clear that Peter suffered this injury when attempting to hang himself on stairs at his mother's address. The significant nature of his injury suggests a violent episode and given his non-disclosure at the time it would be difficult to see this as anything other than a serious attempt on his life.

On 14 July Peter committed a serious and violent episode of damage at Roundabout. He was barred from the premises and thus rendered homeless.

Peter was arrested for the damage and seen in the detention area by a custody nurse, because he had been banging his head on the wall. He denied any history of mental health issues and said he was only banging his head to cause trouble. Because of his behaviour Peter was subject to constant supervision in the police cells. He also required full bodily restraint at one point.

Peter appeared before the Magistrates from custody next day (15 July) and was made subject of a referral order to the Youth Justice Service. The Youth Justice team (YJT) were not made aware of the bizarre behaviour in custody and arrangements were simply made to see him a week later.

Later that morning Peter (now homeless) attended at the local authority Housing Dept with his father, although [REDACTED] was not in the room for much of the interview. A social worker from Children's Services (SWCS) was also present. Housing had little to offer because of the circumstances in which Peter was removed from Roundabout and as there was no supported bed provision available he was declared 'intentionally homeless'. This left Peter to continue with the responsibility of Children's Services.

Peter made a disclosure during this interview about his suicide attempt on the stairs but not whilst his father was present. In fact [REDACTED] never knew of the apparently serious attempt on the stairs whilst Peter was alive.

There were continuing but unsuccessful efforts to find Peter more suitable accommodation than the Bed and Breakfast initially allocated. The SWCS apparently felt that the YJT would be the quickest route to a mental health assessment — but despite discussion about Peter the YJT were not given any information about the mental health history or needs and nothing was put in progress.

Although the Children's Services record system clearly identified the CMHN's previous involvement, he was not contacted at any time before Peter's death

On 31 July a YJT substance misuse worker, saw Peter for a drug screen (not in relation to mental health). Peter told her of many thoughts about suicide, of his attempt on the stairs now four months before and of hearing voices. He said that he felt very low and was so distressed that he wanted to run into oncoming traffic or slice his own leg off. He felt that he had very little support from anyone and feared that he might be schizophrenic.

This was taken seriously and a meaningful risk of self-harm was recognised although not seen as immediate. An appointment to see the YJT mental health worker (who was on leave) was made for a few days hence. The SWCS was contacted but there was little more provided. Further action was left with the YJT pending the mental health assessment the following week. The YJT determined to support Peter pending the assessment -- but were not really equipped to do so. No contact was attempted with Peter's father, nor any attempt to seek a medical view of the situation by telephoning Peter's GP.

The following day (1 August) Peter did not attend a planned course. The YJT telephoned him twice. The first time he was plainly under the influence of drugs/alcohol and said he was unwell. When called later he was incoherent. The YJT became very worried and called the SWCS. Nothing seems to have come from this save that arrangements were made for an out of hours team to telephone Peter each morning over the coming weekend. Peter's whereabouts were unknown as he was not at the B&B.

In fact, Peter was actually with his father that same afternoon. He described Peter as withdrawn, abrupt and intolerant. He plainly didn't see his son as suicidal but then he had no knowledge of either the earlier attempt or of the disclosures to the substance misuse worker. They parted when he took Peter back to the B&B as he felt his behaviour was not acceptable for a planned visit to the family home.

Peter's body was found some hours later. The circumstances were plainly of a deliberate self-hanging.","(1) Peter's mental health problems may have stemmed from the use of a so-called 'legal high'. I understand that some, but not all, mainstream insurers have been persuaded to adopt a policy of not offering cover to establishments that sell such substances. Can this be encouraged further?

(2) When young people are discharged from, or have failed to engage with, Adult Mental Health Services there is no formal 'step-down' policy. The Sheffield Child Death Overview Panel advise me that this should include a referral to a Multi Agency Support Team or Community Youth team who can then establish a key worker and 'team around the child' approach.

(3) On the basis of evidence given by [REDACTED] Assistant Director of Fieldwork Services, Sheffield City Council, it is clear that the custody nurse could have accessed the Children's Services records for Peter on 14 July, even during the night, by calling the Social Services 'out of hours' team. Every local authority has an out of hours system (which would cover adults as well). However I am told that this is not generally known amongst those providing custody medical services.

(4) There is no specific requirement that health professionals completing assessments of young persons in custody suites include a thorough assessment of mental health.

(5) A prisoner escort record (known commonly as a PER) would have been handed over from the police to the privatised court detention officers when Peter was produced before the magistrates. This contains details (inter alia) of risks, self-harm issues, medical attention and warning markers. I understand that the Youth Offending Service believe that the PER should be routinely given to them it would inform assessments as to the immediate needs of the young person. This would only arise, of course, in the relatively few cases where the young person has spent a period in police cells.

(6) Peter was classed as 'intentionally homeless' after his release from court on 15 July. [REDACTED] gave the court compelling evidence that this was wrong and that Peter should have been treated as a 'Child in Need'. Emphasis on the 'Child in Need' process when a young person was homeless would ensure proper assessment and sharing of information. Failures in sharing Peter's mental health history/needs were significant issues in this case. This emphasis is now standard practice in Sheffield but I understand it is not likely to be the case everywhere.

(7) This case shows the need for a greater number of places in supported accommodation.

(8) The Sheffield Child Death Overview Panel have also recommended that no young person should be deemed intentionally homeless.

(9) It is evident that front line social services practitioners are not always aware of when and where to make mental health referrals.

(10) It is understood that the number of Youth Offending Service staff who have access to, and training for, the Social Services records system is limited.

(11) There is no system to ensure that where there has been previous psychiatric services involvement by a young person that such information will be used to inform assessment and the 'Child in Need' planning process.

(12) There is no system to ensure that when a young person has presented with previous suicidal ideology that advice is taken from health professionals regarding the potential risks.

(13) There is no system to ensure that 16 and 17 year olds placed in supported accommodation have needs-based access to support services, including mental health and substance misuse, irrespective of whether they fall within s.20 of the Children's Act.","""Peter Stanley (aged 17)""; ""the conclusion of the inquest was that Peter took his own life by hanging""; ""Peter Stanley, aged just 17, was found hanging""; ""the circumstances were plainly of a deliberate self-hanging""",True,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 June 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was that she died as a consequence of her own actions though her intention is not clear beyond unreasonable doubt. The cause of death was 1a. Hanging.","Helena suffered from bulimia and had been assaulted sexually whilst on a school exchange visit. This occurred during 2011 and the incident probably occurred in France. During October 2012 to January 2013 a number of events occurred including that she revealed the fact she was bulimic and the fact she had been assaulted, she took an overdose, self-harmed at a party, and wrote a number of letters which when read after her death appeared to have been suicide letters. Although she was referred by the School Nurse to Child and Adult Mental Health Services (CAMHS) she was not seen until the day before she died and no-one who saw her thought that she was suicidal and everyone who had dealings with her seems to have misunderstood her true feelings and intentions.","(1) As for CAMHS (part of the Foundation Trust) the referral system was not working adequately and the referral was not followed up after triage even though it was classified as urgent.

(2) Staffing levels at CAMHS were inadequate in terms of pure numbers and also in terms of experience and training in connection with teenagers.

(3) Those dealing with Helena failed to recognise the escalation of the incidents in which she was involved in terms of their seriousness and their increasing frequency.

(4) As far as Cumbria County Council is concerned, they are involved because I understand they are responsible for provision of the school nurse service although they contract this out to the Partnership Trust but nonetheless the responsibility lies with Cumbria County Council. I thought that the expectations of the school nurse in this particular case were totally unrealistic. I heard in evidence that she was responsible for 5 senior schools and 20 or more feeder schools to those 5 senior schools and although the total number of pupils involved was not clear, it is obviously thousands rather than hundreds. She worked a 26 hour week, had 40 current cases at Kirkbie Kendal School alone. The provision of service at this level is totally unfair on the school nurse concerned, unrealistic in the sense that others have expectations of a school nurse which one part time provider cannot meet.

(5) The school’s counsellor had been in post for many years and there was no proof of her qualifications or her competence nor of update and training or registration with any professional body.

Hewitt,Greater Manchester West,The Secretary of State for Justice; The Youth Justice Board; The National Offenders Management Service; HM YOI Hindley,"On the 31st January 2012 an investigation was commenced into the death of Jake Reginald Hardy, aged 17 years.

The inquest was heard between the 24th February and the 4th April 2014.

The inquest jury concluded that :

1. On the 20th January 2012 Jake Hardy was found partially suspended in his cell at HM Young Offender Institute Hindley. The medical cause of his death was Ia Hypoxic / Ischaemic Brain Injury, due to Ib Cardiac Arrest, due to Ic Hanging.

2. He died as a result of his own deliberate act but the evidence did not establish, beyond reasonable doubt, whether he intended that act to cause his death.

3. His death was caused or more than minimally contributed to by failures by the State to protect his life, namely :

(i) a failure to provide him with adequate personal officer support and monitoring;

(ii) a failure adequately to record and consider reports of previous self-harm and thoughts of self-harm and suicide;

(iii) a failure adequately to refer to the Safeguarding Department observed and reported verbal abuse;

(iv) a failure to record on C-Nomis and in the wing observation book observed and reported verbal abuse;

(v) a failure from the 29th December 2011 onwards to investigate reports that he was being verbally abused by other young persons and to take action to address such abuse;

(vi) a failure on the 18th January 2012 onwards to provide, update and utilise under the ACCT process an adequate care map in respect of his risk of self-harm;

(vii) a failure from the 18th January 2012 onwards to move him from cell F1/24 to a different location;

(viii) a failure on the evening of the 20th January 2012 to permit him to use the telephone;

(ix) a failure on the evening of the 20th January 2012 to supervise association properly and to protect him from the negative behaviour of other young persons towards him;

(x) a failure on the evening of the 20th January 2012 to review the level of his risk of self-harm;

(xi) a failure on the evening of the 20th January 2012 to review the regularity with which he was checked; and

(xii) a failure on the evening of the 20th January 2012 to review the suitability of his location for his safety overnight.","Jake Hardy was a 17 year-old young man from Chesterfield, Derbyshire who was sentenced to a detention and training order and sent to HM YOI Hindley, Wigan in December 2011. He was a young person with a number of vulnerabilities. He had been diagnosed as having learning and behavioural difficulties, had been issued with a Statement of Special Educational Needs and had attended a “special needs school”. He had a low reading age and was emotionally immature. He also had a history of being bullied by his peers at school and some history of self-harming behaviour and suicidal ideation. He relied heavily on his family, especially his mother, for emotional support.

As the jury’s findings show, several of the policies and procedures then in place within the HM YOI Hindley designed to identify, monitor and protect vulnerable detainees and those at risk of self-harm were not utilised either as fully as they should have been or at all in relation to Jake. Further, there were failures by prison and clinical staff both to consider and to record relevant information in Jake’s records.

Over the seven weeks that Jake was in HM YOI Hindley he told staff on a number of occasions that he was being verbally bullied by other detainees but no referral was made to the Safeguarding Department until shortly before his death. Further, a written report made in late December 2011 by Jake’s Youth Offending Service worker, linking the verbal abuse to Jake’s risk of self-harm and suicide, did not result in effective protective steps being taken.

After evening lock-up on 17 January 2012, Jake smashed the television in his cell and used the broken glass to self-harm. He was placed on an “Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork” (“ACCT”) process but the jury found that, when it was reviewed, there was a failure to create an adequate “care map” in respect of his risk of further self-harm.

When questioned about the incident, Jake stated that he was being verbally bullied and that detainees in other cells were shouting out obscenities about his family. Subsequently, perpetrators of the verbal abuse were identified but no action was taken to re-locate either them or Jake, in part because Jake resisted this. Jake’s mood and presentation between 17 and 20 January was variable but concern for his mental health and his safety were raised when he was disciplined for breaking his television.

On 20 January 2012 Jake appeared to be calm and cheerful during the day but he became angry and upset when the prison staff supervising evening association forgot to unlock his cell as he had wanted to telephone his mother, to whom he had not spoken for several days, before the other detainees were released from their cells. He was told by the staff that he could use the telephone later, although this was not in fact permitted because of his subsequent behaviour.

During the association period Jake remained in his cell and a number of detainees congregated outside his door. The evidence revealed that some of those detainees behaved in a harassing manner towards Jake, opening and closing his observation flap, hitting his door and calling and gesturing to him. Supervising staff did not take any or sufficient steps to prevent or stop this. Jake was again angry and upset and he repeatedly tried to cover his observation panel with paper and he was kicking his door for over an hour. Further, shortly after evening association was finished, Jake was found to have broken the furniture in his cell.

Despite Jake’s presentation and behaviour, the prison staff failed prior to final lock-up to review under the ACCT procedure the level of Jake’s risk of self-harm, the regularity with which he was to be checked overnight and the suitability of his location for his safety overnight. Jake was found by night staff less than an hour later, on a routine check, to be partially suspended by a ligature tied to a window bar.","A. To (i) the Secretary of State for Justice
(ii) the Youth Justice Board

1. It was apparent from the evidence I heard that a significant proportion of the children and young persons placed in HM YOI Hindley are vulnerable and have complex needs. This may well be true of the children and young persons placed in other Youth Offender Institutions also.

Clearly, the nature and extent of Jake Hardy’s vulnerabilities were not unusual amongst this population, with many detainees having some form of learning difficulty. I was told that other detainees are vulnerable for different reasons, for example because they have been abused or neglected or their upbringing has been adversely affected by a parent’s misuse of alcohol or drugs. Many are “looked after children”. I was also told that these detainees’ “complexities affect their reaction to authority and boundaries and are probably the reason they ended up in custody in the first place”.

It was also apparent that vulnerable detainees are likely to lack the emotional and intellectual maturity and resilience they may need to cope with the pressures of life in custody (such as separation from family and bullying) and that the risk of self-harm and suicide can increase in consequence. I was told that safeguarding these detainees is made more difficult by the prevalence of their volatile and unpredictable behaviour.

Overall, the evidence suggested that the placement of vulnerable children and young persons with complex needs in the environment of a Youth Offender Institute (particularly if some distance from home) does, in some cases, result in an increased risk of self-harm and suicide which it is often difficult for prison and clinical staff to manage effectively, even with the benefit of the various policies and procedures which are in place.

2. As stated above, significant changes of policy and procedure have been introduced at HM YOI Hindley in order to address concerns raised about the identification, monitoring and protection of vulnerable children and young persons and those at risk of self-harm and suicide. It may well be that some or all of those changes would provide better protection to detainees in other Young Offender Institutes but I am not aware that consideration has been given to the adoption of these changes elsewhere in the estate.

B. To (i) the Secretary of State for Justice
(ii) the Youth Justice Board
(iii) the National Offenders Management Service
(iv) HM YOI Hindley

1. A number of the prison staff from HM YOI Hindley who gave evidence at the inquest clearly lacked (a) any or sufficient aptitude or temperamental suitability for the demands of working with vulnerable young persons with complex needs and/or (b) any or sufficient understanding of those needs and their causes (such as the nature and effect of specific learning difficulties and the effect of abuse or neglect in childhood).

I have been told that these matters are now addressed to some extent by the Youth Justice Board and HM YOI Hindley but that further changes are being considered to the way in which prison staff working in Young Offender Institutes are recruited, screened for aptitude and trained. I report this concern so that any outstanding further steps can be considered.

2. The evidence revealed an almost complete failure to provide Jake Hardy with the benefit and protection of a Personal Officer, despite a comprehensive scheme being in place. Currently the scheme is of pivotal importance for the identification and monitoring of vulnerability and risk.

There remains a concern about whether all officers at HM YOI Hindley have a sufficient understanding of this role and its importance and about the absence of any system to alert managers to any failure by a Personal Officer to meet his obligations under this scheme or to audit his performance. This concern may be of relevance to other Young Offender Institutes also.

3. Cells containing ligature points (such as window bars) are still in use at HM YOI Hindley for detainees who have been assessed to be at risk of self-harm or suicide. This concern may be of relevance to other Young Offender Institutes also.

4. Verbal bullying by means of detainees “shouting out” at night is a common problem in HM YOI Hindley and can increase the risk of self-harm and suicide by those targeted, especially overnight. The fabric, layout and design of the cells in HM YOI Hindley does not remedy this problem. Further, it is difficult for the night orderly officer on duty on a wing, who is there alone, to tackle the problem effectively. There is no effective system in place to ensure that the problem is routinely monitored and tackled effectively, whether by means of additional staff or otherwise. This concern may be of relevance to other Young Offender Institutes also.

5. The children and young persons detained at HM YOI Hindley are provided with a weekly credit which they may use to telephone family or other approved numbers. Calls are made from a communal telephone located in the association area of a wing. Prison staff have a discretion to permit further calls to be made from an office telephone for good reason.

I was told that in-cell telephony has been introduced in newly built parts of the children and young persons’ estate but it is not available in HM YOI Hindley and other Young Offender Institutes. Currently, therefore, these detainees are not able to speak privately on the telephone and there is no sufficient system in place to ensure that a child or young person in crisis or in need of emotional support (whether by reason of being bullied or experiencing feelings of self-harm or suicide) can speak to a family member without significant delay.

6. The shift patterns of Senior Officers working on the wings within HM YOI Hindley are such that they do not always overlap and handover is often by means of written entries in a “handover book”. The handover book I saw contained short notes addressing random matters and there was apparently no routine recording of a more comprehensive review of the shift. There is no system in place to ensure that important information and outstanding tasks are sufficiently recorded by one Senior Officer at the end of his shift and then read by the next Senior Officer at the start of his shift.

It was clear from the evidence that it is the Senior Officer’s responsibility to have an overview of what is happening on the wing and matters of relevance to the safeguarding of detainees housed there. Therefore, the passing of key information and outstanding tasks between Senior Officers on a wing is of real importance to the safety of detainees. This concern may be of relevance to other Young Offender Institutes also.","""Jake Reginald Hardy, aged 17 years""; ""partially suspended in his cell""; ""medical cause of his death was...

Hashmi,Greater Manchester North,"Affinity Healthcare Ltd (The Priory Hospital, Cheadle Royal); Manchester Mental Health & Social Care Trust; Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust; Department of Health; Faculty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Royal College of Psychiatrists","On 8 January 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Miss Samiyo Sahra Shiih Farah then aged 17 years of 1 Outringham Drive, Openshaw, Manchester. The investigation was concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 April 2014.","Briefly and by way of background, the deceased was a highly articulate and intelligent young woman who had moved to the UK with her family in around 2004.

She had a history of self-harm since the age of 14.

On the 30 October 2012, Miss Farah consulted her GP who diagnosed depression. On the 31 October 2012, she was admitted to the A & E department having taken an overdose of paracetamol. She was subsequently transferred to an adult MAU under the care of Registered General Nurses for medical treatment of the overdose.

Miss Farah was seen on admission by the nurse-led Mental Health Liaison team (MHL). This was said to have been the process in place within the trust at the material time. The deceased was not therefore referred directly to a Consultant Psychiatrist for assessment.

The MHL nurse appraised MAU staff regarding Miss Farah’s presenting condition and advised that if they had any concerns regarding her mental health, then further contact could be made (with the MHL team).

The MHL nurse did not see the deceased again until discharge on the 8 November, although she participated in a multi strategy meeting in the interim.

Anti-depressant therapy was not instigated (this would necessarily have required the involvement of a member of the medical psychiatric team) - on the basis that medication was only one of a variety of types of treatment.

During the course of her admission, the deceased made allegations against family members which triggered a safeguarding investigation. This necessitated the involvement of the multi-disciplinary team. The allegations made were unsubstantiated and the deceased was discharged home with a plan of care in the community (Child & Adolescent Mental Health Team - ‘CAMHS’ - and intensive home treatment team). A children’s social worker was involved in the discharge planning process, however it was unclear what/how many different discharge options were made available to the deceased at this time.

Whilst on the face of it Miss Farah appeared more settled following discharge, her family felt that she continued to demonstrate uncharacteristic behaviour.

On the 26 November 2012, the deceased’s mother discovered that her daughter had purchased a large number of paracetamol and cocodamol tablets. She called for an emergency ambulance. Miss Farah was described as appearing ‘happy’ at the prospect of readmission.

Miss Farah was seen by doctors at the same A & E department whereupon she was referred to a Psychiatrist for assessment. Whilst the decision to refer directly to a physician was no doubt wholly appropriate, it was ‘at odds’ with the previously identified referral process (MHL) - particularly bearing in mind the circumstances surrounding admission on each occasion.

Nonetheless, the deceased was diagnosed as suffering from marked depression with suicidal ideation. Arrangements were therefore made for her to be admitted directly to an adolescent mental health unit on the 27 November. The only bed available at the time was in the private sector. This bed was commissioned with the proviso that as soon as an NHS bed became available, the deceased would be repatriated. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health team (‘CAMHS’) became involved and a lead practitioner was identified.

Following admission, the deceased was placed on 1:5 observations. A STAR Risk Assessment was initiated following admission and completed subsequently. A key nurse was allocated but she went on leave very soon after the deceased’s arrival. There was conflicting evidence regarding whether associate nurses were used/allocated and at what grade (the associate acting in the absence of the key nurse).

Between the 13 and 15 December 2012 Miss Farah self-harmed by ligature (shoelaces) twice and was found head-banging against a wall. She remained on 1:5 observations. The STAR risk assessment tool was not updated at the time, nor was it updated prior to repatriation.

A bed became available at the NHS hospital sometime after the 17 December. Miss Farah was unhappy to transfer to another unit as she had started to form therapeutic relationships with staff and felt safe where she was, on 1:5 observations. She made her views known to those caring for her.

On or around the 18 December, the Dr in charge of Miss Farah’s care formed the view that it was clinically preferable for her to remain. He allocated the task of contacting the Commissioners to the staff nurse on the ward round. This, it was subsequently conceded, was inappropriate and that contact with the Commissioners should have been tasked to a senior manager or have been the responsibility of the clinician himself. The ward round ended late, by which time the funding office (who held the contact details for the Commissioners) had closed. The staff nurse maintained that as he was unable to contact the Commissioners, he rang the NHS unit directly in order to put forward both the patient’s view and the clinical preference of the Dr - only to be told that the transfer was to go ahead the next day.

Communication between CAMHS, the private hospital and NHS provider was limited to say the least. The CAMHS lead was not advised of Miss Farah’s wish to stay at the private unit, the date of her transfer or the self-harm incidents of the 13 to 15 December. Had he been made aware of her views and the clinical preference of the Consultant, then he would have ‘escalated’ matters to his manager.

Miss Farah was transferred to NHS care on the 19 December. En route, the escorting Health Care Assistant (HCA) purchased shoelaces for the deceased from the shop next to the NHS unit with, he maintained, the full agreement and knowledge of the discharging staff nurse. This was so as to ensure the patient’s dignity.

The escorting HCA maintained that he handed over the transfer documentation and gave a brief verbal handover to a nurse on the accepting unit. This handover included bringing the recent purchase of shoelaces to their attention.

The staff at the NHS unit maintained that they were not advised of the ligature/self-harm incidents of the 13-15 December and that had they been told, they would i) have questioned the appropriateness of the deceased’s transfer and ii) had the transfer been agreed, that this information would have materially altered their plan of care for the deceased.

A STAR risk assessment was completed by the Occupational Therapist following admission. The deceased was later seen by the junior Dr and placed on 1:15 observations following discussion with the Consultant.

It was subsequently conceded that a call ought to have been made to the transferring unit to enquire as to why the deceased had been on 1:5 observations for 22 days prior to transfer as this was unusual.

Initially, Miss Farah was placed on the ‘acute corridor’ (three young people were in residency at the time, with two staff). After a short period, she was transferred to the main ward area.

On the 23 December 2012, a search was conducted of Miss Farah’s room, along with the rooms of two of her peers. The deceased had allegedly been passing ‘contraband’ to others within the unit. Items found within the deceased’s room included strips of material (taken from an item of her clothing), two pairs of shoelaces (one set hidden under a bed pillow), broken CDs and a plastic bag was found hidden upon her person (the deceased had previously researched the use of ‘exit bags’ as a way of self-harming). The contraband items were confiscated. The deceased was allowed to keep her clothing and was kept on 1:15 observations. The STAR risk assessment was not updated until the 28 December. Key staff/managers were however notified via the ‘Datix’ system, save for the Consultant responsible for Miss Farah’s care (he was a locum at the time and was not included within this notification process). He was told of the incident the following day and observed Miss Farah on the ward (no direct patient contact). The patient observation rate remained 1:15.

On the 30 December 2012, a unit search was directed by senior managers. At 09:30 a nurse entered Miss Farah’s room but could not wake her. He called for a female member of staff to assist before approaching the deceased. Miss Farah was found unresponsive in her bed with a (non-suspension) ligature around her neck. The ligature had been constructed from shreds of fabric from her clothing. CPR was commenced and paramedics summoned. Life was confirmed extinct at 10:02 on the 30 December.

During a search of the deceased’s room by police after her death, a serrated drink can was discovered hidden in the deceased’s bag. The SIO believed that this item may have been used to create the shreds of clothing used to form the ligature.","1) Observation protocol - there is no national guidance/policy on the observation of children and adolescents within specialist mental health units. At present, clinicians are forced to adopt/adapt policies applied to adults with mental health issues. The care needs of young people are quite different to those of adults.

2) Communication/contact between transferring establishments - there is no formal policy/protocol in use between the private sector and the NHS detailing steps that should be taken (and by whom) upon transfer of patients between sectors, thus risking that not all key information (both verbal and written) is properly communicated before, during and after transfer. Whilst progress is being made in this regard at local level following the death of Miss Farah (and may well be the basis upon which any national policy/protocol might be formulated) there is currently no communication/transfer protocol in existence. This also potentially impacts upon all other healthcare sector providers e.g. the acute sector, hospital to care home, acute to rehabilitation/community services etc.

3) There appears to have been an inconsistency of approach following Miss Farah’s admissions to A & E. She was referred directly to a Psychiatrist on the second attendance when she was clearly unwell but had not managed to self-harm but was not on the first attendance when she had taken an overdose.

Hassell,London Inner North,"The Right Honourable Jeremy Hunt MP, Secretary of State for Health; Department of Health","On 18 October 2012, one of the assistant coroners for Inner North London commenced an investigation into the death of Tallulah Wilson, a fifteen year old schoolgirl.

I concluded the investigation at the end of the inquest on 22 January 2014. The jury made a narrative determination, finding that Tallulah jumped in front of a train, taking her own life.","The jury found that, as a result of Tallulah’s dissatisfaction with her friendship group, she created an online persona.

She posted about self harm and suicide. She included photographs that she said were of herself following cutting.

Her consultant psychiatrist gave evidence that, with hindsight, it seems that when her Tumblr account was deleted (following her mother’s discovery of the damaging nature of her posts), Tallulah may have felt herself to be in some way deleted. Thousands of people had read her posts and she had gained great satisfaction from that. So on the one hand, her internet use may have had a negative impact; and yet on the other hand, preventing her internet use may have had a negative impact.","Although Tallulah was treated by a number of healthcare professionals, and her mother was extremely concerned about her wellbeing, no person who gave evidence felt that, at the time they were looking after Tallulah, they had a good enough understanding of the evolving way that the internet is used by young people, most particularly in terms of the online life that is quite separate from, but sometimes seems to be used to try to validate, the rest of life.

Research; the development of improved clinical practice at a national level, details of which are then disseminated by national training; and risk assessment refinement, all seem to be key.

Digital lives basic training and audit is already available, but is not part of standard induction training to raise awareness for all in psychiatric and psychological fields, let alone for all doctors.

I heard at inquest that the Department of Health has taken the lead nationally on youth suicide prevention, commissioning research exploring the use of the internet and trying to understand the role of social media in youth suicides.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 May 2014.
The conclusion of the inquest was suicide contributed to by a failure to protect from a known risk of suicide, the medical cause of death being hanging.","Dana Louise Baker was a looked after child under the care of Worcestershire County Council. It was known that a breakdown of her foster placement would lead to extreme distress with a consequent risk that she might kill herself.

When the placement did breakdown Dana was allowed to stay with an adult friend and the following day she hanged herself in a public place.","(1) As outlined in the IMRs, the Serious Case Review and the draft Overview Report there was a lack of knowledge and understanding as between various agencies involved with Dana and inadequate communication between them.
