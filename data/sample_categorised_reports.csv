Calderdale Council 1,"On 19 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacob Lee Shorter, 19 years old. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 June 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a multiple injuries including complete disruption of the torso and skull fracture. .","Jacob was in long term foster care. Following his 18th birthday he was under the pathways leaving care team. He was subject to an education, health and care plan and was still receiving support from William Henry Smith School and received therapy sessions from them. He was seen by a pathways advisor and had an independent visitor in place. In May and June 2023 professionals meetings concerns were expressed about his low mood and he was encouraged to attend his GP with his foster carer. The GP report confirms there was no low moods or anxiety reports apart from the 24 November 2023 appointment that he attended with his foster carer where treatment was discussed and he wanted to think about his options. His foster carer contacted the local authority in September 2023 after he had told her his feelings had gone downhill and she was not given any strategies to help him. The independent visitor discussed his wellbeing with him on 3 December 2023 where he said he had felt suicidal in the past but did not currently feel this way. This information was not passed on to his foster carer or to the pathways team. He was seen again on 31 December 2023 where he was reported to be doing well and no concerns were raised about his emotional wellbeing. On new years day Jacob left home and mentioned about having choices to his foster carer. He did not say where he was going and did not return home. On 1 January 2024 Jacob made his way onto the train tracks at Heeley Loop in Sheffield. He was seen on the track in the four foot area. [REDACTED] It was dark and raining heavily that evening. The train driver applied the emergency brake. Jacob made no attempt to move. There was no time to sound the horn. Unfortunately the train was unable to stop in time and impacted with Jacob causing fatal injuries. Investigations were undertaken that could not establish how Jacob had accessed the train lines. In that area I heard there is more than standard security, with fences and walls. There is pedestrian access and vehicle access gates, but these were locked and everything was in order.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Whilst the Independent Visitor was made aware of previous suicidal ideation this was not passed on to the foster carer or anyone else. Calderdale were unable to tell me of the training they receive or the escalation route for concerns or disclosures of this type. There is a clear risk that if this type of information is not passed on and adequate training is not provided in terms of metal health then this could cause future deaths. 6,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,The circumstances of the death are as follows : Eifion Wyn Huws was aged 63 at the time of his death on 10 June 2022. He had a past medical history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having had the diagnosis on 12 January 2022 and poorer mental health as a result. Other than the lymphoma he had no other significant past medical history. The anticipation of awaiting scans and treatment impacted severely upon his mental health but he had significant family support. Eifion was regularly reviewed by a GP and medicated accordingly. He had previous attempts at self-harm by way of medication overdose or self-inflicted injury. He had been under the care of the Community Mental Health Team including Home Treatment Team and primary care since early 2022 up to his death. His acts of self-harm were impulsive but serious. On 10 June 2022 Eifion had left his home address to attend his daughter's home across the road to let the cat out. There was a concern for Eifion when he did not reply to a text message from his wife around 15 mins later who then attended at their daughter's home and on opening the front door found Eifion suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion's GP had made a 'very urgent' referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation (SPOAA) on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this 'very urgent' referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients. b. During the evidence it was accepted that 'a' above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board's investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement. 2. An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion's death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner.

The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not been heard.,"Mary Jones was found dead at her home address on 7 November 2023. She had last been spoken to on 6 November. She died as a result of a deliberate overdose of medication, taken with the intent to end her own life. As part of calculating what a fatal dose would be, she consulted a well known book advising on suicide methods.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The “well known suicide book” I refer to in Box 3 is ” (redact on publication). As part of my investigations, I have received evidence that this book is readily available on Amazon.co.uk following a simple search for the same. Furthermore, it is available on Amazon Prime – so is available for expedited delivery. It is the first item shown when a search is made. Amazon, or the algorithms, are clearly aware of the potential for harm that this book can cause as there is a banner at the top giving contact numbers for the Samaritans. Despite this, the book is still on sale. I am aware that the Area Coroner for Cheshire wrote to Amazon in December 2023 raising this same issue, but has not yet had a response. I am concerned that the ready availability of this book will lead to people being more effective in any attempts to take their own lives. 6",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

The Chief Executive of NHS Dorset 1,"On the 4 th April 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Emma Victoria Sanders, aged 34 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 18 th November 2024. The medical cause of death was: Ia Hypoxic Brain Encephalopathy Ib Asphyxia The conclusion of the Inquest was a narrative conclusion that Emma Victoria Sanders died as a consequence of the self-application of a ligature to her neck, in circumstances where her intention remains unclear.","Emma had a complex mental health history with confirmed diagnoses of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and was known to regularly self harm by a variety of means. Emma had a history of opiate dependence and on the 22nd February 2023, she began a period in a detoxification and rehabilitation placement in Cornwall in order to become abstinent from methadone so she could progress to therapy treatment for her mental health diagnoses. Prior to this she had experienced a period of relative stability with her mental health. During this placement the methadone prescription was reduced more quickly than she had experienced before, and she became emotionally dysregulated. Her mental health deteriorated, and her acts of self harm increased as a result of which she was taken to the local hospital in Cornwall. The placement was ended on the 7th March as it was felt her risks were too high to be managed in that setting. On the 14th March 2023 Emma was taken to the Emergency Department at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth after she disclosed that she had taken an overdose of her prescribed medication. At this time the hospital was experiencing extreme capacity pressures and Emma was placed in the cohorting corridor which was being staffed by paramedics due to the capacity pressures. At 18.58 hours, when for a very short period of time there were no staff in the corridor, Emma can be seen on the CCTV of the corridor to secret upon her person a nasal canula with plastic tubing from an equipment trolley. At 19.53 hours Emma went to the toilet in the Emergency Department. At 20.03 hours, Emma was found in a collapsed and unresponsive condition on the floor of the toilet with a ligature fashioned from nasal canula tubing around her neck. Following attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation there was a return of spontaneous circulation, and she was admitted to the critical care unit at the hospital where she continued to receive care, however her condition deteriorated, and she died on the 19th March 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. At the time of her death Emma had a Frequent Attender Care plan, or as they are now known a High Intensity Use Care Plan, in place. This plan was agreed by representatives from Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (DHUFT) who provide the mental health care across Dorset, a representative from the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, a representative from Poole Hospital and a representative from We Are With You (WAWY) who supported Emma with her substance misuse. The aims of this plan for Emma were: • to provide a consistent approach when Emma presented to the emergency department • to streamline her care so that she does not have to wait any longer than necessary in the ED as she has identified this makes her feel worse • to minimise the impact on emergency department resources when Emma attends • to reduce the use of restrictive interventions which may exacerbate Emma's distress ii. South West Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWAST), who provide the paramedic care in the South West, were not provided with the plan prior to the 14th March 2023, nor were other hospitals Emma may present to, such as the other local hospital in Dorset, Dorset County Hospital, or the hospital in 3 Cornwall where Emma was taken to when she self harmed on the 5th March 2023 during her time at the detoxification and rehabilitation placement. iii. On the 14th March 2023, due to the capacity issues the cohorting area was opened at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital and representatives from SWAST were caring for the patients in the cohorting area. When Emma arrived at the hospital, she was taken to the cohorting area and was booked into the hospital by the triage nurse from the hospital, although was not seen by them and her previous records were not accessed. iv. There can be a delay in accessing the hospital patient record when a patient arrives at the hospital as following the booking in process, there needs to be a merger of the ambulance paperwork to verify they have the correct person before the hospital patient record can be accessed. The process adopted by different hospitals may cause a delay in access to the hospital patient record and evidence was given that at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital this could be anything up to 10 minutes from experience. v. When Emma arrived at the hospital she was booked in by the triage nurse between 18.49 and 18.52 hours, however the merger of her records did not happen until 18.59 hours. No representative from the hospital saw Emma prior to her death and she was monitored by the SWAST paramedics in the cohorting area, so there was no access to her patient record which detailed her significant history of self harm and the Frequent Attender Care Plan. The Frequent Attender Care Plan was not followed throughout the 1 hour and 47 minutes Emma was with professionals from when SWAST attended her home address until the time she was last seen prior to her death. Had it been accessed, and followed, there would have been opportunities to discuss with Emma further support for her whilst she was at the hospital and the evidence given by the witnesses who had contact with her that day was that they would have considered managing her care differently. vi. University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust, of which the Royal Bournemouth Hospital forms part, have taken action internally to ensure that a person's records are now available when a person arrives at the hospital and this would include access to Frequent Attender Care Plans, however evidence was given that a similar process around the merger of records is undertaken at other hospitals across the South West, from the experience of SWAST, and this may also be a national issue. vii. The Summary Care Record (SCR) is accessible to a variety of healthcare professionals and accessible to SWAST. 4 viii. As per the NHS England website, link found here Summary Care Record - NHS England Digital, “The Summary Care Record (SCR) is a national database that holds electronic records of important patient information such as current medication, allergies and details of any previous bad reactions to medicines, created from GP medical records. It can be seen and used by authorised staff in other areas of the health and care system involved in the patient's direct care”. ix. Documents cannot be uploaded to the SCR, however a section can be added to the SCR to detail information such as care plans. Evidence was given that the content of the SCR is controlled by the specific Integrated Care Boards (ICB) covering that area. There are 42 ICBs across England and Wales. x. The SCR for Dorset does not include a section to detail the care plans in place for individuals. The Deputy Director for Care for SWAST gave evidence that none of the ICBs in the South West Region has a section in the SCR to detail care plans in place for individuals. IF there were such a section, the GP of the individual would then be responsible for uploading the details to the SCR and then it would be accessible to other health professionals the person comes into contact with nationally. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. There can be a delay in accessing a patient's hospital record and history when they are taken to hospital by a paramedic depending on the method of booking in and triage which could impact on patient care, especially if there are delays in them being assessed such as when they are placed in cohorting areas, and this could lead to a future death. ii. The Summary Care Record does not detail care plans in place for individuals in Dorset, the wider South West region and may be nationally. Lack of access to these plans could impact on patient care and lead to a future death. 6",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 23 July 2024. The conclusion was that Danny Anderson died as a result of suicide, contributed to by neglect.","Danny Anderson suffered from chronic mental health difficulties, which first developed around the age of 15. His past psychiatric history included serious incidents of self-harm and necessary admissions to hospital under the provisions of the Mental Health Act. In 2022, Danny required a six-week admission to hospital in February/March 2022, due to paranoid and delusional beliefs. In June 2022, Danny again required admission under the Mental Health Act for paranoid and delusional beliefs. He received care and assessment in hospital under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. He received a number of possible diagnoses during the course of the admission. Evidence is accepted from an independent psychiatric expert, that Danny was likely to have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in 2022. This is based upon his presenting condition, requiring the admissions to hospital, and based upon his presentation throughout the six-month period in hospital – June to December 2022. Danny's condition was not correctly diagnosed before discharge from hospital. Danny was entitled to Section 117 after-care but no significant attention was given to his Section 117 after-care needs. Danny should have been assessed for supported accommodation. This was not done and supported accommodation was not sought for him. Danny was discharged to grossly inadequate hotel accommodation. Danny was discharged from hospital on the 14 December 2022. There was no comprehensive assessment of risk prior to discharge. There was no comprehensive safety plan put into place for him. Danny had stated his intention to stop his anti-psychotic medication before he was discharged from hospital, but no plan was put in place to address the clear risks of non-compliance with medication. The community mental health team did not communicate to the housing team, the importance of Danny being placed within the area of the community mental health team. Danny was placed out of area and was not seen face to face by his care co-ordinator before his discharge from the community team. Telephone contacts between Danny and his care co-ordinator raised significant concerns about Danny's mental health and living circumstances. Despite this, he was discharged from the community mental health team following telephone contact on the 18 January 2023. No communication was sent to Danny's GP to inform them of the discharge from mental health services. On the 30 March 2023, Danny was found hanging inside his room at [REDACTED] . Paramedics attended and pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. Danny took his own life, whilst suffering from a mental illness, and whilst receiving absolutely no care from the mental health services. Danny's death was contributed to by cumulative failures, amounting to a gross failure, to provide mental health care to him","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: There was no evidence of any adequate formulation of risk prior to Danny's discharge from hospital on the 14 December 2022 and no evidence of any adequate risk formulation prior to Danny's discharge from the community mental health team in January 2023. The statement “Danny does not present with any suicidal ideation or self-harming behaviour“ was copied and pasted multiple times throughout the risk assessment template on the 14 December 2022. There was no analysis or formulation of risk for 3 Danny. From review of the records throughout the admission, I am concerned that there was an over-reliance upon Danny's answer to questions posed about suicidal ideation and intent. At the point of discharge, there was no evidence of information gathering around Danny's mental state, behaviour, psychiatric history, history of abuse, social situation – and evidence that this information was used to form a judgment about the likelihood or probability of an adverse or harmful outcome (in accordance with the Trust's risk policy). There was no evidence of any consideration of Danny's historical factors and experiences, more recent problems and existing strengths and resources (in accordance with the NICE guidelines 2022). Witnesses from consultant level to care co-ordinator level, were unable to describe a robust risk assessment process. I am concerned that staff do not fully understand how to assess and manage risk. There was no safety plan on discharge from hospital, or prior to discharge from the community team, to address the clear risks that Danny posed. 6",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

NHS England, Prison Healthcare Commissioners for HMP Lowdham Grange ('NHSE') 3. , Managing Director for Justice and Immigration Services, Serco 4. , Justice Director, Sodexo 5. , Chief Executive, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 1","On 5 April 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Anthony Binfield, David William Richards and Rolandas Karbauskas. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, heard before a jury, calling evidence on dates between 4 November 2024 and 7 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Anthony, David and Rolandas had all died as a result of self-inflicted ligature asphyxiation, while in state detention at HMP Lowdham Grange, within a 19-day period of one another. The jury found multiple failings and missed opportunities in their care had probably more than minimally contributed to their deaths.","Serco had operated HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire, for 25 years under the provisions of a Private Finance Initiative ('PFI'). When the PFI expired on 15 February 2023, the Ministry of Justice awarded the prison operator contract to Sodexo. This was the first private provider to private provider prison transfer to take place in England and Wales. To facilitate the contract exit and transfer, Serco, Sodexo and HMPPS each established their own mobilisation and transfer team to oversee the project between August 2022 and February 2023. Sodexo assumed operational control of the prison on 16 February 2023. On 6 March 2023, Anthony Binfield was declared deceased inside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was the result of suicide. On 13 March 2023, David William Richards was declared deceased outside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was accidental. On 25 March 2023, Rolandas Karbauskas was declared deceased outside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was the result of suicide. All three men had vulnerabilities and had been in contact with prison and healthcare staff concerning these vulnerabilities in the period shortly before their deaths. There were multiple missed opportunities to have considered the risk pertinent information held within various systems and records when engaging with all three men. The jury found that there were shortcomings in the culture and systems with regards to prison and healthcare services, which contributed to the three self-inflicted deaths. Further, the jury found that the way in which the mobilisation and transfer of the prison contract had been conducted, probably more than minimally contributed to the deaths.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Matters of Operational Concern While the evidence called at inquest relates to HMP Lowdham Grange, these issues are likely to be relevant across the prison estate, and for that reason I highlight my concerns to both the Minister for Prisons and NHS England as commissioners for prison healthcare. 1. Recruitment, retention and training of prison and healthcare staff (response required by the Minister for Prisons and NHSE) Staffing levels I heard compelling evidence from prison and healthcare staff who told me they were overwhelmed, over- burdened and under-supported in their work at HMP Lowdham Grange. I understand from both prison providers (Serco and Sodexo) and the Healthcare Trust (Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust), that recruitment and retention of staff was a persistent challenge, meaning more often than not the staff on shift were required to cover more than their fair workload. This led to low staff morale, higher levels of sickness absence, and an inevitable deterioration in prisoner safety. The inadequate prison and healthcare staffing levels led to a restricted regime and healthcare provision. The prison was unable to offer keywork to all men, and the mental health team could no longer offer a named nurse service. Both of these aspects of care are fundamental to supporting the most vulnerable prisoners. For months prior to the deaths, the Trust failed to fulfil its commissioned obligations to provide a nurse during night state. Prison staff have only basic first aid training and lacked the expertise of a medical professional when attempting to provide CPR to Anthony. Skill mix and experience I am concerned by the failure to retain experienced prison officers and healthcare staff. The private prison operator and the Authority were focused on the number of staff, rather than the skills set or experience of the staffing body as a whole. One PCO told me that he was considered the most senior on shift in the houseblock with less than 2 years' experience of working as a prison officer. The healthcare team had worked for a protracted period with no permanent Head of Service in post. Without a sufficient number of experienced staff, the prison had lost organisational memory, allowing poor custom and practice to become the norm amongst inexperienced and overwhelmed staff. Training All of the prison staff had completed the ITC programme, and yet there was widespread evidence of failures to do the basics. Staff failed to ensure the welfare of prisoners at roll count, failed to challenge flagrant breaches of prison rules such as passing items under cell doors, and did not know how to properly deal with obscured cell observation hatches. This calls into question the adequacy of their basic training, and the system for supervision and mentoring during the early years of practice. Healthcare staff were often not included in the same training as prison staff, and where agency staff were used to fill vacancies, they were not part of Trust training. Again, this led to poor custom and practice such as failing to read medical records before reviewing the mental health and wellbeing of the prisoners. Accepting there is a complex interplay between staffing numbers, experience and quality of training, I highlight to you my concern that continued understaffing of prison and healthcare teams will undoubtedly contribute to future deaths in custody. 2. A complete failure to identify and share risk pertinent information between prison and healthcare staff, and within those teams (response required from the Minister for Prisons, NHSE, Serco, Sodexo and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust) The staff remaining at the prison in March 2023 were, by their own admission, firefighting what was in front of them, rather than working in a collaborative and holistic way to better serve prisoner safety. There was a complete breakdown in the system of risk identification and information sharing. Prison and healthcare staff did not routinely consider information captured within the electronic systems, nor did they update the systems with risk pertinent information gathered during interactions with the prisoners. The prison records (the core file and P-NOMIS) and healthcare records (systemone) are a valuable source of risk pertinent information, that will enable prison and healthcare staff to comply with the mandatory requirement of PSI 64/2011 “All staff who have contact with prisoners must be aware of the triggers that may increase the risk of suicide, self-harm or violence, and take appropriate action.” Many prison and healthcare witnesses believed there was no working system in place at HMP Lowdham Grange to allow them to identify and share risk pertinent information. As a result, operational decisions were made in silo, and interactions with Anthony, David and Rolandas, were conducted without due consideration of their risk pertinent information. This causes concern from both a training and policy perspective. It would be impossible for prison and healthcare staff to remember the triggers for each and every prisoner in their care. Therefore, the system in place needs to make it as easy as possible for staff to quickly and readily understand the risk that exits for the prisoner and what might trigger that risk to materialise in any given circumstance. In this case, as in previous deaths, there was excessive focus on the prisoner's current presentation (i.e. the absence of saying they were going to harm themselves) without any understanding of their previous self-harm and suicidality. Specific missed opportunities included:  a failure by prison and healthcare staff to read the incoming prisoner's core file. This hard copy file contains valuable information such as previous ACCT documents and SASH warning forms, yet instead of reviewing this material and pulling out key triggers for past self-harm and suicidality and recording the same on P-NOMIS and/or systemone, the files were sent straight to storage. This is despite the fact that a background history of deliberate self-harm is an evidence- based risk factor for suicide as set out in PSI 64/2011  Healthcare staff concluding on Friday 3 March 2023 that Anthony's inability to attend a candle lighting service might be a trigger for self-harm, but such was not communicated to prison staff or safer custody or recorded on any prison systems  David's PNOMIS file clearly indicated his fear of joining the general prison population led to him requiring VP status in his previous establishment. However, the officers who sought to move him from the induction wing had not read his notes nor were they aware of the content of his previous ACCTs. HMPPS, prison and healthcare providers need to carefully scrutinise the system for identifying risk pertinent information to ensure that the staff on the ground know how and when to access that information to support timely risk assessment when engaging with prisoners. This is especially important in the early days in custody setting, but not exclusively so. I am also concerned by the use of email to convey risk pertinent information. In this case, prison staff communicated their concerns about Anthony's mental health to individual nursing Sodexo email inboxes, which the nurses were not expected to regularly access. The use of email means that such concerns are not accessible to other members of staff as they would be if they were recorded in PNOMIS or Systemone. Again, this needs to be addressed in policy and re-enforced in training. Staff told me that while the PSI mandates they should be aware of risks and triggers, there was no clearly documented system setting out how and when this should occur. 3. The system for transfer of prisoners between establishments is disorganised and unsafe (Minister for Prisons) I heard evidence in the course of exploring David's death, that he was transferred from the vulnerable prisoner unit ('VPU') at HMP Chelmsford to HMP Lowdham Grange, a prison which did not offer a VPU. David had been afforded VP status as a result of publicity about his business affairs and the nature of the offence that had resulted in his incarceration. He was scared that he might be targeted for violence and/or extorsion by fellow prisoners on account of this. David had been on 4 open ACCTs at HMP Chelmsford and had told his ACCT case co-ordinator that he was fearful of losing his VP status on transfer. While the Prison Director said he would have expected both HMP Chelmsford and HMP Lowdham Grange to have spoken about this risk in advance of the transfer, there is no evidence that any individual fully explored this potential trigger, and David was not informed that his VP status was being rescinded on leaving HMP Chelmsford. Between 20 October 2021 and 10 January 2022, Anthony made 17 applications to transfer to another prison because he did not feel safe at HMP Lowdham Grange. There were numerous intelligence reports to substantiate that Anthony was at risk of harm from others, and that, on occasion, he had been assaulted. Anthony's applications were dealt with in a haphazard manner. He did not receive a formal answer to his transfer request and had to chase many times for updates. This left Anthony feeling frustrated. I heard evidence that there is no formal policy framework or system for managing the progress of prison- to-prison transfers, including a lack of expected response times or formal escalation plan if a prison fails to provide any response. Notwithstanding the pressures on prison population management, it was agreed that the system for administering such applications should be co-ordinated and predictable, regardless of the success or otherwise of the application, rather than leading to prisoner frustration in waiting for answers that never come. 4. Failure to reduce isolation of Foreign National Prisoners (Minister for Prisons) Prison can be an isolating experience for any prisoner, but especially so for one who does not speak English. I heard evidence that the Big Word translation service did not work on multiple occasions across multiple sites within the prison. Staff gave evidence that even when the system did connect, they could be waiting in a queue for up to an hour to access an appropriate interpreter. There was no plan to seek to reduce Rolandas' obvious isolation, and seemingly no provision for expediting his induction so that he could be housed with fellow Lithuanian speakers. I have seen no evidence of a national or local plan to support Foreign National Prisoners. There is a clear risk of future self-inflicted deaths if language barriers and isolation are not adequately addressed. 5. Drugs (Minister for Prisons) HMP Lowdham Grange, like many establishments, continues to face challenges related to novel psychoactive substance misuse. There is no requirement for prisons to have an NPS specific drug policy and I am concerned that generic drug reduction strategies are ineffective against this particular threat. NPS is highly dangerous and carries a risk of death. I am concerned that more young men will die in custody as a result of NPS use. Matters relating to the transfer of the prison contract 6. The process of transferring the prison from one private provider to another, lacked sufficient scrutiny of the safety of the prison before, during and after the contract exit/transfer process (Minister for Prisons) Safety was not front and centre of the Mobilisation and Transfer project. I heard evidence from the HMPPS witnesses that there was a willingness to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. However, I invite a formal response detailing exactly what action has been taken or is proposed, as it is likely that further transfers shall occur across departments when PFIs expire, or contracts change provider. Matters relating to learning from deaths in custody 7. Persistent Failure to learn from deaths over many years (Serco Justice Director, Minister for Prisons) Embedding learning from deaths I heard evidence that many of the contributory factors leading to the deaths of Anthony, David and Rolandas, had been raised as issues in the investigations following previous deaths in custody at HMP Lowdham Grange. While Serco no longer manage HMP Lowdham Grange, they continue to manage prisons, and there is a risk of future deaths if the organisation is unable to create a robust culture of seeking to identify issues early, adopt learning, and continually monitor culture to ensure any action taken is embedded to reduce the risk of future deaths. From a HMPPS perspective, while private prison providers assume the operational risks of running the establishment, the HMPPS Controllers remain responsible for assuring a safe, decent and secure prison. I am concerned that the Controllers at HMP Lowdham Grange did not have a sufficient grasp of the longstanding cultural issues pertaining to safety. This raises the question of the efficacy of the Controller role and exactly how Controllers assure themselves that the provider is learning from deaths. 8. A failure to act with candour when engaging in post-death investigations (Minister for Prisons, Serco, Sodexo) Full, frank and timely disclosure of potentially relevant material to those investigating deaths The quality of any post-death investigation is predicated by the openness, honesty and transparency of the agencies involved. This inquest was beset with disclosure failures by HMPPS. A significant volume of disclosure, running to thousands of pages, was provided to the court towards the end of the hearing despite many months of active case management. HMPPS conduct their business primarily through emails, rather than any case management system, and it took a long time to review and supply this material to the court. HMPPS have no effective system for gathering, retaining, reviewing and disclosing potentially relevant material so that the issues relevant to death can be identified and learning put in place. If the process of learning from deaths is obfuscated by failures in the disclosure process, there is a risk that deaths will occur in the future from matters which could and should have been rectified. Candour The Healthcare Trust are subject to a statutory duty of candour. HMPPS, Serco and Sodexo failed to embrace the same ethos during these investigations. Consequently, there was minimal acceptance of the risk factors set out above, all of which may cause or contribute to deaths in the prison in the future. I have shared my concerns previously with those at HMP Lowdham Grange (PFD report relating to Christopher Howard Smith, dated 7 July 2023). I am troubled that unless there is a radical change in culture, and reflective learning from deaths is prioritised, prisoners will continue to die in custody. It is most concerning that there is a marked discrepancy between the failings that were admitted in oral evidence by the vast majority of witnesses when faced with irrefutable evidence, against the written statements submitted to the coronial investigations which contained very little, if any, reflection and candour. Even after the evidence had been called, the prison organisations did not respond to my request to advance admissions in order to relieve the jury of the burden of making findings on each and every issue. I would like to understand any action proposed by the Minister, Serco and Sodexo to address the issue of candour. 6",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

The inquest was concluded on 30 th July 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1a. Suspension. The narrative conclusion was that: Charne Petit suffered from psychotic delusions which she found extremely distressing. From 2019 to 2022 she was treated by the early intervention in psychosis team. Thereafter her care was transferred to the community mental health team. Her symptoms and mood fluctuated, in addition, on occasions, non- compliance with anti-psychotic medication and use of illicit drugs triggered relapses in her mental health. On the 26th March 2023 she suffered a psychotic breakdown and was assessed under the Mental Health Act and found to meet the requirements for detention under s2. No mental health bed was available. She was nursed one to one in the Royal Surrey County Hospital by nurses from the psychiatric liaison team. She was re-started on aripiprazole and her mood stabilized. She was discharged to the home treatment team on the 31st March 2023 without an assessment followed by medical treatment in a mental health hospital. On the 24th April she was seen by her care coordinator and reported intrusive psychotic delusions and struggling to manage her emotions. On the 25th April 2023 she represented to Royal Surrey County Hospital having abused drugs. She was assessed not to require a mental health assessment and discharged. On the 12th May 2023 she killed herself by suspending herself [REDACTED]. The death was preventable with more effective treatment of her psychosis. The lack of a mental health bed after she was assessed as detainable under s2 more than minimally contributed to the death. She died by Suicide","See the details set out in the narrative conclusion. In addition: Ms Petit was reviewed in hospital on the 29 th March 2023 by a consultant from the liaison psychiatry team. Her presentation had improved since admission and in his opinion, so long as she continued to improve, she could be discharged to the home treatment team and that this was the least restrictive option. The effect of the discharge on the 31 st March 2023 was that Ms Petit was not admitted to a mental health hospital under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and was therefore discharged without having been assessed comprehensively in a mental health hospital.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Evidence given by the court appointed expert consultant psychiatrist was that Ms Petit was not adequately medicalised and that she needed assessment and medical review with optimisation of treatment in a mental health hospital. Her response to treatment needed to be observed. This is what a s2 admission is designed to effect. The lack of a bed in a mental health hospital denied Ms Petit this opportunity for optimal treatment. (2) The Court heard that owing to a shortage of mental health beds patients who have been assessed by 2 s12 consultant psychiatrists to require detention after a mental health act assessment are being effectively detained in general hospitals without a section, awaiting a bed, because they cannot be placed under section unless a mental health bed is available. 6",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1st December 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased had died from hanging, and the conclusion was suicide.","Katharine Fox was being treated at home following a stay as an in-patient in Broomfield Hospital. Some of that stay had involved the deceased being detained under section 2 Mental Health Act 1983. While being treated in hospital, the deceased obtained psychology treatment in the form of a series of sessions with a trainee psychologist with whom she built a good clinical relationship and from which she reported benefiting significantly. Following her discharge from hospital, this psychology treatment effectively came to an end, since the procedures for receiving this treatment in the community were passed to an entirely separate set of clinicians. There was an entirely separate procedure for referral and provision of psychology sessions, with a very significant wait, and the deceased never in fact secured access to those services in the months between being discharged (in May 2022) and her death in October 2022. I was also told by the witness conducting EPUT's own investigation that the teams use separate notes, and it may not always be possible for those notes to be accessed by other teams.

He died on the 31.12.22.”","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1) Oliver had been at HMP Hewell since 20.10.22. He was a man with long- standing mental health issues, for whom this was a first experience of custody. After a steady deterioration in his mental state, a mental health referral on 17.11.22 led to a belated mental health examination conducted by a registered learning disability nurse on 6.12.22. In the week leading up to the nurse's assessment: (a) A prison officer had made an urgent TAG mental health referral on 30.11.22, citing concerns that Oliver was experiencing active thoughts of self-harm or suicide, and that he ( the officer ) had “mild concerns” about intentional self-harm, and there were “definite indicators” of unintentional self-harm; and (b) Oliver himself had submitted a healthcare application form asking to see a doctor, saying that he was “extremely depressed”, his anxiety was “really high” and he was “not coping at all, please help”; These important events were not highlighted on Oliver's SystmOne medical record, and so the nurse conducting the assessment 6.12.22 was not aware of either of these important recent events, and did not take them into account when assessing Oliver; 2) Oliver was allocated a care coordinator on 6.12.12 following the nurse's assessment. An appointment was fixed for Oliver to meet the care coordinator for the first time on 14.12.22. Due to workload pressures, the care coordinator was unable to fulfil that appointment before he went on leave from 16- 28.12.22. Shortly before he went on leave, the care coordinator conducted a “RAG rating” exercise to determine whether he should prioritise seeing Oliver, and determined that Oliver's case merited the lowest priority RAG rating ( green ). When conducting that RAG rating exercise, the care coordinator did not take into account: (a) The prison officer's urgent TAG mental health referral of 30.11.22 ( above ); and (b) A further TAG mental health referral made by a prison paramedic which cited “mild concerns” about both deliberate and unintentional self-harm on Oliver's part, the details of which had been entered onto Oliver's SystmOne medical record. In addition, the care coordinator did not raise in the mental health team's daily forum.the fact that he was unlikely to have time to see Oliver before he went on leave. Had the care coordinator taken into account the referrals at (a)-(b) above, and raised at the daily forum his difficulty in being able to see Oliver, it may well have been that Oliver's case would have merited a more urgent response from the care coordinator or someone else in his stead. 4 Having heard evidence at the inquest from your Trust's Clinical Director, , I was not satisfied that the Trust has fully recognized the above shortcomings, and taken action to ensure that they are not repeated for other mental health patients in custody at HMP Hewell. 6",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 October 2023. I made a narrative determination, which I attach.","Michael Hindes killed himself [REDACTED]. One week before he died, he called 999 because he felt suicidal. This was late in the evening on Monday, 8 May. Police attended and took him to St George's Hospital, where he underwent a half hour mental health assessment, after which he was discharged in the early hours.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. When Michael was taken to St George's Hospital, he explained that he had been back and forth from the railway station, each He was discharged with a plan for follow up by the community mental health team (CMHT). I was told that the local CMHT meets at the beginning of every week, and then there is sometimes a delay before an appointment is made, so it was likely that Michael would have to wait an absolute minimum of a week to be seen. In the meantime, it was not thought necessary to refer him to the crisis team. Michael's family knew nothing of his mental ill health. He declined an invitation by the nurse assessing him to contact them. He did not want to worry them. Despite her awareness of the multiple therapeutic benefits of the input of a patient's loved ones, the assessing nurse did not in any way try to persuade Michael to allow her to do this. The first that Michael's family heard of Michael's mental ill health was when they heard of his death. I am sure that, had they been made aware of it while he was still alive, they would have done everything in their power to support him and to engage with the mental health services. Families very often complain to me at inquest that mental health services have not done enough to try to bring them in to a patient's care.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5th March 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Jean Pike was a vulnerable women aged 54 at the time of death and had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and suffered from a depressive illness. Jean resided in supported accommodation and was under secondary mental health care. In the three months prior to her death Jean's mental health deteriorated and she engaged in serious self-harm to manage her suicidal thoughts. At this time all those involved with Jean knew she was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was expressing an intention to hang herself and was impulsive. Jean had two hospital admissions in the three weeks before her death and during this time support staff at Jean's accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator were clearly communicating to the acute hospital where Jean was admitted on both occasions that they could not keep Jean safe in the community in her supported accommodation and that they were concerned that Jean was going to hang herself. Seven days before Jean's death a decision was taken by a consultant psychiatrist to discharge Jean from hospital nine hours after she had been admitted and at time when Jean was still actively experiencing suicidal thoughts. This decision was taken without any consultation with the professionals involved with Jean and there was no risk assessment of Jean's risk of suicide undertaken by the consultant before Jean was discharged. I find that these actions including the decision to discharge Jean from hospital constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. On the day of her death Jean experienced a 2 mental health crisis at her supported accommodation and was threatening to hang herself. This was known to support staff at Jean's supported accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator but despite this an inadequate safety plan was put in place to safeguard Jean. Jean was left unattended for between 20 – 45 minutes during which time Jean took her own life by hanging. I find that the failure to put in place a robust safety plan and leaving Jean unattended constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. I find that Jean took her own life and that she intended to do so, and that Jean's death was contributed to by neglect. 4",On 18 May 2022 Jean Pike was stating that she was suicidal and intending to hang herself. Jean Pike was left unattended and unobserved for between 20 – 45 minutes. Jean Pike was then found suspended in her supported living accommodation on 18 May 2022 and declared deceased at 14.27.,"During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. I am concerned that Jean was discharged from Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital on two occasions shortly before her death by a consultant psychiatrist and that prior to the decision to discharge on both occasions there was no multi-disciplinary meeting between the consultant on Ward F and the professionals directly involved in caring for Jean in the community about Jean's mental health and the risks she posed to herself in the community. This was in circumstances where the consultant knew before the decisions to discharge that these professionals, which included Jean's care co- ordinator, were clearly stating that they were extremely concerned about Jean's mental health and that they did not consider that they could keep Jean safe in the community and that they thought that Jean would hang herself in the community – which is in fact what happened in this case. I am particularly concerned by the evidence I heard from Jean's care co-ordinator that care co-ordinators are rarely if ever consulted by consultant psychiatrists in Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital before a decision is made to discharge a patient/person under secondary mental health care. This issue was not identified by Swansea University Bay Health Board ('SUBHB') in their internal investigation into Jean's death. This investigation found that “there is evidence of regular and effective communication between support staff, community staff and hospital staff”. The above finding of SUBHB's internal investigation raises a concern that critical lessons have not being identified and learnt by SUBHB from Jean's death about the importance of multi-disciplinary decision making in clinical care and risk management and the importance of including care co-ordinators and professionals in the community before a decision is taken to discharge a patient from Ward F. This creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. I am also concerned that if there is a lack of clarity or a reluctance in Ward F at the consultant level to engage with care co-ordinators and professionals in the community (and before decisions are made to discharge) there is a risk that the concerns of the professionals managing a patient/person under secondary care will not be adequately considered in the decisions made by Ward F 3 clinicians. This also creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. 6",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

The investigation concluded on the 29th January 2023 and the conclusion was one of Suicide . The medical cause of death was 1a) Hanging.,"Tobias Mannering-Jones was very vulnerable. He became homeless at the end of December 2022. He had no support network. He generally slept at the Hostel for homeless people in Tameside where he was exposed to abuse due to his sexuality, felt unsafe, and was in the company of people who were significantly greater users of hard drugs. He had mental health issues dating back to his childhood trauma that were greatly exacerbated by his homelessness. He increased his use of drugs to cope with his deteriorating situation, he was also sexually exploited. After he became homeless, he sought help for his spiralling situation. On 6th January he saw the mental health worker attached to his GP practice. Concerns regarding his vulnerability in the homeless accommodation were expressed. He spoke to that worker again on the 9th February at an appointment. His contacts with other agencies in the interim were not known of. He was also seen by Pennine Care Mental Health Liaison after he went to A&E on 15th January, 17th January and 14th February 2023. He indicated thoughts of self-harm with a key issue being his homelessness and the consequential impact on his mental health, drug use and support network exacerbated by the fact he had no telephone or address. He contacted CGL for help on 6th February 2023 to try and obtain help for substance misuse. Attempts to contact him for assessment were unsuccessful given his lack of a telephone. He was under the care of the neighbourhood mental health team and had been offered support from the Big Life Group previously. He was still awaiting assessment for therapy. Contact ceased with them, and they were not involved in planning how his discharges from the acute hospital would be managed in the community. Adult Social Care were contacted, by Tobias, asking for help on 8th February 2023. He was allocated a Social Worker on 14th February. Attempts to contact Tobias were unsuccessful due to his lack of telephone and homelessness. On 21st February 2023 Tobias was found [REDACTED] at Portland Basin Marina. Police found no suspicious circumstances. Post-mortem examination included toxicology. He was found to have evidence of limited cocaine use and alcohol use in the hours prior to his death. He had last been seen alive the afternoon before. No concerns for welfare had been raised following him last being seen. It is probable that had Tobias not been homeless, isolated and vulnerable and had there been a co-ordinated approach to supporting him he would not have taken his own life on 21st February 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest was told that Tobias had sought and had been referred for mental health support however due to the high demand and long waiting lists 2 he was still on a waiting list at the time of his death. The evidence before the inquest was that long delays were still an issue and were not restricted to Tameside but were part of a national picture of delays and long waiting lists for those seeking help with their mental health. 2. The inquest also heard evidence of the impact of homelessness and consequential vulnerability on a young person like Tobias and that the demands on Local Authorities meant that even where vulnerability was recognised there were not resources to offer sustained support and stable housing solutions. The evidence was that as a consequence young vulnerable people had to rely on homeless shelters where they were exposed to additional negative influences and as in Tobias's case abuse due to their sexuality. 3. Evidence was also heard that a person who has to rely on a homeless shelter can then become uncontactable to public service providers as they have no address for contact which means they then have even less chance of accessing support. 4. The inquest was told that young adults who are homeless are often sexually exploited and that those who identify as LGBTQIA can be particularly vulnerable and that the underlying vulnerability and risk was not always appreciated by those dealing with young homeless people and that it could be mistaken by agencies as a lifestyle choice rather than what it actually was, i.e., exploitation by an older adult. 5. The evidence before the inquest was that where multiple agencies were involved it was fundamental that one agency/person took overall ownership/responsibility to ensure a coordinated and effective approach using regular MDTs to understand the information that all agencies had in their possession and to offer effective support. 6",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6th March 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Drug & Alcohol Related. The medical cause of death was; 1a Cardiac Arrhythmia 1b Chronic Excess Alcohol Consumption and Use Of Amphetamine. I found at inquest, Stevyn Carr died on 16th November 2021 at 17 Lytchfeld, Leam Lane, Gateshead from a cardiac arrhythmia caused by the toxic effects of him voluntarily consuming a quality of alcohol and amphetamines at some point prior to his death. His intention in doing so was not to end his life.","Stevyn Carr contacted Northumbria Police on the evening of 15th November 2021 at 7.22pm. His contact with police call handlers and emergency operators was difficult to understand, due to on balance to his intoxication. He did ask for 'Help' and he was told police would attend. The calls to police were assessed a Grade 2 response – normally within an hour. No police attended until they entered Stevyn Carr's address at 12.02pm on 16th November after members of his family contacted the police at 10.38am to express their concerns for him. He was discovered dead when police entered his home. On the evidence heard it was not possible to ascertain whether earlier police attendance would have altered the outcome. From the first call to police to his discovery by police a period of 16 hours 40 minutes elapsed.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The evidence I heard at inquest indicated the level of police response should have been classed as a Grade 2 Vulnerable to ensure a more timely response. (2) No oversight of the incident took place for over 9 hours and at that a comment was made that there were no resources able to attend, but no other options/alternatives were pursued. (3) The family of Stevyn Carr contacted police some 15 hours after the first call to the police and after this a further 1 hour and 23 minutes elapsed before police went to his address and found him. (4) I heard evidence at inquest that a number of incidents were 'delayed' for a significant period for lack of police resources and this position was common place at that time. (5) I have asked for evidence to satisfy me that the position in terms of police attendance has improved both within the area Stevyn Carr died, but across the Northumbria Police force area. The evidence I have received is difficult to interpret and not comprehensive. I am concerned whether the changes to the management of incidents and/or training in relation to the grading of incidents by Northumbria Police has improved since Stevyn Carr's death, to the extent that the timeliness of police response to requests from the public for assistance is improved and is improving. 6",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

Chair of the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 2. , Chief Executive at Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 3. , Estates and facilities management consultant/director at Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 1.",On 13 th August 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Henok Zaid GEBRSSLASIE (aged 23 years). The investigation concluded at the end the inquest on 5 th March 2025 at Coventry Coroners Court. The conclusion of the death of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was that death was “suicide and a narrative” a copy of which I attach to this report.,"Mr GEBRSSLASIE on the 2nd August 2021 was arrested by the police having been removed from a bus in possession of a plank of wood and oddly offering the police money sufficient for bus fare, this and his behaviour , throwing a road sign at officers precipitated his detention in police custody which gave rise to a mental health act assessment and his detention at the Caludon Centre. Part of his medical treatment included antipsychotic medication and sedation following an episode of violence. On 5th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE absconded from the Caludon Centre via a window, however he was located at his home address and returned to the Caludon Centre the next day and remained detained (under the Menal Health Act) on the Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, his behaviour leading staff to provide him with rip-proof clothing. There was an issue with language, involved communications achieved with an interpreter. Over the following days, in the context of medications provided, his mood was now adjudged seemingly more stable and by the 12th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE was allowed his own clothing, rip proof clothing removed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was provide some hospital type pyjamas whist his personal clothing was being washed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was on level 2 observations (every 15 minutes) and having expression a wish to go home it was communicated to him that his discharge from hospital was an ongoing process and not imminent. On 12th August 2021, the body of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was discovered in his bedroom (Bedroom 2) on Sherbourne Ward nearly 3 hours after his last observation. The deceased had a ligature ([REDACTED]) around his neck and was partially suspended from the bedroom door. The Oxevision system camera (part of a research project, to assess whether new non-contact monitoring technology improves quality of care and safety for patients and staff) in the patients' rooms captured the last interactions Mr GEBRSSLASIE has with staff, where upon moments after the bedroom door closed Mr GEBRSSLASIE then proceeded to use the same bedroom door as an anchor point for the ligature.","During the inquest, the evidence and information revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report them to you. The MATTER(S) OF CONCERN are as follows: i. The inquest explored issues such ligature anchor points. ii. It is known (and has been known for some years by the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust) that the top of a door is a “high risk area” for ligatures in particular patients bedroom which have doors that may be locked by patients from the inside and thereby an unobserved patient area. iii. The circumstances of this inquest touching upon the death of Henok GEBRSSLASIE in August 2021 accentuated this point. iv. Such risks carrying with it a clear risk of death. v. Since the incident it was known that door top alarms is “the way forward” as an environmental change that would mitigate such risk and referred to in a serious investigation report in April 2023, this “way forward” expressed in evidence during the inquest. vi. There remains (now 42 months post Mr GEBRSSLASIEs death) no door top alarms on the patient bedroom doors at Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, at the Caludon Centre. vii. The cumulative effect (there 'seemingly' no expediency to physically better mitigate this known environmental high-risk issue) is such that a concern as to future deaths exists as of March 2025. 6.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
