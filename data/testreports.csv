The conclusion of the inquest was that the cause of death for the late Mr. Harris was due to a road traffic collision, including the medical cause of death of multiple traumatic injuries. 4","On the 23 August 2024 the late Mr. Harris was driving a motor car on the A483 at Sweeney, Oswestry, Shropshire when it was in collision with an oncoming Heavy Goods Vehicle. Mr. Harris lost control of his vehicle and drifted across into the part of the oncoming vehicle due most likely to a medical condition. 2 5 CORONER’S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. • The medical condition of the deceased was known. He was known to have suffered blackouts and was also in addition to a car driving licence, the holder of an HGV licence. The deceased had informed his own GP that he was no longer driving and had notified DVLA. Neither appear to have been correct. Additionally, in order to renew his HGV licence, the deceased completed a form DP4 on the 19 August 2024 which was accompanied by a Medical examination report of the same date. • For whatever reason the deceased did not seek the medical report from his own GP, who would have known about his medical condition and who therefore would not have been able to support the application. Instead the deceased went to an independent GP and that GP completed the medical examination report based solely on what the deceased had told him (and without disclosing his medical condition) without having access to his medical records. • A statement from DVLA relating to this inquest tells us that a driver is recommended to have their own GP complete the examination and the D4 medical report but there is no obligation on drivers to see their own GP. • The concern is if a driver is prepared to provide inaccurate information to the DVLA there is nothing to prevent him doing the same to an independent GP who has no means of checking the accuracy of the information given to them. It then raises the question, what is the purpose and value of a driver being able to provide information to an independent GP who is not in a position to confirm its accuracy? • In my view, consideration should be given as to whether a report from the driver’s own GP should be required or, if not, an independent GP should be able to have access to the medical records themselves. • 4 days after completing the 2 forms the fatal accident occurred, with additional injury and loss to others. 6"

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, NATIONAL HIGHWAYS 1","On 15th August 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of Alexander Charles Edward Thomas, aged 42. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13th January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that he died from multiple injuries consistent with a road traffic collision when he committed suicide. 4",Mr Thomas died on 14th August 2024 when he entered the eastbound carriageway of the M56 motorway between junctions . A heavy goods vehicle collided with him when he deliberately stood in its path and he sustained fatal injuries. He had a longstanding diagnosis of depressive disorder.

During the inquest, I heard that is a pedestrian walkway running underneath the M56 motorway. On the northern side of the motorway (eastbound carriageway side) the entrance to the walkway tunnel is constructed so that the buttress walls form a ramp-like structure which has a shallow gradient topped with a waist-high railing which provides an easily accessible and walkable route from the footpath to the Armco crash barrier bordering the hard shoulder of the eastbound motorway carriageway. 2. Also leading from is an established track through undergrowth running west parallel to the motorway. That path leads directly to a fixed bespoke metal ladder which appears to be specifically positioned so as to enable a person to climb up to the Armco crash barrier bordering the hard shoulder of the eastbound carriageway. 3. There is no fencing to prevent access over the Armco crash barrier onto the motorway itself along this stretch of the eastbound carriageway, in contrast to the substantial fencing positioned behind the Armco crash barrier along the opposite stretch of the westbound carriageway. 2"

The inquest was resumed and concluded upon 07/01/2025. I found the cause of death to be:- 1a. Chest injuries The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision. With a finding in box 3 that: On 26/09/2023 Angela Stacey Carney sustained fatal injuries after she emerged at speed on her mobility scooter from Westcliffe Road junction and into the path of a vehicle being driven along Westgate. It is found more likely than not that she inadvertently placed her scooter into freewheel drive and this prevented her from braking or taking evasive action. 4","On the afternoon of 26/09/2023, Angela left her home address on her 2005 model Monarch Compact special edition, 4 wheel, single seater mobility scooter. Before setting off she moved her scooter out of her front garden and onto the footpath on Westcliffe Road by activating the free wheel mode via a lever near the rear wheel. Westcliffe Road has a 4.7% downward gradient on the southerly approach to a give way junction with Westgate. Angela, contrary to the instruction manual did not take the scooter off the free wheel drive by engaging the engine with her ignition key. As a consequence, she was unable to stop the scooter because the brakes could only be activated by engine engagement. This resulted in the scooter proceeding down the footpath of Westcliffe Road at speed towards the junction with Westgate and directly into the path of a Nissan Navana pickup, resulting in her suffering severe injuries to which she sadly succumbed notwithstanding treatment at the hospital and died. It was found that the circumstance of the collision was such that it prevented the driver of the Nissan from taking evasive action. At the inquest it was noted that Angela had previously purchased the scooter second hand from her neighbour and that it was not manufactured with a secondary (independent) braking mechanism. The scooter was found to be roadworthy and without any defects to have contributed to the collision and if the instruction manual had been followed, the scooter it could have been used safely. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 That said I was concerned to find that there was no fail-safe breaking mechanism on the scooter to enable an emergency stop to take place in the event of the inadvertence of the rider. 5 CORONER’S CONCERNS Although it is my understanding that more recently designed and manufactured mobility scooters are manufactured with a secondary breaking system by way of a fitted hand brake mechanism, I am concerned that other manufacturers may be producing scooters without such an independent breaking mechanism. I also have a concern that there may be many other older second hand models on the second hand market that are being used, which all combined has worrying safety implications for the rider’s and members of the public.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 January 2025 and my conclusion as to the death was one of Road Traffic Collision. 4","At approximately 22:45 hours on Friday 24th March 2023, a fatal road traffic collision occurred on the A361 North Bar Street, Banbury, Oxfordshire. A red Nissan Pixo collided with a pedestrian, Anthony Paine on the A361 North Bar Street, Banbury. Mr. Paine was crossing the carriageway on a pedestrian crossing from right to left as viewed by the driver of the Nissan. The pedestrian crossing was controlled by traffic signals. Mr Paine did not wait to use the pedestrian controlled lights having considered the that the road was clear. He was struck by the vehicle and sadly died at the scene. 5 CORONER’S CONCERNS During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make this report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are in relation to the following: • The speed limit on the A361 North Bar Street at the location of the collision is 30 mph. There was a concern expressed at the Inquest that this speed limit may be too high, given the characteristics of the road and the volume of pedestrian traffic in the area. 2 • The A361 at this location is a long, straight, single carriageway with one lane in each direction. Traveling southbound, the pedestrian crossing is approached from a gradual rise in the road from Banbury Cross Roundabout, some 150 meters away. The rise in the road obscures the view of the pedestrian crossing to approaching vehicles. • There are a number of pubs and restaurants on both sides of the road and a number of pedestrians in the area late into the evening. • The Forensic Collision Investigator concluded that in the short window of time in which Mr. Paine was likely visible to the driver, they failed to see him. The Investigator’s evidence was that even if the driver had seen Mr. Paine, there would have been insufficient time to react and avoid the collision. However, the Investigator’s evidence also stated that if the vehicle had been traveling at a slower speed, this may have provided the driver with sufficient time to react and either avoid the collision or reduce the severity of the impact. • In the opinion of the Forensic Collision Investigator, the speed of the driver’s vehicle was 32.6 mph ± 3.6 mph and was a contributing factor to the severity of the collision and that, as a general point, the slower the vehicle is travelling the less severe the effects of any impact. • It was further noted that other nearby town/city centres (eg Oxford) have introduced 20 mph speed limits on roads in the city centre. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 6th March 2025. I may extend the period on request. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 December 2024. The medical cause of death was found as follows: 1a Multiple Injuries 1b Road Traffic Collision 2 Information Classification: PUBLIC The four questions - who, when, where and how – were answered as follows: Nigel William SWEET died on 7 March 2024 on the A38 between Trerulefoot and Tideford Cornwall from injuries sustained after he lost control of his motorcycle due to rider error whilst attempting to complete an overtake of another vehicle in wet conditions. The motorcycle fell onto its side as Nigel lost control. Nigel was separated from his motorcycle and he slid across the carriageway into the path of an oncoming vehicle which was unable to avoid him despite emergency braking and steering input. That oncoming vehicle drove over Nigel who suffered unsurvivable injuries as a consequence. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows: Road Traffic Collision 4","The reason for the collision was found to be rider error by Nigel, in wet road conditions whilst attempting an overtake in a creeper lane. A creeper lane is an additional lane, added to a single carriageway for a short stretch to allow for overtaking. There are a number on this stretch of the A38 which present road users with brief opportunities to overtake slower moving vehicles, before the road reverts to single carriageway on both sides. Nigel had overtaken at least one vehicle and was attempting to overtake a second vehicle by using the additional lane of the creeper lane. There was steady and oncoming traffic on the other carriageway. Nigel had insufficient space in the creeper lane to safely complete the overtaking manoeuvre of the second vehicle. Nigel lost control of his motorcycle whilst under braking at which time he was likely trying to get back into the single carriageway at the end of the creeper lane. In that sense the creeper lane contributed to the collision. The court found that there was nothing that the driver of the oncoming vehicle could have done to avoid Nigel. 5 CORONER’S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 3 Information Classification: PUBLIC (1) The court found that this stretch of the A38 from Carkeel roundabout to Trerulefoot roundabout has a history of a higher proportion of road traffic collisions compared to equivalent roads. This is because of the nature of the A38 over this stretch which features predominantly single carriageway layout with occasional creeper lanes. (2) The court heard evidence that a safety scheme had been developed to introduce average speed cameras for this stretch of the A38 but that funding had not yet been approved. The safety scheme was specifically designed to reduce the higher proportion of collisions on this stretch of road. 6
