Department of Health and Social Care 2. Department of Education 1,"On 21 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alex Dews born on 7 November 2008. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was: On 14 July 2022 Alex Dews went to a bridge in Dearne Valley Country Park, Barnsley. He fell from the bridge to the shallow river below. It is not clear the mechanism of that fall as this was unwitnessed. It is also not clear whether Alex intended to end his life in the fall from the bridge. Alex was found by someone passing and the ambulance service attended and transported him to Sheffield Children's Hospital where he died on 18 July 2022. The medical cause of death was: 1a: Hypoxic Ischaemic Brain Injury 1b: Traumatic Brain Injury and Drowning","Alex Dews was born on 7 November 2008. Alex was born female however in his teenage years he identified as male and asked for his mum to notify his school of his change of name. Alex was loved and well supported by his family throughout his life and his family were a big source of security and support and he could readily talk to them about what he was experiencing. Alex's school acknowledged Alex's decision about his identity and immediately ensured this was communicated with the relevant people within the school and placed him on the vulnerable register in line with established practice. Due to Alex's protected characteristic this meant that he would be discussed on a weekly basis. Although there are no minutes of this meeting it is clear on the basis of the evidence that I have heard that he was discussed on a weekly basis although there were not always actions which were needed. There was an incident on 4 November 2021 [REDACTED]. There is evidence that this was on school premises and he was seeking advice from his grandmother about what to do. His grandmother has indicated in evidence that she was contacted by the school who outlined the injury. This is not documented by the school however I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this incident happened and the communication is as Alex's grandmother has described. There was then a further incident which was disclosed to Ad astra about self harm and that resulted in Alex being placed on the waiting list for iSpace (the schools counselling service) at his mother's request. This was documented on the vulnerable register on 22 November 2021. On 15 March 2022 Alex wrote a letter in school which he gave to one of his teachers indicating he wished to end his life. This resulted in a risk assessment by the safeguarding lead who subsequently pushed Alex up the iSpace waiting list and advised his mother to take him to A&E if she was concerned. On 23 March 2022 there was a further disclosure that Alex wanted to kill himself to staff at the school. On 25 March 2022 Alex commenced the counselling services from iSpace. During the second session of counselling Alex disclosed that he had taken an overdose [REDACTED]. This was conveyed from the Counsellor to the school safeguarding team and family were made aware of the disclosure. In May 2022 Alex had received his full sessions of counselling and was discharged from those counselling functions. The discharge email made reference to Alex potentially benefitting from these services in future but there was no time frame on this. It would appear that from the records and the evidence which I have heard there was an escalation in Alex's behaviour towards staff and involvement at school. This was out of character for Alex and his family would invite me to consider that this was evidence of Alex's deteriorating mental health. That said, Alex's last report at school indicated that he was putting in significant amounts of evidence at school and doing well. After his discharge from counselling services in May 2022 there is no evidence of episodes of self harm or suicidal thought in school documentation however he was still discussed each week on the vulnerability register meeting. Staff were concerned that Alex would struggle in the following year of school and therefore determined that it was appropriate at that point to make a referral into CAMHS services for Alex. This had previously been discounted on the basis that the waiting list was so long and that if Alex was in receipt of iSpace support he would not be eligible for CAMHS services. The CAMHS referral was made on the 27 June 2022. I have not heard any evidence longer term. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was no real and immediate concerns for Alex's mental health which the school had and could reasonably have done anything about from May to the point at which Alex died. That said, there are concerns about the way in which the school have documented matters and the way in which the school assess and check the assessments of pupils when there are concerns. I am also concerned that the information shared with iSpace and others is hugely subjective and not standardised in any way shape or form. I am concerned that the school is not provided information from iSpace in the form of a final report not about what the child has disclosed but in respect of any advice and guidance which is given or any other follow up actions that are required (such as future sessions being planned). I am satisfied that the referral to CAMHS was a pre-emptive measure in anticipation of Alex's following year at school. Had staff felt that Alex was at immediate risk when they made the referral on 27 June 2022 I am satisfied that they were less likely to make a referral to CAMHS and instead would have advised A&E or an escalation to iSpace. This is on the basis of the evidence which I have heard regarding the difficulties staff have had over making referrals to CAMHS.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: – 1. Alex was not referred by school to NHS mental health services as a result of their experience that if Alex was in receipt of any other support he would not be accepted onto the waiting list (which would be in excess of 10 months to be seen). 2. The school chose to provide Alex with school procured psychology support however the process of allocation of provision was not clear. 3. The school did not have a clear communication process with the provider of support to either refer the student into services or to receive outputs from those services once the student completed their sessions 6

At the inquest, which was a wider article 2 compliant inquest and lasted four days the court heard from several of those involved in Benjamin's short life, I concluded on 13 July 2023 with a narrative conclusion “Ben died as a consequence of his own actions during an episode of disturbed dissociative behaviour whilst waiting for a specialist bed to be procured in the community as a consequence of a failure to procure and provide a suitable inpatient bed to meet his needs.” 4","1. Ben Hazelden had a complex history including dyspraxia, autistic spectrum disorder, anxiety with depression and post traumatic stress disorder, the latter being due to having been abused earlier in his life. He suffered from dissociative episodes where he had at times harmed himself and others but otherwise was engaging and well-liked by those who met him. He was also in the process of seeing a neurologist given a family history of Huntingdon's disease. He was admitted to hospital as a 17 year old and transferred to adult services on reaching 18. A package was put in place for him to be transferred to the community with support from a private care provider with two members of staff being with him 24hours a day in March 2021. He initially did well and had also been seen by a psychologist from Kent and Medway Complex Autism service and was undergoing some therapy with a view to reducing his risk and stabilisation of his presentation prior to considering any long term trauma work. He had a deterioration in his mental health in July 2021 and was admitted under the provisions of the Mental Health Act to St. Martin's hospital in Canterbury. 2. He returned home in August and the dissociative incidents continued but were manageable until the end of the year when there were concerns over the increasing frequency and risks. In January 2022 he had taken himself onto train tracks near his house and was taken to the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital and assessed by liaison psychiatry who did not consider he had an acute treatable mental health problem. He stayed at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital whilst discussions ensued between the agencies involved in his care including Kent County Council, Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, Avondale, the Integrated care board and East Kent hospitals NHS Trust. Attempts were made to obtain a specialist bed and a Mental Health Act assessment on 28th January 2022 deemed him not to be detainable under the provisions of the Mental Health Act although the possibility of an informal bed was suggested as an interim solution. Ultimately it was decided that he should be discharged home with an increased package of care and now 3 carers. 3. He went home on 3rd February and on 11th February he assaulted two members of staff and ran to the nearby train station placing himself on the tracks where sadly a train coming into the station hit him. He died from his injuries at the scene. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. In the course of hearing the evidence it was clear that young adults with autism who were at risk of self-harm as well as harm to others have very limited options in terms of placements where their needs can be met. A bespoke placement had been carefully created by those involved in Ben's care but this had taken several months to arrange. This arrangement had worked well and all involved tried to make it a success and for quite some time it was. It was however recognised that there may come a time in the future when his risks to himself and others would mean an alternative placement would be needed. 2. When Ben's risks to himself increased further there were no suitable beds available where he could be cared for in an environment which could meet his needs. He spent several days in an acute hospital bed despite being medically fit for discharge which although, essentially a place of safety, was totally unsuited to his needs. This stay continued whilst discussions ensued regarding where he should be placed. A bed in an acute psychiatric ward was considered but not deemed appropriate to meet his needs and as there were no specialist beds available he was discharged back to his home with increased support as the best option available. Had a bed been available in a specialist unit it is likely that he would not have died when he did. 3. In the evidence provided it became clear that a lot of units where a specialist bed may have been available had been closed in the past due to concerns about the level of care following a number of investigations. This has led to a system whereby locally and nationally there are limited options for those requiring care relating to both the management of autism and self-harm or harm to others, particularly when there is an urgent need for increased support. Whilst the inquest heard there were some counties who had specialist beds they were difficult to access as they were often full and places were not always available to meet urgent needs 6"

Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP, Secretary of State for Health & Social Care E","On 3 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Allison Vivian Jacome Aules. Allison was 12 years old when she passed away on the 19th July 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 17th August 2023. The conclusion was that Allison died as a result of suicide, contributed to by neglect.","Allison Aules was referred to the mental health team in May 2021 with concerns around evidence of self-harm, low mood, anxiety and enuresis. Her case was inappropriately screened as routine and the referral was triaged 8 weeks later. Allison was not communicated with at this time, but her mother shared a full account of concerns with the triage psychologist. Additional concerns were raised during triage and the matter was taken to a multi-disciplinary team. The team decided that Allison should be assessed face to face. They determined the case to be low risk and placed it in the green zone. The concerns shared with the service should have resulted in a more urgent face to face assessment. The assessment of Allison took place 9 months later. This was not a face-to-face assessment, as directed by the multi-disciplinary team. There was a telephone discussion, initially with Allison's mother alone. Allison later spoke to the assessor but there was no full assessment of her mental state. There was no full exploration of the concerns raised in the referral and in the triage discussion. There was no evidence of the assessor determining the cause of Allison's worrying presentation. There was no carefully documented assessment of risk. There was no carefully devised risk management plan. A decision was made to discharge Allison from the mental health team, with no multi-disciplinary review or liaison with the referrer. Allison continued to receive counselling provided at her school, but this concluded at the end of term, on the 15 July 2022. On the 18 July 2022 Allison was found suspended in her bedroom. The failure to provide basic mental health care to Allison contributed to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced. The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern. The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country. There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams. The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor. The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10 – 12 per week. The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week. There is a concern that ongoing under resourcing of CAMHS services (whilst demand continues to increase), will result in future similar deaths. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 April 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that: on 3 June 2019, Leah Barber was found deceased at the Bolton Woods Quarry, Bolton Hall Road in Bradford. Leah was suffering a range of mental health pressures in the last 18 months of her life, and her mental health fluctuated in the terms of the nature and severity of those pressures. She had previous thoughts of taking her own life and had tried to do so on two occasions. [REDACTED] On the morning of 3 June 2019 Leah left a note at her home address for family which indicated an intent to take her own life. From the location within the quarry at which she was discovered and a post-mortem examination it was apparent that Leah had fallen from a height of around 30 metres. The evidence showed that Leah had taken her own life. The medical cause of death was: 1a. Multiple injuries with inhalation of water 1b. Fall from a height",As per box 3 (immediately above).,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) A detailed review of the evidence in this case, which included evidence from two Schools ( ), as well as from Bradford Children's Social Services, the TRACKS Education team (at Bradford Council), the SCIL Team and the Council's SEND Team, revealed that no one person or department at Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Bradford Council had an overview of Council's involvement in relation to Leah (prior to her death). Of greater concern was that that remained so after each of the Council departments involved were notified that Leah had passed away. Every organisation which had contact with the Coroner's service in relation to Leah's death, with the exception of Bradford Council, was able to provide the Court with an overview/analysis of their involvement with Leah prior to her death and (where appropriate) the lessons they had learnt as a result their involvement with Leah. The Police and the local Mental Health Trust were examples of two public bodies who had and were able to provide an overview/analysis to the Court in terms of their involvement with Leah and confirm whether there were any lessons to be learned by them. The evidence provided by witnesses from the various Bradford Council teams which were involved with Leah, showed a clear disconnect in the involvement of the various Council departments. That was not caused by those individuals who had provided written statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide oral evidence. Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actions/omissions on the part of individuals/teams within the Council which more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Leah's death, the concern is that Bradford Council appeared not to have a system/process in place which allowed anyone (whether an individual / a team) within the Council to have an overview of deaths where there had been previous Council involvement with the deceased (in this case a child). In the apparent absence of such oversight Bradford Council would not be able to learn lessons from such cases (or even know if there were lessons to be learned). The absence of such a single point of oversight as was apparent in Leah's case, contributes to the risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 th March 2023. Medical Cause of Death 1a Multiple Traumatic Injuries How, when and where and, for investigations where section 5(2) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 applies, in what circumstances the deceased came by his or her death. Shortly after 9am on 2 September 2020, Samuel Thomas Howes suffered fatal injuries when he jumped in front of a train [REDACTED] He did so in the following circumstances: a) Samuel suffered from ongoing mental health issues including anxiety and depression. b) Samuel's mental health led to his use of drugs and dependency which exacerbated his poor mental health. c) Samuel was a looked-after child, living in a placement residence. d) That he was free to, and did, leave that residence e) That early on 2 September 2020, he was recorded by police as being a 'missing person' f) That police did not succeed in finding him before he jumped in front of the train Below are also matters admitted by interested persons: a) Following Samuel's arrest on 30 August 2023, neither of the safeguarding forms (specifically, a CYP and a DASH form) was completed by officers of the British Transport Police (BTP) b) The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) did not request Samuel be assessed by healthcare professionals (in particular a Custody Nurse Practitioner or a member of the Liaison and Diversion Team) while in custody on 30-31 August 2020. c) The MPS did not progress the investigation to locate Samuel after 3:15pm on 2 September 2020 and before actions were set at 08:04am on 2 September 2020.","A jury found: Suicide Samuel's mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death. We believe that the following matters also possibly made more than minimal, trivial or negligible contributions to his death a) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the possibility of a rehabilitative placement. There were inadequate provisions for Samuel's complex needs. In particular, it was noted that no alternative treatments were proactively pursued. The agencies identified Covid as an obstacle to justify their inadequate responses. b) The failure to inadequately share risk information by Social Services and/or Mental Health Services with each other, and with the police. A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Missing risk assessments were not completed consistently • The Grab Pack was not completed • iii) Samuel's vulnerabilities and suicide notes were not adequately communicated to the police by Social Services c) The sharing of risk information by the MPS and/or BTP with partner agencies. A number of factors were noted in this regard: • There was a failure to share risk information by the MPS with BTP, as well as with partner agencies. • In particular, there was a failure to complete and update the CYP Fonns, or Merlin, as a result of each agency using their own platfonn. • In addition, the BTP did not access the PNC to identify Samuel's Warning Markers d) Steps taken by the MPS to seek an assessment of Samuel's mental health by a Liaison and Diversion Practitioner whilst he was in custody on 30 and 31 August 2020 The following was noted in this regard: • Actions noted on THRIVE regarding the provision of a mental health assessment for Samuel were not followed up on multiple occasions. e) The inadequate approach of staff and the safeguarding processes within Croydon Custody Suite A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Samuel's actions were regarded as 'attention-seeking'. • The DASH and CYP Fonns were not completed. • The limited collaboration between the MPS and BTP led to a lack of recognition of Samuel's mental health needs, resulting in inadequate care. f) Failures by multiple agencies and the inadequate response to the 'missing persons' investigation conducted by the MPS A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Failure to share infonnation by different agencies • Failure by multiple agencies to contact Samuel's family when he went missing. g) Samuel's interactions with his girlfriends The following was noted in this regard: • Samuel's relationships were described as 'chaotic' and this impacted on his mental health and his behaviour • In particular, the texts from his girlfriends telling him to 'kill himself as well as the threats by another girlfriend to end her life, had a significant impact on Samuel's behaviour.","During the course of the investigation, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN (some of which overlap) are as follows:

(1) Samuel's case should be a stimulus for some level of Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service reflection on how different Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service teams are organised and work together.

(2) The delayed response of the Adult Complex Additions Service to referral and issues related to provision of care to adolescents presenting with mental health vulnerabilities and substance use difficulties.

(3) The lack of a complex service providing, to adolescents, treatment for both substance misuse and mental health issues models, in terms of willingness to engage, being problematic for some young people.

(4) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the provision of a rehabilitative placement.

(5) Samuel's mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death."

NHS Kent and Medway integrated care board 1,"On the 8th April 2022 I opened an inquest into the death of Stefan Kluibenschadl. At the inquest, which lasted two days and heard from a few of those involved in Stefan's short life, I concluded on 1st December 2022 with a narrative conclusion “He died as a consequence of his own actions, his intention being unknown”","1. Stefan suffered from autism and was at school at Laleham gap where he had been since April 2013. He had annual reviews of his placement at the school and was doing well and at the start of the winter 2020 term had managed to obtain a part time job and was considering career options of either the army or food industry. He had an extremely supportive family and parents who made significant efforts to ensure that he had access to the support he needed. 2. Both his parents and his school noted a decline in his mental health in December 2021 and he met with the school alongside his parents and his timetable was amended and steps to obtain additional support considered. On 14th January 2022 he told a member of staff at school that he had contacted the National Suicide Prevention helpline but later appeared to deny this. He apparently did not express any intent to harm himself but did express feelings of being low. 3. His parents, having tried to see what help was available locally, took steps to try to arrange private counselling and arranged for this to start after the February half term. The service the family approached did not consider Stefan was suitable for short term counselling and advice was given to approach his General Practitioner(GP). On 15th March 2022 Stefan's Mum spoke to his GP and asked for a letter to apply for funding from specific autism related counselling which his GP did but this was rejected and the letter received on 17th March 2022. At the consultation which occurred on the telephone between Stefan's mother and his GP there was no mention of suicidal ideation or self-harm. On Sunday 20th March Stefan was found hanging at home in his bedroom by his family and he was taken to hospital and subsequently transferred to Kings College hospital where sadly he died on 26th March 2022. 4. In the course of hearing the evidence it was clear that local mental health services were considered to be accessible via a Single Point of Access and that anyone could refer in this way and the healthcare provider would then screen any referral which was made and possibly provide treatment. However such a referral was not made for Stefan because it was not clear that this was available to Stefan's family who would have taken whatever steps they could have done to ensure appropriate support. His General Practitioner was aware of the Single Point of Access and that there were groups available but waits for specific services for those with autism in her experience were at least 3 months and instead she referred him to a different service at South London and the Maudsley which she considered may better suit his needs. The referral was rejected but the correspondence on this only came to light after Stefan's sad death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. During the course of the inquest reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance “Autistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management.” Published on 28 August 2013 and in particular paragraph 1.1.4 which states that “Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with autism has a case manager or key worker to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition to adult care in line with the NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering identification and diagnosis).” Stefan did not have a case manager or key worker. 2. I am unable to say if the lack of a case manager or key worker caused or contributed more than minimally to Stefan's death but had one been available they may have been able to assist Stefan and his family to navigate the services available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a difference. I am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues where there is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroner's and Justice Act 2009 creates a duty on Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to a concern which may lead to future deaths. 3. I asked for further evidence on the provision of case managers/key workers in accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East London Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board. It is clear from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19 year olds who have both a learning disability and/or a diagnosis of autism and are at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there is a significant sudden deterioration in the community and the multi disciplinary team has not been responsive. The lowest level of service outlined in reply to the court indicated that referrals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not that they would have a key worker allocated to them. This sets the bar at a level which means a large number of young people with a learning disability and/or autism would not have a key worker nor would they be expected to have one . 4. In the evidence provided it was outlined that “Keyworkers will make sure that these children, young people and families get the right support at the right time. They will make sure that local systems are responsive to fully meeting the young people's needs in a joined-up way and that whenever it is possible to provide care and treatment in the community with the right support this becomes the norm.” If every autistic child or young person had a key worker this would enable them or their family the opportunity to liaise with their key worker rather than having to try to navigate services themselves. This, in turn, may prevent others from encountering the issues faced by Stefan's family and ultimately prevent future deaths. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28th September 2022. I concluded with a narrative conclusion of:- Jade, who was vulnerable, had been struggling with his mental health. He had been using alcohol and drugs to mask underlying issues and he had been finding it difficult to engage with services in order to address this. There were missed opportunities by a number of services to proactively engage with Jade to ensure that he was being encouraged to address his dependency on alcohol and drugs and notably the missed opportunity to carry out a child in need review when Jade was approaching 18 which did not occur due to his case being closed prematurely. Jade's death was contributed to by neglect. 4","In 2019 Jade's behaviour started to deteriorate. He dropped out of St Pauls' College and started to get involved in criminal activity. He came to the attention of Children Services, the Mental Health Service and the Police (having been the victim of assaults, being involved in domestic disputes and having been arrested for aggravated burglary). Alcohol and substance misuse played a substantive part in his lifestyle. At 22:07 on 20 May 2020 Mrs Hutchings (Jade's mother) reported to the police that Jade (who was 18 at the time) had not returned home. She said that he had left the house at 17:00 under the influence of alcohol and drugs saying that he would be back soon. He didn't return so Mrs Hutchings contacted his friends but they had not heard from him. She was Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 concerned for her son as this was out of character for him and he had previously been assaulted. The Police treated Jade as a missing person and tried to locate Jade. At 03:00 police located Jade at Hastings Town Centre. He was drunk. The Police did not detain him under Section 136 Mental Health Act as they did think it was necessary. They transported him back home to Haywards Heath. On arriving home he went to bed. When Jade woke up the following morning, he was argumentative with his mother. He eventually calmed down and apologised. Later that morning his mother and sister left the house to go to the shops. They arrived back home at about 14:00 and went upstairs where they found Jade hanging Mrs Hutchings and some of her neighbours began CPR on Jade and an ambulance arrived along with several police officers who assisted with CPR. Jade was taken to Brighton Hospital where despite treatment he died on 23rd May 2020. The Cause of death is recorded as: - 1a Hypoxic Brain Injury 1b Asphyxia due to Hanging by Hanging 21/5/20 5","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Inadequate Police training on Mental Health During the course of the Inquest officers involved in dealing with Jade (and in particular around the exercise of their Section 136 powers on 21/5/20) acknowledged that they had received very little mental health training. Some officers could not recall any additional training provided since their initial training when they first joined the force. The officers admitted that although they were aware of the Sussex Police mental health guide they had not read it in full. The expert police witness, , told the Inquest that in his view the online training provision that we were told was being rolled out in Sussex was not sufficient. None of the officers involved in this case had yet undertaken this online training. It was his opinion that officers should be provided with the nationally recognised two day training course written by the College of Policing, The course is available for all Police forces to be rolled out locally. This training had not been adopted by Sussex Police. There was also confusion amongst Officers (and a lack of clear understanding) around the provision and use of service the Haven at Millview could provide. 2. REBOOT - Lack of provision to for older age group There was clear evidence that Jade was vulnerable and had become involved in violence and crime in 2019 (the year before his death). It was believed by some that Jade exploited by gangs running county line drug operations. A need for an early intervention was identified by his social worker and a referral to Reboot was made. The Inquest was told that at the time REBOOT was prioritising 12 – 14 years children and as Jade was nearing 18 they were unable to work with him. This was a missed opportunity for Jade to be involved in a form of early intervention before his life started unravelling and he became more heavily entrenched in the world of crime. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 It is understood that at the time of Jade's death the Police and Crime Commissioner was responsible for the REBOOT scheme but at the time of writing this report the scheme is now run by Sussex Police. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The inquest started on Tuesday 11 October 2022 and concluded today, Friday 14 October 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. 4","Charley Ann Patterson Deceased suffered with low mood and anxiety related to a number of factors including the restrictions in place due to COVID-19, relationship difficulties with peers and other influences. She had suffered bullying in the period leading up to her death through electronic means. She shared two known previous instances of self-harm involving cutting to her arms which were superficial in nature. She voluntarily attended Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington with her mother at approximately 20.00 hours on 29th May 2020 after she had self-harmed for the second time a few days prior. She was assessed and promptly referred to and seen by the Psychiatric Liaison Team at approximately 21.30 hours. There · were superficial cuts to the left arm which did not require medical intervention and she wanted support with her anxiety and low self-esteem and to learn positive coping strategies for times of emotional distress due to a number of factors. As part of the discharge plan on 29 May 2020 she was referred to the Young Persons Universal Crisis Team and an assessment with them took place upon agreement via telephone on 1 June 2020. She did not meet the criteria for referral to Children and Young Peoples Service as she did not present with a significant degree of psychological dis tress or mental health difficulty. She was discharged with support netting and a plan where it was discussed and agreed with her and her mother that there would be a referral to the Northumberland (Early Help) Hub. No referral to the Northumberland (Early Help) Hub was made. There was no referral to the mental health trust saf eguarding team and there was an absence of communication 5 with other services and professionals although it is not possible to say if those referrals and steps had been undertaken whether the outcome would have been any different. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was commenced, and paramedics arrived, and a return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. She was conveyed by ambulance to Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington and upon arrival was in cardiac arrest. Despite continued attempts at resuscitation life was confirmed extinct at 19.31 hours on 1 October 2020 within Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington. Charley Ann Patterson had left a number of drawings and a note with references to the intention of ending her life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ­ (1) During the course of the inquest, it was a concern to me the increase in the number of children and young people who are now being seen with regard to their emotional well- being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them requiring support and assessment since the Coronavirus pandemic and the delays that now exist before they receive treatment and support. (2) I heard that in 2020 if the criteria for referral had been met for referral to Children's Adolescent Mental Health Services there would have been a triage of the child or young person within 8 weeks, treatment within up to 19 weeks with the number of referrals at that time being 1,595. In 2022, subject to meeting the criteria for referral, there would be a triage of the child or young person within 3 weeks but that the waiting time for treatment has increased from up to 19 weeks to up to 63 weeks with the number of referrals being 2,275. (3) I heard evidence from Cramlington Learning Village where Charley was a pupil and they told me since Charley's death they have strengthened their support for children suffering from anxiety and other mental health issues by increasing the mental health learn, employing two emotional literacy teaching assistants, a Mental Health and Well Being Practitioner, another Thrive Practitioner and increased the number of Deputy Safeguarding Leads to 5. (4) I heard from a Paediatric Nurse Practitioner who is based in the Accident and Emergency at Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington who told me in evidence that in 2020 it was the case that she would see a referral from a child or young person struggling with emotional distress, anxiety, mental health difficulties and instances of self-harm and overdose once a week but that since the Coronavirus pandemic the incidence of assessments for children and young people with those issues has risen from once per week to once per shift. I also heard from the Group Nurse Director forCumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust in the North Locality who told me that in May 2020 she would see 100 referrals a month from children experiencing anxiety and mental health difficulties but in May 2022 the number of referrals has increased to 300 children per month. The reason for the referrals is complex but includes the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic with staff seeing an increase in demand in the numbers of young people suffering with anxiety, low self-esteem, bod image, OCD and instances of self-harm and overdose. (5) I ask for there to be an assessment of the services and resources that can be offered to meet the increase in demand in the number of children and young people seeking support with regard to their emotional well-being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them since the Coronavirus pandemic and to reduce the delay in receiving early support in order to avoid a mental health crisis. 6"

I opened an inquest on the 1st December 2017. The inquest concluded on the 30th September 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was “Molly Rose Russell died from an act of self-harm whilst suffering from depression and the negative effects of on-line content”. The medical cause of death was 1a Suspension. 4","Molly Rose Russell was found having hanged herself on the Twenty- First of November 2017. Molly was 14 years old. Molly appeared a normal healthy girl who was flourishing at school, having settled well into secondary school life and displayed an enthusiastic interest in the Performing Arts. However, Molly had become depressed, a common condition affecting children of this age. This then worsened into a depressive illness. Molly subscribed to a number of online sites. At the time that these sites were viewed by Molly some of these sites were not safe as they allowed access to adult content that should not have been available for a 14-year-old child to see. The way that the platforms operated meant that Molly had access to images, video clips and text concerning or concerned with self-harm, suicide or that were otherwise negative or depressing in nature. The platform operated in such a way using algorithms as to result, in some circumstances, of binge periods of images, video clips and text some of which were selected and provided without Molly requesting them. These binge periods, if involving this content are likely to have had a negative effect on Molly. Some of this content romanticised acts of self- harm by young people on themselves. Other content sought to isolate and discourage discussion with those who may have been able to help. Molly turned to celebrities for help not realising there was little prospect of a reply. In some cases, the content was particularly graphic, tending to portray self- harm and suicide as an inevitable consequence of a condition that could not be recovered from. The sites normalised her condition focusing on a limited and irrational view without any counterbalance of normality. It is likely that the above material viewed by Molly, already suffering with a depressive illness and vulnerable due to her age, affected her mental health in a negative way and contributed to her death in a more than minimal way. 5","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The following matters were raised during the Inquest:- 1. There was no separation between adult and child parts of the platforms or separate platforms for children and adults. 2. There was no age verification when signing up to the on-line platform. 3. That the content was not controlled so as to be age specific. 4. That algorithms were used to provide content together with adverts. 5. That the parent, guardian or carer did not have access, to the material being viewed or any control over that material. 6. That the child's account was not capable of being separately linked to the parent, guardian or carer's account for monitoring. I recommend that consideration is given by the Government to reviewing the provision of internet platforms to children, with reference to harmful on-line content, separate platforms for adults and children, verification of age before joining the platform, provision of age specific content, the use of algorithms to provide content, the use of advertising and parental guardian or carer control including access to material viewed by a child, and retention of material viewed by a child. I recommend that consideration is given to the setting up of an independent regulatory body to monitor on-line platform content with particular regard to the above. I recommend that consideration is given to enacting such legislation as may be necessary to ensure the protection of children from the effects of harmful on-line content and the effective regulation of harmful on-line content. Although regulation would be a matter for Government I can see no reason why the platforms themselves would not wish to give consideration to self-regulation taking into account the matters raised above. 6"

Cygnet Health Care 2. NHS England 1,"On 19 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney born on 11 September 2003. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which commenced on 7 March 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was:- On the 10th of April 2021 in Cygnet Hospital, Sheffield, Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney performed an act of self-harm by tying 2 non-fixed ligatures. As a result of insufficient care, crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response, this led to her unexpected death two days later on the 12th of April in the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield. There was also a jury questionnaire which was completed and is appended to this Regulation 28 report for information. The medical cause of death was: 1a: Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 4","Mental Health Overview It is clear from the evidence that was heard during the inquest that Chelsea initially developed a type of eating disorder that required support. She was admitted to a number of mental health inpatient units leading to her admission to Cygnet in Sheffield. Whilst in this facility a number of material things happened:- 1. Chelsea began to self-harm using ligatures which was a new behaviour 2. Chelsea's working diagnosis became PTSD 3. Chelsea made a number of allegations of abuse by members of her family and others which required investigating 2 4. Chelsea declined to share information with her family Chelsea's family were advised that young people are not given a fixed diagnosis and that the working diagnosis was PTSD. Chelsea's family were keen to explore a diagnosis of autism however despite there not being a fixed diagnosis for Chelsea this was not explored by the treating team and Chelsea's diagnosis of PTSD does not appear to have been routinely reviewed through her admission. To be clear; I mean that her diagnosis was not reviewed, not that her treatment and plans were not reviewed. There also seems to have been a move away from a diagnosis of an eating disorder and following the inquest I am not clear that I understand the rationale for this other than PTSD appeared to be a better 'fit' for Chelsea's symptoms. Ligatures Chelsea started to use ligatures in Cygnet having not done so previously. Again, this does not appear to have been a cause of significant concern and appears to be the norm within Chelsea's peer cohort. There was one particular issue for Chelsea however which came to light during the inquest which was that male members of staff felt concerned about interacting with Chelsea alone: even where that delayed support in risky situations. Engagement with Chelsea's Family I heard evidence that there came a time when Chelsea did not which for her parents to be aware of what was happening in Cygnet or have any information about her health and that she had capacity to make this decision. I have subsequently received the Capacity Assessment that supports this view. I also heard in evidence that the Capacity Assessment ought to have been revisited and that there were circumstances when a patient's wishes could not be respected. This was particularly relevant to Chelsea's mother having limited information and then supporting her on s17 leave. I also heard that Chelsea was supported by a legal advisor for the purposes of her detention under the Mental Health Act. I also heard no evidence that her age was considered and whether or not she was competent to make this decision even if she had capacity. Chelsea was 17 at the time of her death; this required careful exploration with her and there was no evidence of this. Emergency Response on the Day of the Final Ligature Incident I heard evidence that the check on Chelsea was delayed due to another emergency on the unit, namely the tying of a ligature by another individual. I also heard evidence that the timing of Chelsea's checks were not in accordance with recognised policy and ought perhaps to have prompted a different review and approval process (although the timings were appropriate and designed to keep Chelsea safe). I heard evidence, and the jury expressly accepted, that the alarm being pulled for the other patient using a ligature would be heard by Chelsea and was a relevant factor in her ligature event. I then heard that when she was checked the member of staff who checked on her would not lay hands on her as he was a male member of staff alone in the room and was worried about repercussions. He therefore sought support from a female member of staff who went to check on Chelsea and realised that she was not conscious. She then shouted for help and a ligature knife. There were then further delays as others came to observe Chelsea, collected the ligature knife, and removed the ligature then commenced CPR with the red bag. The jury found that these delays were unreasonable in the circumstances. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence about the co-ordination of CPR was that every member of staff present believed one individual was leading the CPR response; however, that particular individual was not aware of that. Whilst this did not materially change the CPR in this case it was certainly not indicative of a well- 3 rehearsed and practiced response to an emergency situation. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: – 1. The diagnosis whilst described as not being fixed; was not adequately reviewed. The primary witness for Cygnet in relation to diagnosis lacked professional curiosity even when asked questions in evidence. For example dismissing the potential that Chelsea may be hyperbolic in some of her descriptions of incidents and could that be relevant to diagnosis or treatment; evidence from the family about another member of the family with an autism diagnosis was not followed up (the evidence from Cygnet being that they had not been aware the family wished to explore this); nonetheless in evidence it was dismissed as a possibility. 2. Whilst it is important that the young person is believed and has confidence in those with a therapeutic relationship that she will be believed when she makes disclosures; there was almost no professional curiosity about the allegations and whether they spoke to something else going on with Chelsea. The allegations that were made were blindly accepted by the team and one example where this was problematic is that part of Chelsea's PTSD diagnosis was based on flashbacks. One of the flashbacks which she described related to finding her aunt dead. Her Aunt was not dead and in fact attended the inquest proceedings however this had not been clarified with the family and the treating team accepted this information from Chelsea unequivocally. It is clear there is a very fine balance to tread as it is clear that Chelsea was suffering from flashbacks and had suffered trauma, there was no demonstrable exploration of this. 3. The decision not to share information with family was made based on one capacity assessment. This did not fully address the issues with Chelsea of understanding the consequences of that decision and neither does it adequately break down the information which Cygnet may wish to share with family. This appears to have been a blanket decision and once a capacity assessment determined that Chelsea had the capacity to make that decision there is not evidence available to me of conversations with Chelsea to establish exactly what she would and would not share with family and that the consequences of those decisions were adequately explored with her. I would have expected; at Chelsea's age, that a social worker would be involved in supporting her with this decision and reviewing it regularly. This decision about her capacity and information sharing were also not revisited which they ought to have been regularly. Not least because Chelsea's mother was responsible for supporting her with s17 leave and was entitled to fully understand the risks to Chelsea or herself through this. 4. There was no evidence of debrief after prior incidents of ligatures or other self- harm attempts and therefore crucial information about Chelsea's state of mind, motivation and methods was missing from future planning and risk assessments. 5. There was limited concern about the number of ligature incidents collectively across the ward. They appear to have been accepted as normal behaviour. There was no record of Chelsea using ligatures prior to her admission onto this ward. This reality for staff appears to have led to a downgrading of the seriousness of the use of ligatures. With staff describing in evidence when they would and would not intervene and what would and would not constitute a serious incident in relation to ligatures (i.e., a hospital admission would be required before it was regarded as a serious incident requiring immediate changes to risk levels and observations). It may be that this approach to ligatures also contributed to the delay in Chelsea's final ligature being removed. 4 6. Male staff were nervous and uncertain of how to approach Chelsea when they were alone. Clear guidance needed to be made available to them on how to deal with this. Although in evidence staff said that if there was an emergency they would attend even if alone this was not the case in practice as the male member of staff sought female support before recognising that Chelsea was in crisis. 7. The approach of three members of staff checking Chelsea before the ligature knife was brought and used led to avoidable delay. I am aware from the evidence that there are practice exercises involving the 'Red Bag' however I am not clear that the same is practised in relation to the check, identification of a ligature and obtaining and using the ligature knife in these situations. 8. Whilst in evidence I have heard about the practice exercises using the 'Red Bag' it is clear that there was limited confidence and clarity around the CPR needed for Chelsea. There was not a clear structure of one person leading and others knowing exactly what and how to do tasks. 9. There were opportunities for commissioners to support Cygnet earlier when case managing Chelsea's package of care. The new behaviour of using ligatures should have invited professional curiosity from Commissioners who should have sought assurance about the overall practice of ligature use and intervention from Cygnet but also what that meant specifically for Chelsea and how Cygnet were keeping her safe. This may have led to a review by Cygnet and a better understanding of Chelsea's ligature use. 10. Commissioners also ought to have spoken to Chelsea themselves and assured themselves about the decision not to share information with her family; particularly her mother who had been a huge support for Chelsea prior to Covid- 19. The impact of the cessation of face-to-face visits on anyone detained under the mental health act, but particularly young people like Chelsea appears to have been underestimated. 6"

Lily was 17 years old when she passed away on the 1st June 2019. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 9th August 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion: 1 Lily Girton took her own life whilst suffering from a mental illness. Her death was contributed to by a failure of the community CAMHS team to expedite an assessment by a psychiatrist; to carefully and robustly assess and manage her risk to self and by a failure to titrate up her anti-depressant medication to an effective dose. 4,"Lily Girton suffered from anxiety, depression and emotional dysregulation . She sought assistance from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in December 2018. She was asked to register with a new GP before she could access the service. On 12 March 2019 she was seen for her first assessment with the team . Later the same day, Lily presented in distress at Euston station and required detention under section 136 of the MHA for her own safety. She was taken to University College Hospital where she was admitted to a paediatric ward and where she received care from the psychiatric liaison team . Following this brief admission , Lily was prescribed antidepressants by her GP who expected the community CAMHS team to continue monitoring and prescribing this medication . The community team did not do this and Lily was not seen by a psychiatrist within the community CAMHS Team . Lily was seen by a social worker within the CAM HS team , who had been appointed as her care co-ordinator. The care co­ ordinator provided cognitive behavioural therapy . She did not take steps to expedite the psychiatric appointment; did not take steps to ensure that Lily's medication was appropriately titrated and did not carefully assess, document and communicate Lily's risk to self. On the 29 April 2019, Lily was admitted to University Hospital again , requiring a longer admission and presenting with higher risk. The concerns of the hospital team were communicated to the community CAMHS teams, but Lily's care plan was not materially altered. On the 31 May 2019, Lily was involved in an altercation with a group of males in a kebab shop. She was mocked by the males and she reported that one of the males had hit her. In the early hours of the 1 June 2019, Lily was discovered partner's home address. Her life was pronounced extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. The altercation in the kebab shop is likely to have contributed to a decline in Lily's mental state on the 31 May 2019. The failings in the care provided to her by the community CAM HS team left Lily without the resilience to manage the decline in her mental state. 5 CORONE~SCONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern . In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken . In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you . The MATTERS OF CONCERN are",". - The Inquest heard that CAMHS services nationally have a lack of adequate staffing levels in the form of doctors, in the form of psychiatrists, registered mental health nurses and psychotherapy staff. The Inquest heard that consultants often have an average of 130 to 150 active cases on their caseloads . This is substantially higher than the recommended caseloads by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The lack of staffing and resources contributed to Lily's death and there is a concern that the ongoing shortages of suitably trained staff within CAM HS teams poses a risk of future deaths of young people. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 June 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Robyn took her own life whilst struggling with her mental health. The mental health services failed Robyn as they did not recognise the deterioration of her mental health nor provide her with the care and treatment she required. Her death was contributed to by neglect. 4,"On 7th May 2021 Robyn Skilton was found in Southwater Park, having tied a ligature around her neck. Emergency services were called but death was confirmed at 1251 hrs. Robyn had a history of mental health problems which included self harming. Despite her deteriorating mental health, at the time of her death, she was still awaiting a formal assessment by a Child Psychiatrist. 5","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Robyn was failed by the Mental Health Services quite frankly due to the current lack of resourcing and provision in place to support young people struggling with their mental health. Due to the lack of availability of a Child Psychiatrist there are long waiting times for children to be assessed. Robyn was not seen by a Child Psychiatrist and/or Psychologist, despite there being a need for this to happen, thereby enabling her to be diagnosed and receive a treatment plan. Robyn's parents did everything they could during this period to support Robyn, including paying for a private counsellor, but sadly Robyn's mental health continued to deteriorate during this time, and she took her own life. Robyn initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) similarly did not happen in a timely manner. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 I do appreciate that the landscape that the local mental health Trust (Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust) was working under and the fact that Covid heightened the level of complexity across many services but there were many failings in the care provided to Robyn. It became very clear during the Inquest that there is significant under funding of the local mental health Trust who like many mental health Trusts have seen an explosion of referrals to their Children and Mental Health services (CAMHS). By way of an example:- Referrals to West Sussex CAMHS have increased by 95.6% from May 2019 (389) to May 2022 (761) West Sussex CAMHS caseload has increased by 85% from May 2019 (2239) to May 2022 (4147) West Sussex CAMHS Duty caseload has increased by 112% from May 2021 (492) to May 2022 (1494) Mental Health A&E presentations, in period April 2021 - March 2022, have increased by 40% on previous year (April 2020 - March 2021). Additionally, across Sussex CAMHS, as a whole, the referrals data shows:- • May 2022 was the highest number of referrals the service has ever received (1350). • Of those 1350 referrals, 80% (1,081) were accepted into the service. • In comparison, in May 2019, 579 were accepted (65% accepted) • So, an additional 502 young people have been accepted in May 2022 compared to May 2019 Despite the increase in numbers accessing CAMHS there has not been any relative increase in resources to meet this demand and therefore the current position is is unsustainable and it is putting many young people's lives at risk. 6"

Royal College of Psychiatrists, 21 Prescot Street, London, E1 8BB 2. Secretary of State for Health, The Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP, 39 Victoria Street London, SW1 H 0EU",3 On the 7th July 2022 I concluded the Inquest into the death of Stanislav Mucha who died on the 3rd February 2021 at Salford Royal Hospital. The medical cause of death was recorded as : 1a) Polytrauma The conclusion was a narrative conclusion - Died as a result of catastrophic injuries sustained after he jumped from the at the Rock centre in Bury. There was no evidence of his intention and he had a history of psychosis.,"4 Stanislav was 17 years old when he died on the 3rd February 2022. In concerns had been raised about his mental health and he was admitted as an inpatient. He was diagnosed with acute on-set psychosis. He was discharged from hospital in May 2020 and his care was passed to the Early Intervention team. Stanislav presented as a high risk to others. He travelled to Slovakia with his family in September 2020 and he returned in January 2021 . At this time there had been a clear deterioration in his mental health. There are repeated attempts to engage him and referrals for a mental health act assessment. On the 22nd January the court heard that a mental health act assessment was attempted at the home address. In attendance was a Section 12 approved independent psychiatrist, a Consultant Psychiatrist from the treating trust, the Approved Mental Health Practitioner and a professional who was involved in sourcing a bed for Stanislav. All members of this group gave evidence to the court as to what they understood had occurred on this day. There was a difference in opinion as to whether :­ a) A mental health act assessment had been conducted. The psychiatrists were of the opinion due to the brevity of time in which Stanislav was observed, merely walking past them into the house, an assessment was not done. This was at odds with the AMP who believed an assessment had been conducted. b) The next steps which were to be taken. Three of the professionals understood an application to the Magistrates court for a Section 135 warrant to allow entry into the property. This was not the understanding of the AMP who did not progress this action, having formed the opinion an assessment had in fact taken place. The Court heard evidence the Psychiatrists were expecting a further attempt to conduct an assessment later that day or the next day. On the 26th January 2021 Stanislav's treating Consultant Psychiatrist became aware of the outcome of the mental health act assessment. Due to ongoing concerns in relation to Stanislavs mental health a further mental health act assessment was arranged for the 3rd February 2021 . Stanislav jumoed of the 3rd February 2021. 5 CORONE~SCONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are",:­ 1. The Independent Section 12 Consultant Psychiatrist did not make and the court heard does not have the facilities to make any notes in relation to the assessment. 2. Following the assessment on the 22nd January 2021 there was no documented agreement as to the outcome of the assessment between all professionals. This would have negated the confusion and lack of understanding as to what had occurred and the actions required. 3. 6

The investigation concluded on the 8th April 2022 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from suicide contributed to by a failure by mental health services to recognise her deteriorating mental health and the increased risk she presented and to take effective steps to reduce the risk. The medical cause of death was 1a Multi organ Failure; 1b Hypoxic Brain Injury;1c Asphyxiation on background of gabapentin toxicity 4,"Laura Jane Medcalf managed her mental health through exercise and controlling her food intake. The onset of Covid-19 restrictions and surgical interventions for her hydrocephalus meant that the routine she had relied on to manage her mental health was not available to her. On 3rd December 2020 after considering taking her own life for a number of weeks Laura Jane Medcalf took an overdose of paracetamol. She was taken to Salford Royal Hospital after she told her family what she had done. On 4th December 2020 she was assessed as requiring a mental health bed. She consented to a mental health in-patient stay but would have been sectioned had she not consented. Shortage of mental health beds meant she was kept at Salford Royal Hospital until moving to a bed on the Medlock Ward on 10th December 2020. She was discharged on 16th December 2020. On 17th December 2020 she was assessed by the home-based treatment team who identified she needed to be re-admitted to the Medlock Ward. Whilst waiting for a bed she went to went to hospital due to concerns about keeping herself safe. She was readmitted to the Medlock Ward as a voluntary patient. She continued to be prescribed medication including gabapentin. She had disclosed that the discomfort from that neurosurgery had impacted her mental health. There was a failure to follow up a referral to the neuro team, this did not contribute to her death. On 16th January 2021 she told staff on the ward she had taken a paracetamol 2 overdose and drunk vodka whilst on the ward. She was taken to hospital for treatment. On 22nd January 2021 she returned to the Medlock ward. On 31st January 2021 she was found in her bed with a There was a failure to complete a Datix incident form in compliance with trust policy. On the afternoon of 9th February 2021, she was found in bed in her room with a . She remained on level 3 observations and her room was searched. A risk assessment completed on 9th February recorded this incident but failed to analyse or explore how this impacted her risk. On the evening of 9th February about 8pm there was a further incident when she was found on checks by staff in her bed with a . Her room was not searched. She was moved to level 2 observations but there was a failure to follow the trust policy in how these observations were implemented or subsequently stopped. On a check approximately 10 minutes later on 9th February 2021 she was again found with a . Her rom was searched again. There was a failure to record these in a risk assessment or to adequately assess how the three incidents reflected a deterioration in her mental health and impacted on the risk she presented or how to mitigate further the risk of carrier bags. On 14th and 15th February 2021, she was declining food according to the food charts. This was not recognised as a potential symptom that could reflect a deterioration in her mental health. On 14th February 2021 she told staff that she had had a day of bad thoughts. There was a failure to explore this or to assess If this presented an increased risk. On 15th February 2021 she told staff she had had a bad day. There was a failure to link this to the disclosure of 14th February, to then explore this disclosure with her or to re-assess the risk she presented. On 17th February 2021 on a level 3 check at about 12:10 am Laura Jane Medcalf was found in her bed in her room with a Attempts were made to resuscitate her and she was transferred to Manchester Royal Infirmary. She died there on 17th February 2021. A post-mortem examination included toxicology. It was found that she had an above therapeutic level of gabapentin in her system. Staff on the ward had failed to identify that she had possession of gabapentin in her room. She had died from a hypoxic brain injury caused by asphyxiation on a background of gabapentin toxicity. A search of her room by GMP also found a in her bedside table and a in her dressing gown that staff had not realised she had possession of. 5",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest heard that Laura Medcalf was kept in an acute hospital setting at Salford Royal Hospital awaiting a mental health bed due to a shortage of mental 3 health beds. The inquest heard that there is a national shortage of inpatient beds and that this delay is not unusual. 2. The inquest heard that during the period of time that Laura Medcalf was an in- patient on a mental health ward there were significant staffing challenges. Those challenges were part of a national picture of availability of mental health staff. Against this background and in order to keep the ward staffed and fully operational the trust had to move staff from other mental health services; use agency/bank staff and use leadership and management staff to backfill for nursing staff. 3. The evidence before the inquest was that Covid 19 and the measures to deal with it had had a significant impact in a number of respects. In particular that included the impact of lockdown on the mental health of Laura Jane Medcalf. 6

Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust 2. Cambridgeshire County Council 1,"On 8 April 2020 the coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Daniel France, age 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 January 2022. Danny was 17 years old and was living at a YMCA hostel. He was on medication for depression and had been referred to secondary mental health services. He had made previous suicide attempts. On 3 April 2020 he of his accommodation with the intention of taking his own life. The medical cause of death was asphyxiation by hanging and the conclusion was suicide. 4","Danny was a vulnerable teenager: he had left home and was living in hostel accommodation; he had changed his GP practice; he was trans, had changed his name and had been referred to the Gender Identity Clinic; he had recently been discharged from secondary mental health services in Suffolk and had been referred to mental health services in Cambridge; he had previously been under CAMHS and was now being referred to adult mental health services; he had diagnoses of anxiety and depression and had been prescribed medication; he had made previous suicide attempts and had long term suicidal thoughts; he had sought counselling from IAPT but this was declined because he was considered too high risk; he had been assessed by First Response Service but had been considered as not requiring urgent intervention. Safeguarding referrals about Danny were made to Cambridgeshire County Council in October 2019 and January 2020. Both referrals were closed and it was accepted that the decision to close both referrals was incorrect. In December 2019 Danny's new GP referred him to Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT). He had been seen by the Primary Care Mental Health Services but was still awaiting assessment by the Adult Locality Team at the time of his death. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – My concern in this case is that a vulnerable young person can be known to the County Council and Mental Health Trust and yet not receive the support they need pending substantive treatment. Danny was repeatedly assessed as not meeting the criteria for urgent intervention and yet the waiting list for psychological therapy was likely to be over a year from point of first presentation. That gap between urgent and non-urgent services is potentially dangerous for a vulnerable young person, where there is a chronic risk of an impulsive act. I understand that there is a long term plan to extend young people's services to age 25, but I remain concerned about the ongoing situation, and that a young person today could be faced with the same challenges in finding support pending substantive treatment. I believe this concern is the combined responsibility of Cambridgeshire County Council and CPFT. These organisations may wish to consult in preparing their response to this report. The inquest heard evidence about the considerable delay in obtaining appointments for the Gender Identity Clinic, and about the shortage of availability for psychological therapies such as CBT. These are matters for policy and funding. This report will therefore be copied to NHS England and The Secretary of State for Health for information purposes only. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 January 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows Medical cause of death: 1(a) Hanging The four questions - who, when, where and how – were answered as follows: Jake Adam CAHILL died on 14 September 2020 at Cornwall by being an impulsive act in a moment of crisis, that was wholly unexpected and could not have been anticipated. Short form conclusion: Suicide 4","Jake had been subject to police investigations for a minor criminal offence committed in March 2020. The police issued a conditional caution which was administered on 4 September 2020. Jake was clearly upset at being issued with a police caution and having conditions imposed. Subsequently the local youth 2 Information Classification: CONTROLLED offender service (YOS) sent Jake's mother, , some documents for completion. This included a self-assessment form, being a document produced by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales. The letter from the YOS instructed to pass that self-assessment form to Jake for completion. handed this form to Jake late in the evening of 13 September. The form was written in the first person and three questions were highlighted at Inquest, with a yes/no box for completion • I have thought about hurting myself • I have tried to hurt myself • I have thought about killing myself Jake ticked 'no' for each of these questions. The following day Jake took his own life. In connection with the self-assessment form there was no evidence of any consideration being given to the need for sensitive questions raised in the form to be discussed with Jake by a professional before Jake completed the form. Evidence was taken from police on the subject of the risk assessment forms used by police. These forms do include questions whether an individual intends to harm or kill themselves. This form is never sent to individuals but is always completed by the individual with an officer present, that officer being required to explain and if necessary, contextualise the questions. The court heard that the guidance to the self-assessment form issued by the Youth Justice Board makes no express reference to the need for consideration to be given and documented as to whether the self-assessment form needs to be discussed with a vulnerable young person before completion of the form. The guidance examined at the Inquest was a document entitled 'AssetPlus guidance v2.0'. Jake had no history of any mental health conditions, or any history of self-harm or suicidal ideation. There was no evidence from friends and family of any warning sign as to Jake's state of mind. Toxicological examination was negative, in other words no drugs or alcohol were found in samples of blood taken from Jake after death. The police investigation had searched through Jake's browsing history. That enquiry revealed nothing of concern until the day of Jake's death 14 September 2020, by way of image caches captured on his browsing history",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The inquest concluded on the 10th September 2021 when I found that the medical cause of death was - Ia Multiple Traumatic Injuries and my conclusion as to the death was that - Oskar Nash died as a result of Suicide contributed to by neglect on the part of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. Oskar Nash's death was more than minimally contributed to by the failures of : (i) Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service : To undertake a clinical assessment of Oskar's mental and emotional health at any stage, despite a series of requests for them to do so, and a consequential failure to diagnose, treat, monitor and otherwise support Oskar as necessary, in order to minimise his risk of suicide. (ii) Surrey County Council's Special Educational Needs Department : (a) To ensure that Oskar's Educational, Health and Care Plan contained sufficient and updated information about his mental and emotional health needs and his risk of suicidal ideation, and the provision required to meet those needs, and (b) To place Oskar in an appropriate school, rather than in March 2019 his inappropriate placement in a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs. (iii) Surrey County Council's Children's Services Department and Targeted Youth Support Team : (a) To complete the required assessments following Oskar's referral in November 2019, and to provide any effective intervention or support, and (b) To reallocate the management of his case to a Registered Social Worker following escalation of Oskar's risk level in the course of November 2019. (iv) St. Dominic's School and Cobham Free School : To ensure that there was a sufficient sharing of information about Oskar's history, special needs and current situation, prior to his transfer from a special needs school to a mainstream school in March 2019. I subsequently held a hearing to receive evidence relating to the prevention of future deaths and this was concluded on the 7th December 2021, with time allowed subsequently for written submissions. 4","Oskar Nash was 14 years old when he died. He had been diagnosed with autism at the age of 4 years and he suffered associated high anxiety throughout his life. It is likely that he also had one or more undiagnosed emotional or mental health condition(s). Oskar had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both of which receded when his needs were sufficiently supported. Oskar was well known to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service and to Children's Services, having been the subject of a number of referrals to both. His education was managed by the Special Educational Needs Department of his local authority as he had been issued with an Educational, Health and Care Plan. All state agencies concerned with Oskar had knowledge of his history of suicidal ideation. In March 2019 Oskar transferred from a special needs school to a mainstream school. Initially he appeared to cope, but from early November 2019 onwards, he regularly refused to attend school and a period of escalating risk followed. Referrals were made to CAMHS and Children's Services but Oskar did not receive any effective support. On the 9th January 2020, Oskar Nash gained access to an area of and, a short time later, at about 17.06 hours, he deliberately moved . His body was found the following morning. Full details of the events and failings which lead to Oskar Nash's death are set out in my “Factual Findings and Conclusions” document, a copy of which is sent with this report. 5","The evidence heard at the inquest revealed many matters giving rise to concern. The evidence received at the prevention of future deaths hearing showed that many of those concerns have been addressed. However, in my opinion the following concerns remain and give rise to a continuing risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows : A. Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Concern 1 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff responsible for the triage of referrals to child mental health services had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I have been told that the triaging process is now undertaken by an “Access and Advice Team” but I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff in that Team to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 2 The evidence at the inquest revealed that, despite a series of referrals to child mental health services over many years, Oskar Nash never received the clinical assessment he needed. I have been told that the system now in place ought to result in a child such as Oskar being seen and assessed by a clinical team. I am satisfied that the introduction of the Access and Advice Team, in the context of the new Mindworks service, is intended to ensure that a referred child's needs are properly identified and met. However, on the basis of the evidence I heard at the prevention of future deaths hearing, including from a special needs school which has experience of referring its pupils, I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that some referrals may be inappropriately closed (for example because the child, at an early stage, declines to engage) or inappropriately referred to non-clinical partner agencies. In this context, I am concerned that there is a lack of specific monitoring of what proportion of referred children reach a clinical team and the extent to which the outcomes match the expectations of the referrers (so that any ongoing “barriers” in the system, which may be preventing proper access to the clinical teams, can then be identified and eliminated). Concern 3 The evidence showed that a referral to the child mental health services is triaged initially as being crisis, urgent, priority or routine. The criteria for crisis, urgent and priority referrals are specific and narrow and, consequently, the great majority of referrals are categorised as routine. I have been told that the routine referrals are automatically categorised as “low risk”. I am concerned about this as it is clear from the evidence that a child may not meet the criteria crisis, urgent or priority but, like Oskar Nash, may nevertheless be at a high or medium risk of harm. The Trust is currently receiving a high volume of referrals and so there is a considerable waiting time for its “routine” cases to be addressed. It seems inevitable, therefore, that there are children in this category who have been wrongly assumed to be at low risk of harm but who, in fact, face a high risk of harm which is currently unrecognised and unmanaged. Concern 4 I was told that the Standard Operating Procedure manual for the triage of referrals to children's mental health services is to be updated to reflect the Trust's new working practices but that this has not yet been done. I am concerned that important changes to the system of work (for example, the vital requirement that a referred child's records are reviewed before any triaging decision is made and the child/family are spoken to) are not yet established in written guidance. Concern 5 The evidence at the inquest showed that the clinicians who were responsible for ensuring that Oskar Nash's medical conditions, including his risk of self-harm and suicide, and his consequential needs, were properly and sufficiently recorded in his Education, Health and Care Plan, failed to do so; this was in part because they did not fully understand their role and obligations in this regard. On the basis of the evidence at the prevention of future deaths hearing, I am concerned that there continues to be a lack of understanding amongst the clinicians currently providing medical advice as part of the EHCP process as to their role in that process. I am further concerned that there is in place no programme for the training or monitoring of these clinicians in relation to these responsibilities. B. Surrey County Council (and National) (i) Education and Special Educational Needs Department Concern 6 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in the Education / SEN Department, including SEN caseworkers, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 7 The evidence at the inquest showed that, in the months before his death, Oskar Nash was moved from a special needs school and placed into a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs. I found that the inappropriate placement, by SCC, of Oskar into the mainstream school contributed to his death. Prior to the placement, the mainstream school had been provided with Oskar's Educational, Health and Care Plan, but this failed adequately to identify and record his mental and emotional health concerns, his risk of suicidal ideation, his consequential needs, and the provision required to meet those needs, and it had not been updated to reflect a series of subsequent reviews of the Plan and significant subsequent events. The mainstream school was not provided with any of the extensive and informative records from the special needs school from which he was being moved. I was told by the mainstream school that, had they seen the records held by his special needs school, they would have recognised their inability to meet his needs and informed the SEN Department accordingly. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that it continues to be the case that a prospective school will usually be provided by the SEN Department with the child's EHCP only. Further, it was apparent that there is a lack of clarity as to the extent to which a current school may or should provide records or information to a prospective school. I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that placements of children with EHCPs are being made on the basis of inadequate information and record sharing. On the evidence before me, it was clear that, even if an EHCP were comprehensive and fully updated (which may not be the case), it is unlikely to contain all matters of relevance to the question of a prospective school's ability to meet the child's needs. I was given no good reason why fuller information and record sharing, sufficient to ensure that the prospective school can properly assess its ability to meet the child's needs, should not take place before any child with an EHCP is placed in a new school. I am concerned that there is no system in place, locally or nationally, to ensure this is achieved by the relevant SEN department for every child with an EHCP. I am also concerned that there is an ongoing lack of clarity as to schools' powers and duties to share information and documents, and any data protection ramifications this may have. (ii) Children's Services Department Concern 8 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in SCC's Children's Services Department, including Social Workers and other Team members, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self- harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 9 At the inquest I found that following Oskar Nash's final referral to SCC's Children's Services Department, which was made approximately two months before his death, there was a failure to appreciate the seriousness of his situation and the risks arising, and a consequential failure to allocate his case appropriately. I found that this contributed to his death. The inappropriate allocation resulted, in part, from the application of SCC's then “threshold of needs” document, which was used to inform the level at which support should be provided. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence about SCC's revised “threshold of needs” document, as well as the recent guidance (including a “toolbox”) in relation to suicidality, which has been introduced since Oskar's death. Despite these changes, I remain concerned that the “threshold of needs” document does not adequately and clearly reflect the known risks of mental health difficulties, self-harm, and suicidal ideation for autistic children (given their prevalence in this group of children) and that, consequentially, there is an ongoing risk that an autistic child in these circumstances will be allocated an insufficient level of support, as was the case for Oskar. C. Surrey County Council and Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group (and National) Concern 10 At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence concerning the post- death reviews conducted into Oskar Nash's death by the Surrey Child Death Review Partnership Team and the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership. The evidence showed that neither process resulted in a sufficient or effective investigation of the death; I consider that the evidence shows that fact finding was superficial, there was no meaningful analysis of the part played by statutory agencies in the causation of his death, and only very limited learning was identified. Ineffective review by the child death review processes results in the risk of further deaths in similar circumstances and I am concerned that the local and/or national process, guidance and oversight are insufficient to ensure that an effective post- death investigation, which should not be dependent on the inquest process, is achieved in all cases. D. National Issues Concern 11 From the evidence I heard at the inquest and the prevention of future deaths hearing, it was apparent that the national “Working Together” guidance focuses on children who are in need of safeguarding by reason of risks within the home or from other parental failures to keep the child safe. It was apparent that the consequential approach tends to look critically at the child's family and parent(s) and their parenting skills, and that this is likely to be inappropriate if the child is in need through disability. I consider that this had a detrimental impact on the approach of agencies to Oskar and his family. I am concerned that “Working Together” does not provide clearer guidance specifically for the safeguarding of children with disabilities, including Autism, and the approach to be taken by agencies to parents and families. Concern 12 The evidence at the inquest revealed a widespread lack of knowledge and understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self- harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. There was a lack of training across all the state agencies from which I heard. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence of more training being available, but also of an ongoing absence of comprehensive, relevant and mandatory training. I was told that the National Autism Strategy does not currently include a timetabled commitment for relevant mandatory Autism training to be provided to all state agencies working directly with autistic adults and children.

The Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I conducted on 17th – 28th January 2022. The conclusion was a narrative conclusion and the medical cause of death was 1a. Hanging. 2. Depression 4,"These were recorded as :- Manon Edie Jones, aged 16, suffered depression and emotional dysregulation. Her behaviour was impulsive and she had a significant history of self harm. Her mental health deteriorated from late February 2018 when she concealed an overdose and a knife. On 5th March 2018 she used a knife to cut herself and required to be disarmed by the police. She was admitted for the night to the University Hospital of Wales where she was subject to continuous observation for her safety and transferred to the Ty Llidiard Unit with 3 escorts. Her observation levels were reduced to 15 minute observations on the night of her arrival at Ty Llidiard and her admission to Enfys ward. The reasons for this were not recorded. Shortly after 21.10 on 7th March 2018 staff levels on the ward fell as staff left it to respond to an alarm. At 21.18 Manon was found by 2 staff She could not be revived. In light of her history of impulsive actions it could not be determined whether she intended to end her life. The narrative conclusion which I returned was: Manon Jones died from ligaturing while suffering a mental health episode in circumstances where she ought to have been subject to continuous 1:1 observation pending further assessment. The Inquest focused upon:- 1. The provision of community care in the week leading up to the admission 2. The adequacy of risk formulation upon and after admission 3. How that risk informed the care and treatment planning including levels of observation and the placement of Manon in a bedroom with ligature points 4. Staffing levels 5. The assessment and engagement of Manon while a patient at Ty Llidiard 6. The effectiveness of the resuscitation. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The clinicians assessing Manon on admission to Ty Llidiard did not have available to them the records of her care made in the community by the Crisis team, the Community Intensive Treatment team or the University Hospital of Wales (2) The Clinical records in the Ty Llidiard Unit were not all entered contemporaneously in a single clinical record (3) The absence of a single in and outpatient clinical record impaired the ability of the clinicans at the unit on admission to be able to assess Manon, fix a safe levels of observations, and safeguard her. 6"

B) Short form conclusion - Suicide 2 4,":- Maziellie Mackenzie ('MM') was a looked after child and had been under the care of Cumbria County Council since 2016. She had a history of Mental Health issues and had been diagnosed with PTSD, Attachment Disorder, Anxiety and Depression. Following a number of foster and residential placements which had broken down she had been placed in a tier 4 hospital catering for young people with Mental Health issues between the ages of 13 and 18 at the Cove Heysham and had been there since the 29/05/18. She had a history of self harm which started initially with . Whilst in the Cove there were several incidents of On the 23/06/18 she went on a third period of leave that day with 3 other residents and 2 members of staff to a . At the end of the leave all residents including Maisie refused to return to the Cove. One member of staff was able to persuade one of the residents to return with her. The other member of staff followed two of the other residents who made off in a different direction to MM. MM was discovered a few hours later by a group of youths in a despite CPR an attending paramedic confirmed her death at 23 03 hours. She took her own life and a subsequent note found in her room at the Cove evidenced her intention to do so. In the Narrative conclusion failings at the Cove were identified in that :- 1. Formulation and risk management plans were not revisited when self-harm incidents occurred and did not include Mazie's needs and how they were to be met. 2. Her risk assessment held limited risk history and management plans in regard to Mazie's risk of going missing. 3. There was no written standardised procedure for agreeing and facilitating leave. 4. Communication of relevant information and record-keeping did not meet the required standard. 5. There were insufficient staff members with the 4 residents who were on leave. 4 5",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The medical cause of death given was: 1a. Suspension I returned a conclusion of with Frankie's death more than minimally contributed to by the failures of: 1. Stepping Stone School: a. To provide an effective e-security system as tasked to do so by the department of Education. b. To ensure Frankie's use of the iPad was monitored to confirm her safety. c. To provide Frankie with supervision when not attending lessons despite having an Educational Health Care Plan in place. 2. : a. A lack of robustness in their policies to remove age inappropriate content that allowed Frankie to read stories on their platform on the day of her death featuring , an act which she goes on to complete herself. 4","Frances Rose Thomas (Frankie) was a vulnerable teenager with a number of significant underlying difficulties including childhood trauma, high functioning autism, oppositional behaviour and impulsivity. Stepping Stones School is a school for students with moderate physical or learning difficulties. Frankie was offered a place in year 8 and started in April 2016 with an Educational Care Plan in place. Throughout her time at the school Frankie often refused to attend lessons and at the time of her death rarely attended more than one lesson a week. When not attending lessons, she was left on her own without any formal supervision. During this time, she had access to a school computer and an iPad. During the Inquest I heard evidence Frankie only had access to the during school time using electronic devices supplied by the school. There was an e-security system in place for school computers but it was not monitored by nominated safeguarding leads. This allowed Frankie (as it did for all students) to freely access the without any observation as to what websites were being accessed and for an assessment to be made of their appropriateness. Furthermore, the iPads had no e-security system in place at all, again allowing Frankie to freely access the without any supervision. On the day of her death, Frankie was found to have accessed The stories that Frankie accessed on this platform featured . After school Frankie went home and undertakes a similar act resulting in her death on 25th September 2018. 5","1. I heard evidence that the Department of Education have devolved responsibility for e-security systems with schools having to 'tender' for web filtering software and hardware. However, the guidelines issued by the Department of Education require updating and are insufficiently robust to ensure their effectiveness and meet the changing demands of e-security in schools. 2. There is a wide range of software vendors providing different lists of blocklists with different vendors enabling different categories with no oversight or regulatory guidance by the Department of Education as to what 'blocklists' are either acceptable and/or suitable for a school environment. 3. is not a specifically blocked and not only can it be accessed by Key Stage 4 students there is encouragement to do so in some schools. However, I heard evidence that the sites Frankie accessed through . Furthermore, there is inadequate independent scrutiny by to remove age inappropriate stories put on their platform. 4. Some websites are only blocked when there is a particular key word in the URL If the relevant trigger word (e.g. ) is not there it makes it difficult for the filter to 'see' the content of the website to be able to block it, hence why stories on could be read. However, there are software systems available that acts as a 'key logger' and 'screen reader'. Whilst this will not block the site it will generate a report to the nominated safeguarding individual for further action. Yet it has not been considered or is part of the guidelines issued by the Department of Education 5. In summary, on the evidence I heard there appears to be inadequate regulatory oversight with now outdated guidance issued by the Department of Education with regard to robust standards of e-security systems within schools. 6"

She was referred to the mental health team in November 2019 and was assessed in January 2020. Mary Bush was awaiting referral for psychological therapy at the time of her death. On 6 August 2020 Mary was found to her home. Evidence was heard that Mary had intended to take her own life by her actions 5.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. I was satisfied after hearing evidence that action has been taken to address many of those concerns. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The outstanding matters of concern are as follows: 1. Mary was referred to the mental health team in November 2019 and was assessed in January 2020, some three weeks later than should have been. 2. There was a delay in Mary receiving psychological therapy. She was still on the waiting list at the time of her death. 3. The evidence was that at the date of inquest, there continued to be a delay in service users receiving psychological therapy. Evidence was heard that balancing capacity and demand, which has increased, remains a challenge. The cases referred are of increasing complexity, as in Mary's case 4. Some steps have been taken in an effort to deal with this, such as specific risk assessment training, focusing on intervention treatment plans to aid capacity and throughput, reviewing the skill mix of staff 5. However, there is the ongoing issue of recruitment and retention of suitably skilled staff by the Trust and the ability to resource this to enable the Trust to function effectively 6."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7th June 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide. 4,"Ellis died on 30th September 2020 at Brielle Way, Sheerness, Kent of multiple traumatic injuries not compatible with life. Concerned bystanders on a footbridge Queensbury and Sheeress Stations spoke to Ellis for about five minutes but he refused to climb back to safety. He jumped from the footbridge onto a railway track into path of an oncoming train with the intention of ending his life, at approximately 16:41. Ellis had a history of self-harm and suicidal ideation including thoughts of and attempts to end his life overdose, ligatures and with attempts to jump from a footbridge and in front of an oncoming train that required informal admission to hospital for approximately four months. Ellis had been diagnosed with depression and emotional instability and continued to have episodes of self-harm and thoughts of suicide. Ellis was under the care of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service on discharge in June 2020, with support from Assessment and Liaison Outreach and had an agreed safety plan in place that included Ellis attend Accident and Emergency at hospital if he could not keep himself safe, even with the support of others. Ellis engaged with community mental health services, was taking prescribed medication, disclosed thoughts of suicide and did seek support to keep himself safe. 2 Ellis was rescued from an attempt to hang himself at home on the night of 29th September and had planned telephone psychiatric review the next morning with details of the failed attempt, that Ellis wanted to kill himself and could not keep himself safe. The psychiatrist instructed Ellis and his family to attend a pre-scheduled appointment at 15:00 with his care coordinator. This was a deviation from the safety plan that was not risk assessed and the care coordinator was provided with limited information of a self-harm attempt. When Ellis was assessed at the Seashells Unit he was found to be suicidal requiring a mental health assessment for admission to hospital. The care coordinator sought advice from her manager about the plan should Ellis refuse to go to hospital and was informed that she should call the police. Ellis refused to go to hospital and insisted he did not want to live and left the centre, leaving behind his telephone and tablet device so he could not be contacted The care coordinator telephoned the police at approximately 16:05 who reported Ellis was missing and at imminent risk of killing himself and that he may attempt to travel by train to Faversham, his risks associated with jumping from bridges and in front of trains was not shared. The police updated British Transport Police at 16:28 that Ellis may attempt to board to go to Faversham. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. Box 3 of the record of inquest recorded the following: “Maria Stancliffe-Cook died on 1st August 2019 at Highbury Villas, Cotham, Bristol. She had intentionally taken her own life with the use of helium causing asphyxiation. She had been assessed by the mental health team on 26th July 2019 and her risk had been downgraded from high to medium. She had a telephone call on 28th July 2019 which did not meet the standard; there was no assessment or plan to manage her risk undertaken at this time.” The conclusion was: suicide contributed to by neglect. 4","Maria had a history of poor mental health over many years which resulted in a referral to the mental health team in January 2018. On 18th December 2018 Maria was admitted to A&E at Bristol Royal Infirmary having tried to end her life by using helium, and was referred to crisis team who later discharged her back to the care of her GP. On 23rd January 2019 her GP said that Maria told her that she'd ordered another helium kit, she denied any thoughts and was referred to the mental health team. From then until the events in July there are various appointments with the mental health team, her GP and her therapist. On 12th June 2019 there was a meeting with a number of those caring for Maria the notes say Website www.avon-coroner.com The Coroner's Court, Old Weston Road, Flax Bourton, BS48 1UL “ we expressed our worry with Maria that with the method which she had considered in the past her ongoing social isolation and the sense that it is unlikely she would ask for help from others she would be a high risk of completed suicide if she attempted again. Her lack of protective factors beyond her investment in her studies was also discussed “ Her care coordinator , was present and she said in her evidence that was read, “We were concerned about the ongoing risk of completed suicide given she continued to be in possession of a helium bottle, the risk was not considered to have changed since my first meeting with her when the risk to self was recorded as high”. By 26th July 2019 things significantly changed. She reported to her therapist and GP both who knew her well that she was having active suicidal thoughts. She had told them both that she'd tried to use the helium cylinder but it failed so ordered another one; she also said that she'd been researching high buildings. Her therapist was extremely concerned and said that that this felt like she had a high intention to complete suicide. He reported this to the mental health team. Her GP said that this was a big change; Maria told her that her suicidal thoughts had got worse and they were difficult to dismiss. Her GP referred her to the mental health team explaining her concerns. Maria was seen that evening by two members of the mental health team neither of whom had met her before. They assessed her and decided to downgrade her risk from high to medium. On 28th July 2019 as planned one of the them telephoned Maria, this was Maria's last contact with anyone from the mental health team the call and the note making lasted around 3 minutes, she said that Maria told her she was ok. Sadly on 1st August 2019 – Maria was found dead by police after flat mates became concerned for her. That week she was also supposed to have an appointment with a care coordinator but that had not been arranged. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The trust have themselves admitted the failures reflected in an independent report they commissioned after the death, that report said “we would not expect a patients level of risk to be downgraded from high … to medium immediately following a suicide attempt”; In addition I heard evidence in relation to the assessment on the 26th July 2019 when the risk was downgraded from high to medium. I listened very carefully to the steps that the Trust has taken to make changes following this death and I am pleased that a number of changes have taken place. I raised my concern about the downgrading of risk from high to medium in this case by two members of the team that had no previous dealings with Maria. Maria was well known to the trust and her own care coordinator said “We were concerned about the ongoing risk of completed suicide given she continued to be in possession of a helium bottle, the risk was not considered to have changed since my first meeting with her when the risk to self was recorded as high”. That was a reference to a multidisciplinary meeting which took place a matter of weeks before her death. I was told that risk is dynamic and that professionals assess risk at the time and that it can go up and down. I was also told that there are lots of assessments by staff that do not know patients. That said there is a concern that there is a risk of future death - is it right that the risk of a patient, who is well known to the trust, with a care coordinator who knew her well, is downgraded without any check put in place. 6"

Short form conclusions of Suicide.","At around 21:09 on Monday 20th January 2020 Kesia Blaine Waller was discovered suspended from a ligature at her home address of [REDACTED] City Road, Winchester. She was taken to SGH where she was discovered to have a catastrophic hypoxic brain injury. Further treatment was deemed futile and life-sustaining treatment was withdrawn. Kesia sadly died in hospital on the 25th January 2020.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

At Kesia's Inquest I heard that her place of residence, City Road in Winchester, was a residential housing unit for vulnerable young people aged 16-21. The facility meets a housing need only for the young persons placed there. It was found on the evidence that A2 Dominion employees did not have sufficient training or tools (i.e. implements) in place to prepare staff for the situation that they faced on the 20th January 2020 when they found Kesia hanging in her room, nor could they carry out any physical actions to assist her (i.e. cut her down). There appeared to be no prior appreciation of the risk(s) of self-harm, overdose or attempted suicide of residents, and so on discovering Kesia suspended in her room, the staff were inadequately prepared on multiple levels.
(a) I heard that whilst there has been additional training for the staff on areas of risk such as self-harm, overdose and/or suicide, there have been no physical changes in terms of the provision of tools and implements that staff could use should they be confronted by a young person in distress and/or in need of life-saving attention. It appears to me that without multi-factorial changes there remains a real and significant risk that staff at the residential units will remain unable to take any immediate and potentially life-saving action. The only tools and equipment that remain supplied is a standard home-style first aid kit which is entirely ineffective if a young person has suspended themselves from a ligature.
(b) Although additional training and courses have been added to both the induction training and on-going professional development of staff within the residential units similar to City Road, I remain concerned by the way in which key policies and training are communicated and implemented as this does not appear to have changed. It was clear from the evidence that updates to policies are emailed to employees with a request that the employee responds to the email to confirm receipt. This proved to be wholly ineffective as what appeared to be expected by the company was that the employee would read, digest and understand the policy, and confirm when he/she had done so. The employee on duty on the 20th January 2020 was clearly unfamiliar with the appropriate policies and had only confirmed that he had received the email (which appeared to be all that was required) and not that he had actually read, digested and understood the appropriate policy/ies; how to apply them in practice and what was reasonably expected of him. Although enhanced risk training is now place, it appears to me that without any enhanced diligence to ensure that policies are actually read and understood by those working face-to-face with the vulnerable young adults then the overall effectiveness of risk training and identification is severely flawed."
1091,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/christine-gould/,2021-0185,2021-05-28,Nicholas Moss QC,Cambridgeshire and Peterborough,(1) British Transport Police (2) Network Rail 1,"An investigation commenced on 5 February 2019 into the death of Christine Elizabeth GOULD (Chris) aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 May 2021. • The conclusion of the inquest was that Chris died by suicide when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train on 26 January 2019. • Box 3 of the record of inquest recorded that: “Chris was an informal patient at the Darwin Unit for Young People, Fulbourn, Cambridge. Shortly after 6.30 pm on Saturday 26 January 2019, she was permitted to leave the hospital for a cigarette break. She did not return to the unit as expected, but instead went to the nearby railway line. At about 7.35 pm Chris died when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train, approximately 150 metres to the east of the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing” • I gave a wider narrative conclusion together with factual findings delivered in open court. My narrative conclusion included that: “Given the proximity of the Darwin Unit (and also the Fulbourn Hospital) and previous trespass incidents involving vulnerable patients: (i) Network Rail had made available a suitable and valuable facility for direct communication between CPFT and the signallers to slow the trains. (ii) Network Rail's fencing between and around the Cherry Hinton Bypass and Teversham Level Crossings was less than optimal. However, it would be mere speculation to conclude that this contributed to Chris' death.” 4","My factual findings included that Chris may have accessed the railway line from the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing, from the Teversham Level Crossing or though or over the boundary fence between those level crossings. My factual findings further included that: 1) Network Rail had too readily assumed that Chris had accessed the railway via the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing. 2 2) Both BTP and Network Rail fell into error in promoting that from a credible hypothesis into a firm assumption. 3) Network Rail in written evidence had gone so far as to state that “Access was made by Ms Gould at the crossing not via boundary [fencing]”. There was no proper basis for such a firm assertion of Chris' route of access and this detracted from the otherwise careful evidence provided to the Court by Network Rail. 4) While compliant with standards, the fencing of the lower Class II type between the two level crossings near the Darwin Units should have been considered for upgrading given the proximity of the mental health units and the frequency of trespass incidents. 5) The boundary fencing at the time of Chris' death was less than optimal given the known risks. 6) It is to Network Rail's credit that they have now proactively decided to install 1.8m palisade fencing across the whole boundary area. 7) The annual inspections reporting the fencing as being in good condition did not appear to have captured the frequent cases of damage to the top line of the fencing. Such damage may not have rendered the fencing as in poor condition, but it pointed to trespassing incidents which ought to have been fed back into the risk assessments for the area. 8) In combination, the number of trespass incidents, and the frequent top-line level damage to the fencing should have led to the conclusion that the boundary measure was not preventing trespass. That should have led, but did not in fact lead, to the boundary fence being inspected every three months rather than annually. 9) I noted that Network Rail had already indicated in evidence that it would in future be inspecting the fence boundary every three months. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) Following completed suicides on the railway network BTP and Network Rail are both involved in considering further mitigating measures that may be appropriate at the location to guard against further fatalities. (2) In Chris' case, earlier consideration to the fence boundary being a credible route of access may have led to the fence boundary being improved more quickly after her death. (3) I am concerned that your investigation into, and consideration of, Chris' death did not keep a sufficiently open mind that she may have climbed the boundary fence to access the railway line. If similar assumptions are made in other investigations, there is a risk of future fatalities: there is a risk that mitigating measures will be missed if BTP and Network Rail too readily assume that one point of access to the railway was used when the evidence permits of credible alternative routes of access. Accordingly, I am concerned that"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 April 2021. An investigation commenced on 5 February 2019 into the death of Christine Elizabeth GOULD (Chris) aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 May 2021. These were separate inquests. • Sam died by suicide by an overdose of prescribed medication on 2 September 2018. • Chris died by suicide when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train on 26 January 2019. The conclusion in relation to Sam's death was that the main cause of her death was her Borderline Personality Disorder, which treating clinicians assessed to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood. The conclusion in relation to Chris' death was that the main cause of her death was: (1) her serious mental health disorder (variously diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Mixed Disorder of Conduct and Emotions). Treating clinicians assessed this to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood; (2) The recent death by suicide of her sister Sam (who also suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder) similarly assessed by clinicians to be related to the allegations of their prolonged sexual abuse. In each case, there was a wider narrative conclusion and factual findings delivered in Open Court. Relevant to both CCC's and CPFT's involvement in Sam's death the narrative conclusion included that: “Following two very challenging school related incidents in February 2018, Sam's secondary school faced a difficult decision on whether to permit her to be educated on the main school site. Their decision making approach was unsatisfactory, 2 although they were entitled to be very concerned at the risks involved in Sam being taught on the main site. Communication and joint working between the school, the local authority and CAMHS was, in significant respects, ineffective. A degree of distress and disruption from the events in February 2018 was inevitable but the agencies did not sufficiently mitigate their impact.” Relevant to CCC's involvement in Sam's death, I detailed shortcomings in my factual findings regarding how both education and social care sides of the local authority dealt with Sam's needs. Relevant to CPFT's involvement in Chris' death, the narrative conclusion included that: “When a patient went missing, there was provision for CPFT to contact the train signallers direct in order to slow the local trains (this was provided for in a joint protocol with Network Rail). That step should have been, but was not, immediately taken when Chris failed to return. Had the trains been slowed, it is possible that Chris would not have died that night. This failure occurred because of a combination of factors: a. the particular risk of Chris going to the railway line was recognised but should have been better communicated and documented so that, if Chris went missing, it was immediately clear to all staff; b. the CPFT policy for missing (AWOL) patients was complex and had not been summarised into a shortened ready guide that could be used live during an incident; c. there was some confusion as to whether or not the CPFT AWOL policy had superseded the joint protocol with Network Rail which had permitted the signallers to be contacted directly; d. the AWOL policies were inadequately trained and then inadequately implemented on the night.” Also relevant to CPFT's involvement in Chris' death, I found that there was an inconsistency of approach in what was recorded as Chris' diagnosis. Having apparently settled on a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and Complex PTSD, I found that it was inappropriate for CPFT to keep reverting to a diagnosis of mixed disorder of conduct and emotions rather than continue to identify Border Personality Disorder (or EUPD) in the diagnosis. 4","In addition to the circumstances evident from the summary of the conclusions and findings set out above, when Sam and Chris were cared for at home (which was, during several periods, the best place for their risk of self-harm/suicide to be managed), the need for vigilance around the clock became extremely challenging for their parents. This involved not just physical supervision but a need for care over medication storage and access, and social media use. Although the First Response Service was available, the parents found that it did not offer sufficient support in practice and Chris' increasing aversion to the emergency services (caused by PTSD) meant that the use of ambulance and police responses was also highly problematic. The family's greatest need was for support in the overnight period, which was a need with which social care services and CPFT were not able, materially, to assist. 3 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) Overnight assistance for adolescent mental health patients being cared for at home but with high levels of need (For CPFT and CCC). I heard evidence of increased funding for CPFT being used to extend home treatment options, but that this would be unlikely to extend to a 24/7 service. I also heard evidence from CCC that available support would now be considered under s17 Children Act or s117 Mental Health Act or both but that this would need to be jointly funded between social care and health. I remain concerned that a clear pathway to securing overnight assistance (even if only on a respite basis) for similar cases of exceptional need has not yet been clearly agreed between CPFT and CCC. I am concerned that if alternative supported accommodation in the community were the best solution, there does not appear to be provision for it in-area, so that admission to a mental health unit becomes more likely. (2) Involvement of CCC alongside CPFT in complex adolescent mental health cases where the risk is of suicide / self-harm (For CCC). In some respects CCC's involvement in Chris and Sam's care (social care and education) lacked direction, focus, knowledge and efficiency. I heard evidence of improvements in training in the relevant education and social work teams, and concerning the new Strong Families, Strong Communities Securing Best Outcomes for Children Strategy (March 2021). Further, that CCC is restructuring all of its early help and adolescent services and will be implementing a formal contextual safeguarding framework and that these developments will be in place by the end of 2021. I am concerned that in the midst of restructuring and new guidance, there remains a risk that education inclusion officers and social workers on the ground may still not have sufficient knowledge, guidance and supervision to ensure that CCC give practical and robust support to parents and adolescent patients, alongside treating healthcare agencies, where the main risk of serious harm to the child is from self- harm or suicide arising from adolescent mental health disorders, rather than neglect of harm by a third party. (3) Diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (For CPFT). I am concerned that the evidence in Chris' case, in particular, suggested a degree of age-related reluctance consistently to use the terminology of Borderline Personality Disorder (or Emerging Personality Disorder or EUPD), even when a highly specialist second opinion had supported this and appeared to have been accepted. There are risks associated with a reluctance to use a personality disorder diagnosis (c.f. Position Statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists dated January 2020). I received evidence that there have already been some changes/improvements in the preparedness to recognise Borderline Personality Disorder and that further consideration will be given in the context of the new ICD 11. (4) AWOL patients from Darwin Centre for Young People (For CPFT). I heard evidence that since Chris' death, staff have been reminded of the applicable policies; and that an audit has shown good compliance with the provision for calling the local signallers. I heard evidence that there is to be a further review of CPFT's own AWOL policy. I remain concerned that: (i) CPFT's own policy is too lengthy and complex to serve as reference-guidance during a live AWOL incident. In particular the flow chart summary is unnecessarily complex and hard to follow (at least as a tool to consult during a stressful incident); (ii) there is a risk of confusion in having two policies both of which are meant to be followed; (iii) there did not appear be desktop-drills / other training exercises / information grab-packs (etc.) to ensure that all nurses in charge are properly equipped and trained to deal with AWOL incidents efficiently (iv) steps ought to be taken at managerial level to ensure that the confusion over the two policies and whether one had been superseded (evidence of which only emerged during the inquest) cannot recur in this, or other areas, when new policies are introduced. 4 6"

(2) NHS England. 1,"An investigation commenced on 13 September 2018 into the death of SAMANTHA JANE GOULD (Sam) aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 April 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was: • Sam died by suicide by an overdose of prescribed medication. • The main cause of Sam's death was her borderline personality disorder, which treating clinicians assessed to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood. The disorder caused a persistent but unpredictable and fluctuating risk of serious deliberate self-harm and suicide. • There was a wider narrative conclusion, the aspect most relevant to this report being that: “There was a systemic weakness and failing in the lack of a protocol for [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service – CAMHS] and the GP service to communicate with local pharmacies concerning 16-18 year old patients with mental health conditions who were at risk of deliberate overdose. Sam was therefore able to pick up older prescriptions on 1 September 2018 without challenge. It was those medications … that were fatal in the combined amounts Sam ingested on the night of 1-2 September 2018.” 4","There was a safety plan agreed with Sam's consultant psychiatrist whereby, although Sam was over the age of 16, Sam's parents would be responsible for her medication. On 30 August 2018, Sam's treating psychiatrist in the community made a change to Sam's medication giving her a paper prescription. Sam expressed a preference to tell her mother about the change in medication (new prescription of Topiramate) directly and the psychiatrist had to make a judgement call whether or not to breach medical confidence and tell Sam's mother about this directly. On balance she chose not to. In the event, Sam did not tell her mother about the new prescription. Shortly before 1 pm on Saturday 1 September 2018, Sam instead went to her local pharmacy with the prescription for Topiramate and Lorazepam. She collected those medications as well as 2 older prescriptions for other medications she would previously not have known were being held there. At her home on School Lane, Fulbourn at some time after 01.23 on the morning of 2 September 2018, Sam took a very large quantity of some of the prescribed medications. She went to bed, fell unconscious and died within at most a couple of hours. The local pharmacy (who do not have access to patients' records on SystmOne) had not been told about the safety plan. As Sam was 16 years old, she was assumed competent to take her own prescriptions and the pharmacists had no immediate reason not to provide them to Sam, being ignorant of the safety plan. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) There did not appear to be any national guidance or standards that directed or encouraged appropriate sharing of risk information and care plans with the local pharmacy. As a result, the pharmacy was unsighted on the fact that the treating psychiatric team had a safety plan involving Sam's parents being responsible for handling and administering all medication. Had the pharmacy been aware of this plan, it is likely that they would either have refused to provide the medication with which Sam overdosed or, at least, contacted Sam's parents or General Practitioner. (2) A local protocol has now been introduced whereby the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ensures that any pharmacy used regularly by their patients aged 16-17 are (where appropriate) advised of relevant care plans, as well as the responsible GP being so informed. This is now to be part of mandatory training for CAMHS prescribing staff and is to be discussed in the local Joint Prescribing Group to ensure better communication between the local NHS Trusts, G.P.s and local pharmacies. Accordingly, action has already been taken in the local area to prevent similar fatalities. However, (3) I am concerned that there is a risk of future fatalities if action is not taken at a national level to ensure that pharmacies are appropriately involved in medication safety plans for mental health patients aged 16 – 17, given that such patients may otherwise be able to obtain prescribed medication with which to overdose. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 06/11/20. The determination of the inquest as to the medical cause of death was a massive head injury and multiple trauma owing to impact with a train, and as to conclusion, suicide. 2 4","In Autumn 2018, Xuanze was a student attending Coventry University enrolled on a degree course in Architecture. He was aged 17, having been born on 10/12/2000 in the Heping district of Shenyang, China. He was living in student accommodation. At Coventry University he was categorised as a Tier 4 overseas student. Due to his age and nationality he was required to have a guardian within the UK. A condition of his UK student visa was that he attended his university course. Xuanze's attendance on his university course was limited. Because of the amount of the course he missed he was sent a number of emails requesting his attendance at meetings with staff to discuss his absence. He did not respond to these invitations which resulted in an email being sent to him on 29/11/2018, indicating that he was at risk of being removed from the course and that he should attend a meeting to discuss this on 03/12/2018; removal from the course would in turn have affected his permission to remain in the UK on his student visa. There was no face to face meeting with Xuanze in advance of the email being sent to him on 29/11/2018, and neither Xuanze's family nor his guardian were informed that Xuanze was not attending his university course, nor were they informed of the meeting he had been requested to attend to discuss his removal from the course. On 03/12/18 shortly before 5 a.m. Xuanze left his student accommodation and went to Coventry Railway station. He walked to the end of platform one and proceeded along the side of the tracks. Approximately 500 meters outside of Coventry Railway station heading south, Xuanze was struck by a passenger train which caused him to sustain catastrophic injuries. He is likely to have died instantly as a result of the collision and his life was formally declared extinct at 07:35 hours. The inquest conclusion is suicide. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (.1) The University did not have a face to face meeting with Xuanze, a student under the age of 18, prior to sending him the email dated 29/11/2018 indicating that he was at risk of being removed from the course and that he should attend a meeting to discuss this on 03/12/2018; (.2) In the absence of a face to face meeting with Xuanze, the University did not contact either Xuanze's Guardian or Parents prior to sending Xuanze the email dated 29/11/2018 indicating that Xuanze was at risk of being removed from the course and that he should attend a meeting to discuss this on 03/12/2018; 3 Evidence was given at the inquest that in the case of an overseas student under 18, notwithstanding both prolonged absence from academic commitments and a persistent omission to respond to email requests that the absentee student should make contact with the university, there was no procedure or policy in place either for a face to face meeting with the student or, in the absence of such a face to face meeting, for contacting that student's Guardian or Parents, prior to the email being sent indicating that the U.18 student was at risk of being removed from the course and that he should attend a meeting to discuss this. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18th February 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was that Miss Boothe's death was as a result of suicide, with the medical cause of death being 1 (a) Nitrite Toxicity 4","Sophie had a history of mental health issues. She had been under the care of CAM HS as a teenager when she suffered with anorexia nervosa. Sophie went to Australia on holiday in 2019 and, whilst she was there, she took an overdose of propranolol, which it is believed she had been stockpiling from prescriptions issued by her UK GP as well as obtaining further propranolol whilst in Australia. Sophie was in hospital in Sydney for 18 days upon being declared medically fit for discharge she was ""Scheduled"" (the Australian equivalent of a patient being ""Sectioned"" under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983 (as amended) and taken to a Mental Health Clinic. She remained in Australia for a short period before being declared as Fit to Fly, whereupon she returned home to the UK under the escort of her mother. Sophie had emailed Talking Therapies from Australia on the 19th April 2019 and was advised to self-refer to see her GP upon her return to the UK. Sophie saw her GP on the 8th May 2019 who referred her to the CPE for an urgent assessment. The GP in his urgent Red referral enclosed the full discharge summary from Australia (which stretched to some 17 pages). This referral was downgraded by an assessing CPE clinician to Amber, without any rationale being entered onto supporting records as to why this decision to downgrade was taken . This meant that she had to wait around 3-4 weeks (depending on fluctuating wait times) for an appointmenUtelephone assessment. A telephone assessment took place between Sophie and a Mental Health Nurse on the 7th June 2019 at 09.30am. Sophie presented as friendly, bubbly and plausible. She had good insight into her actions on the 1st April 2019 and identified many protective factors. Sophie was adamant that she did not want Mental Health input at this time. Sophie had completed two degrees in psychology and had previously worked for the CAM HS and so knew the answers to qive to the clinician's questions to avoid any further enqaqement 1 with, or input from, the mental health services. Both of Sophie's parents acknowledged that she was manipulative in this regard. The plan following this telephone assessment was to discharge Sophie at that time, but with signposting to further support should she feel that she needed it. Sophie's mother remained concerned at attended the GP to discuss Sophie on the 18th June 2019 as a result of which the GP re-referred Sophie to the CPE . Sadly, no further assessment could be made as Sophie was reported missing by her family later that afternoon. She was discovered on the 19th June 2019 at a hotel in Hook, where she had checked in, alone, the night before. The post-mortem result revealed that Sophie had died as a result of nitrite toxicity. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken . In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - It became very clear in evidence that the overseas involvement was not properly flagged up when the CPE came to triage Sophie's referral; this includes both the discharge summary and Sophie's own self-referral via email whilst she was in Australia. The full discharge summary from Australia was sent by the GP along with his referral on the 8th May 2019 to ensure that all relevant information was shared at the earliest stage. These notes were either not fully reviewed and/or understood by the CPE and this appears to have contributed to the downgrading of Sophie's referral. It became clear in evidence that the UK services did not understand that ""Scheduled"" is the Australian equivalent of being ""Sectioned"" and there was a lack of probity and curiosity to as what this meant and what treatment Sophie had in Australia; albeit that the evidence was not convincing (or even persuasive) that the Australian discharge summary had been thoroughly read at all on being received by the CPE . Overall, there appears, on the evidence, to be very poor communication between the departmental services and, as a result, opportunities appear to have been missed to fully appreciate Sophie's full clinical presentation when making an assessment about the timeliness of appropriate interventions and assessments. I believe that whilst the service remains disjointed, with insufficient exploration of information sent from foreign jurisdictions, there remains a risk that future death will continue to occur. 6"
1573,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/shneur-kaye/,2020-0013,2020-01-17,Edward Morgan,Manchester (North),Bury Council,On the 29 August 2018 the Senior Coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Shneur Zalman Kaye. The Inquest concluded on 17 January 2020 when I recorded a conclusion of Misadventure.,"Shneur died at home on 24 August 2018, by reason of suffocation caused by inhalation of helium. He was 14 years old. For some years, Shneur had experienced behavioural difficulties. He had been diagnosed with ADHD and had been supported by the community paediatric team. His treatment included regular medication.
On 17 April 2017, Shneur was conveyed to North Manchester General Hospital following erratic behaviour and a suggestion of an overdose. North West Ambulance service filed a Safeguarding Referral with the Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) operated by Bury on 17 April 2017. At that time, Shneur was not attending any local authority maintained school. He was not previously known to Social Services. On 19 April 2017, the social worker decided there was no need for action and the referral was closed. Prior to closure of the referral, there was no contact made with the family or with Shneur himself. Following this decision, neither the fact of the referral or the reasons for it was shared with any third party, service or agency.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-

1. The decision to close a referral without prior contact with parents (where there is no safeguarding or legal reason why such contact should not be made) potentially deprives the Social Worker of the opportunity to contextualise the event or concern which has triggered the referral, and of forming an informed view of the welfare of the child to whom the referral relates;
2...The evidence received by the Court indicates that the closure of the safeguarding referral marks an end to social services involvement. Despite this no attempt is made to share the fact of the referral or the reasons for it with any third party, service or agency. This may have the unintended result of depriving third parties (including parents) and agencies already participating in the care and welfare of a child from being alerted to the concern and taking appropriate action (including accessing other services) in response to it. The submissions made on behalf of the council indicate these practices are driven by considerations of data protection compliance The practice imperils the precedence to be given to the paramountcy principle and has the potential to undermine the protection of children who are the subject of referral.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe each of you respectively have the power to take such action."

The investigation concluded by way of an inquest hearing from 2 to 5 December 2019 (a copy of the record of inquest is enclosed with the covering letter to this report). My findings at inquest were as follows: -

- Medical cause of death: -
1a Ligature around the neck.
1b Mental health issues and autism.

- Summary of circumstances: -
Jacob died as a result of placing plastic ties around his neck as ligatures. Although he had not given any immediate indication to anyone that he was contemplating taking his own life he was assessed as being at on-going risk of serious self-harm. Due to the nature of the act, his self-harm history, the on-going assessed risk, and his leaving of a 'suicide' note I found that he had undertaken a deliberate act with the intention of taking his own life. Just prior to his death a six month unregulated placement had recently been ended, and prior to that placement he had spent over two and a half years in a succession of secure placements.

On the evidence I did not find that factors associated with the unregulated placement had directly contributed to Jacob's death.

- My conclusion as to Jacob's death was a short form conclusion of suicide.","Jacob had diagnoses of autism and mental health problems. Following a serious overdose in February 2014 he was thereafter placed in a succession of secure placements under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983 and the Children Act 1989 until he returned to his home area of Chesterfield around Christmas 2016 when he was placed, under the provisions of s.20 Children Act 1989, in an unregulated placement for young people aged between 16 and 18 years of age and was also supported by local authority social care and child and adolescent mental health services. The Chesterfield placement was not a specialist placement for young people with autism or mental health problems and the placement had been made in the context of a specialist placement having given very short notice of termination of placement. There had been many episodes of self-harm following the overdose in February, some serious, including just two months prior to his death and he was assessed at on-going risk of serious self-harm. The Chesterfield placement came to an end following Jacob's decision to move in to live with his father where he received on-going support from the agencies.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

As I have stated I did not find that the evidence established a causal or contributory connection between the unregulated placement and Jacob's death. I found this to be so on the applicable civil law test, the balance of probabilities. However in my summing-up I did express my serious concerns that Jacob had been placed in an unregulated placement despite his history, needs, and risks.

Evidence was given at the inquest hearing by two former employees at the placement that they had no prior experience of working with young people (indeed no experience of working in any form of care-related work) and were left in charge of the unit where Jacob was placed after a very short period of commencing employment (one former staff member said that he had only completed two shadowing sessions before being asked to be in sole charge of the unit overnight).

The evidence of the responsible local authority was that it had not sought evidence from the placement provider as to staff competency and training, or that suitable policies and procedures were in place; it effectively accepted the assurances of the provider.

The local authority stated that it now has systems providing for greater scrutiny and diligence but it was explained that where residential/supported provision is solely for young people aged 16 to 18 that provision falls outside or the statutory regime of inspection and regulatory compliance as enforced by Ofsted. My understanding is that the issue of unregulated placements for 16 to 18 year olds has been widely highlighted as a cause for concern but the evidence of a senior local authority manager at inquest was that she was unaware of any plans nationally to address the issue despite concerns having been very widely raised.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: -

1. Vulnerable young people, aged 16 to 18, are being placed in unregulated placements.

2. Any young person under the age of 18 placed in an unregulated placement is likely to have very significant vulnerabilities, and it is likely that young people with complex needs and at significant risk are being placed in such placements; indeed this was the case for Jacob.

3. As the placements are unregulated there are no statutory regulations to comply with relating to competency and appropriate policies and procedures by the provider and there is no regulatory body to check and assess those providers. This is clearly a very concerning situation given the very high level needs that some of the young people will have.

4. The lack of statutory regulation then places an onus on local authorities to check that a provider is competent and safe. Whilst in making individual placements it must be the duty of a local authority to satisfy itself as best as it is able that placements are 'safe', given the pressures on local authorities it cannot be the case that they are in a position to mirror the type and nature of inspection and oversight that might be provided by a regulator such as Ofsted.

5. In view of the points made above the lack of statutory regulation is placing vulnerable young people at risk, and there is a realistic possibility that deaths may occur."

The medical cause of death was 1a) Severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; 1b) Asphyxia from hanging,"Katie Croft was a vulnerable child who was a victim of abuse which she reported. On 17th October 2018 Greater Manchester Police and Tameside Children's Services began an investigation. Katie was spoken to by both agencies having already given a detailed account to her school, which had reported the disclosure. The working together principles applied to the investigation which require that the voice of the child should be a focus for all agencies.

Subsequently Katie via her mother indicated she did not want to support a prosecution. The case was closed by Greater Manchester Police without being countersigned by a supervisor or any further face to face discussion with Katie or assessment of the evidence. A multi-agency strategy meeting was held and concluded Katie was being safeguarded. A child and family assessment was subsequently completed by an agency social worker from Children's Services without any further discussion with Katie. It was not shared with Katie or her family.

On 18th December 2018 Katie disclosed to her form teacher that she was considering self-harm or worse. A cause for concern form was completed but subsequently misplaced. Action was taken to notify her parents of Katie's disclosure and her mother was spoken to. Katie had previously self-harmed. No further action was taken in relation to this disclosure. On 8th January 2019 Katie sent her previous form teacher, who had left the school, a message via social media. She said she had no one else to talk to who knew what she was feeling and that she thought about the abuse every day and had cut herself the day before. The message was shared with the school safeguarding lead that evening and Katie was spoken to at school the following day. She denied sending the message.

She continued with lessons. School attempted to notify her family of the concern. After school she returned home. As a result of concerns raised by one of her friends school were contacted and contact was made with her family who tried to contact her and check on her wellbeing. Her friend went to check on her and found Katie suspended from a ligature at her home address.

She was resuscitated and taken to hospital. However she had sustained catastrophic brain damage and died at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital on 15th January 2019.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
1. The inquest was told that GMP followed their own guidance which accorded with that of the College of Policing into the level of expertise of the officer allocated to investigate Katie's allegations. As a result of this the case was not dealt with by an experienced Public Protection or specialist sexual offences trained officer. It was allocated to a probationary police constable with approximately 6 months experience. The officer did not seize the phone which contained key social media contents until her third visit on the initial evening the offence was disclosed. The allocated officer was not experienced in joint working with social services or familiar with the concept of the voice of the child and what it would mean in such a case. At the time the decision was made by police to NFA matters there was no discussion about whether there could be a victimless prosecution; it was not established if the initial account was recorded on body worn footage or the extent of the social media contact by the suspect and the nature of any offences that could be revealed by those messages. No attempt was made to have a further face to face conversation with Katie;

2. The Local Authority at the time were using a substantial number of agency social workers. As a result the Child and Family Assessment was not completed in accordance with best practice and not shared in accordance with expectations around best practice. The Local Authority has since made significant progress in moving away from a reliance on agency staff to fill gaps in social work cover. The inquest was told that agency social workers are still used extensively in other Local Authorities creating a risk that a similar situation could arise;

3. At the safeguarding strategy meeting an officer allocated to attend such meetings on behalf of GMP attended rather than an officer allocated to the case. As a result the quality of information sharing and understanding of the allegation was more limited. On the particular police division in question this practice has stopped. It was unclear how common the approach is on a wider basis;

4. It was accepted by witnesses for both the Local Authority and GMP that the voice of the child was not fully heard throughout their investigations. They via the safeguarding board commissioned an independent report whose findings and recommendations have been fully adopted by the safeguarding board. It was unclear what if any steps would be taken to disseminate the lessons pan GM or nationally;

5. A further concern identified was that there was no mechanism for the school to be formally be aware of information within the Child and Family Assessment. As a result there was no formal follow-up procedure set out in the best practice national guidance the school was working within. The inquest heard that Katie's school recognising this gap has built on the working together guidance to develop guidance that ensures there is a proactive approach to engaging with a child and their family post the writing of a Child and Family Assessment;

6. On the day Katie committed suicide she had attended a GCSE English class. The exam board required poetry syllabus was being studied that day. The lesson included a poem where the contextualisation of it included the use of suicide. The teacher delivering the lesson had no way of understanding the history of self-harm of Katie and her particular vulnerability when delivering a set text in accordance with the exam board requirements. It was unclear what if any guidance is given by the exam board to assist teachers minimising risk to pupils in this scenario."

The investigation concluded on the 20th September 2019 and the conclusion was one of: Narrative: Suicide contributed to by a failure by mental health services to recognise the increasing level of risk he presented as he transitioned from child and adolescent mental health services into the reduced provision and support available post 16.

The medical cause of death was 1a) Heroin Overdose","Oliver Richard Sharp was a year ahead of his chronological age at school and excelled academically. Whilst at Manchester Grammar School he began to change his approach to school and his friends. He disclosed to a CBT therapist the extent of how he was struggling with how he felt about himself and his friendships. On 17th April 2016 he disclosed he was self-harming. On 21st April 2016 he saw the GP and was referred to CAMHS. On 25th April 2016 Oliver took 48 Paracetamol tablets and disclosed that to his family who took him to Stepping Hill Hospital. He returned to school and continued under CAMHS. He was put on a 6 month waiting list for an ADOS assessment, which took place in November 2016 and was inconclusive.

In September 2016 he returned to year 11 at Manchester Grammar School. He was struggling to cope with the academic demands and there was a focus on trying to help him catch up academically and keep him safe. He showed signs of becoming concerned about failing and struggled to cope with friendship groups. The delayed ADOS assessment indicated he was not autistic.
He continued to self-harm over Christmas 2016, and on 2nd January 2017 he took an overdose of paracetamol and was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital. It was agreed with CAMHS that a 2nd opinion would be sought about him. The psychiatric assessment identified a complex picture including difficulties with emotional literacy and empathy. The overall diagnosis was of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ADHD and Emotional Behavioural Dysregulation.
Following his January overdose, work continued with CAMHS and he returned to school. He became increasingly isolated and by the time of GCSEs he took only English and Maths but did not answer the papers. He left Manchester Grammar School and transferred to Beech Hall School in September 2017, dropping back to a year below his chronological age to repeat year 10. Over summer 2017 he began to work with the Autism Team and they helped support him into Beech Hall School.
In October 2017 he went missing from home and was found on a motorway bridge at 5am. He had not been taking his medication. Family therapy and sessions with his case manager continued. There were discussions about post 16 provision as he approached his 16th Birthday. CAMHS within Stockport is a service for children up to 16. Discussions regarding discharge continued and because of the way in which Mental Health Services were structured the plan was to discharge to the GP. Overall he had settled at Beech Hall, although attendance was erratic. In June 2018 the last family therapy session was due to take place. He had gone missing from home.
On 12th June 2018 he presented at Manchester Royal Infirmary seeking help having slept rough in Manchester and reporting thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to CAMHS for follow up. On 14th June 2018 he told Beech Hall he was likely to harm himself if he went home. They took him to Macclesfield A&E where a detailed assessment and gathering of information resulted in him being admitted on a voluntary basis to the Hope unit.
He arrived there at 1am on 15th June. He did not like it. He was assessed and was allowed to leave the unit on 15th June.
Following further psychiatric assessment from the unit whilst in the community he was placed on quetiapine. Concordance was initially good but deteriorated. The planned discharge from the Hope Unit services took place on 2nd July 2018. On 2nd July 2018 he went missing from home and was found at Crewe Railway Station. The CAMHS plan was to discharge him and move him to the transition team which was discussed on 20th August 2018. He was to have a new therapist.
On 24th August 2018 he went missing from home. He was found and taken to Stepping Hill Hospital and assessed by RAID. He had bought paracetamol with the intention of taking his life. He expressed concern about his discharge from CAMHS. He was discharged to see CAHMS on 31st August 2018. He was due to return to Beech Hall on 5th September 2018.
On 5th September he was reported as missing from home. He was found by a member of the public in the early hours of the morning having taken an overdose of heroin. Medical intervention reversed the outcome of the overdose. He was assessed by the RAID team. There was a failure to consider the full circumstances of his history and a failure by mental health providers involved in his care to effectively communicate. As a result the level of risk he presented was not adequately understood. He was discharged to the Home Treatment Team. The Home Treatment Team saw him on 13th September 2018. Professionals in his care recognised the increasing risk in relation to his behaviour. The Home Treatment Team failed to appreciate the level of risk he presented.
On the evening of 14th September 2018 he presented at A&E at Stepping Hill Hospital with suicidal ideation. He was seen and assessed by RAID. There was a failure to fully assess him or understand the complexities and level of risk he presented. He was discharged home into the community to see the Home Treatment Team on 15th September 2018. He saw the Home Treatment Team on 15th, 18th and 30th September 2018. On 30th September he was discharged from the Home Treatment Team.
On 8th October at school he appeared to accept the reduced academic aspirations for him. A further reduced academic timetable was sent to him on 12th October 2018.
On 17th October 2018 he went missing from home. This was reported to Greater Manchester Police. On the morning of 18th October 2018 he was found by a dog walker in Gatley Hill. A typed note was found on him. He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital and his death was confirmed. Toxicology confirmed that he had taken a fatal dose of heroin.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
The inquest was told that the provision of mental health services post 16 varies widely across the country. In some areas there is a CAMHS 16-25 mental health service provision similar to the national 16 and under service whereas in other areas there a limited transition service or move back to primary care for re-referral to adult services. The inquest was told that this creates a cliff edge high risk situation for adolescents. The reason for the difference was resources and decisions taken by CCGs.

The inquest was told that it is important for autism to be diagnosed as early as possible so that appropriate support can be put in place. Early diagnosis was impacted by a national picture of long waiting lists for ADOS assessments. In Stockport there was approximately a 6 month waiting list for assessment. This was against a national picture of 12-24 month waits in some areas.

During the inquest evidence was heard that acceleration ahead of a chronological school age might cause relatively few difficulties in peer relationships up to about year 9 but post that as children entered adolescence it could become a significant issue impacting a child's mental health and ability to cope. Where it did happen, there needed to be an understanding by schools of the risks and early signs indicating a need for additional support to try to reduce the likelihood of self-harming behaviours and the potential need for additional support.

The inquest heard that Oliver had found the autism label and the label of disability that was attached to it very difficult to accept as time went on. There was evidence that particularly with high achieving children with autism the idea that they had a disability created additional challenge. The language that it would have been more helpful to use widely would have been difference rather than disability."

Name:

Daniel Cameron SHORROCKS

Medical Cause of Death:

Multiple Injuries

Conclusion:

Took own life

On 1 January 2018 at Berry Head, Torbay, Devon","The deceased was born in Torbay on 3 September 2000. Before his birth Torbay Childrens Social Care had identified potential for his significant harm following his birth.

He was known to the Police by September 2002 when he was found playing alone in a park. Reports were made to Torbay Childrens Social Care indicating that he had been neglected.

At age five, consideration was given to long term care by Torbay Childrens Services. In June 2007 approval was given for a kinship care in Essex. This was brought to an end at short notice and he was returned to Torbay. He spent several years in various foster care and respite care placements. The precise number of placements could not be identified.

In January 2010 he was made know to the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service following his jumping a river and expressing a wish to die. On 18 September 2017 the deceased's then foster carer became concerned for his welfare, having found a note. The Police were notified. The deceased was located on a viaduct by the Police and taken to a place safety for assessment. He was referred to the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service Crisis Team. The Crisis Team subsequently closed his support/case. On 14 December 2017 he was accepted into the Torbay Autism Assessment Service.

On 1 January 2018 the deceased told his then foster carer that he was going to visit a friend and would return at 7pm. The deceased visited his friend. The account of the investigating Police Officer is that he discussed ending his own life with the friend. At 7.01pm his foster carer received a text 'Dead at Berry Head'. The deceased's jacket was located at the top of a cliff at Berry Head. His dead body was at the foot of the cliff.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) I ask please that your Department reviews the availability of resources to those Local Authorities which have a high proportion of young people in care and disproportionately few qualified and experienced staff.

(2) I would also ask your Department to review the integration of services between Local Authority Care Services, Adolescent Mental Health Services and Pastoral Care provided in education settings."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28/06/2019. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging from ligature around the neck 4,"Sam died on 09/11/2018 at home Milton Keynes having been found hanging by the neck by his sister on her return from school. Sam had been engaged with COMPASS services through a school referral. He had been referred to CAMHS in May 2018 but did not meet the threshold for engagement. His GP suggested other organisations who Sam could approach voluntarily for support, but he did not take up these suggestions. 5","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1) Sam's GP referred Sam to CAMHS when he presented to the GP with irritability, anger and a report that he was close to being excluded from school. CAMHS rejected the referral because Sam did not meet their threshold of moderate to severe mental health issues. CAMHS did not suggest any alternative assistance. The GP did follow up with Sam to sign post him to two independent organisations who Sam would have to approach independently for help. The GP made it clear in his evidence that there is a lack of lower level assistance for young people who present with 'life issues' such as low mood, irritability and anger issues, but who nonetheless need help and assistance but do not meet the criteria for access to CAMHS services. 2) Sam had been referred to, and was receiving the services of COMPASS having been referred by his School. The GP was not made aware of this engagement and was unable to take this into account at the time when Sam did present himself to the GP. The evidence from COMPASS is that they maintain the confidentiality of patients even minors using their services unless they have express consent to disclose that information from the patient themselves. Without all relevant information neither the GP nor CAMHS was in a position to make a fully informed decision about the Sam's needs. Sharing of information between relevant health agencies to ensure fully informed decisions are made as regards the healthcare needs of an individual should be a priority. 3) Evidence at the inquest from the GP also indicated that a reduction in healthcare provision at Sam's school and in particular the removal of a medically qualified person(s) has meant that confidential health information is no longer shared between the school and the GP surgery. The school now only engages First Aiders, who are not medically qualified, and who do not therefore exchange information which in the past has proved essential in flagging concerns between the GP and the School. This is another route which has been closed and which would have allowed a potential flag to have been raised in respect of concerns around Sam and his wellbeing to be shared confidentially between GP and school. 6"
1872,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/geoff-gray/,2019-0216,2019-06-20,HH Peter Rock QC,Surrey,1. The Chief,On 26 February 2019 I commenced an inquest into the death of Pte Geoff GRAY. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2019 The conclusion of the inquest was that Geoff Gray's death was by suicide. 4,"At approximately 01.10 hours on 17 September 2001 in the grounds of the Officers' Mess of the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, Surrey, Private Geoff Gray was found shot. Beside him was a SA80 rifle that was set to automatic, he had two fatal wounds to the head. Geoff was 17½ years old. At the very outset the assumption was made by attending civilian and military police and by the coroner's officer that this death was a suicide. A 'routine' coronial post-mortem was requested and was performed on the day of Geoff's death. The examining pathologist was told the death was not-suspicious and was not directed by the coroner to carry out a forensic post-mortem. The examination was therefore one of several bodies examined in that session. There were no investigating police officers present who could give further information to the pathologist if required (albeit for training purposes two members of the RMP had attended). In the course of the post-mortem examination: no photographs were taken; there were no x-rays or other imaging undertaken; a body map was not drawn; there was no attempt to reconstruct the skull or track the bullets; there was no attempt to match entry wounds to the relevant item of clothing (a beret). The deceased's clothes were sent for destruction the next day rather than retained for chemographic analysis. 2 The examining pathologist, who was a forensic pathologist, told me that generally photographs and x-rays would not be taken at a routine post mortem and that he would never do so. Other investigative inadequacies in the investigation of Geoff Gray's death were added to by the absence of either a forensic post-mortem, or at least additional steps being taken within a 'routine' coronial post-mortem and the retention of Geoff's clothes. Two earlier deaths of young trainees from gunshot wounds at the same barracks in 1995 (Private Sean Benton and Ms Cheryl James), were also both investigated with 'routine' coronial post-mortems. In Sean Benton's case I have earlier heard the fresh inquest into his death, which concluded in July 2018. His post-mortem was carried out by a general histopathologist, who had no experience of performing an autopsy after a death from high velocity gunshot wounds. At the inquest into the death of Sean Benton two expert Forensic Pathologists, and produced a joint report in which they agreed that much potentially useful evidence had been lost due to inter alia the absence of post-mortem photographs and the lack of adequate post-mortem description in relation to both the external and internal features of the gunshot wounds. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. I instructed as an independent expert in forensic pathology. He told me that the practice in Northern Ireland is that every firearms death, whatever the circumstances, will be subject to a forensic post-mortem. 2. Both and , the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem told me that that there is no specific guidance to either pathologists, and as I understand it to coroners, that urges them to give particular consideration to the nature of the post- mortem examination in cases of death by firearms, even when that death is of a child. 3. It is of concern that where assumptions of suicide lead to cursory post- mortem investigations this creates a risk that homicides will go undetected. The higher the possibility that homicides will be distinguished from self-inflicted deaths, the greater the deterrence to those who might have reason to try to make a murder look like a suicide. 3 4. The use of a forensic post-mortem, or at very least something more than a basic 'routine' examination in all cases of sudden death by gunshot may, by enhancing the quality of investigations and ensuring that assumptions of suicide are properly tested, reduce that risk. 6"

Chief Executive, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust Copied for interest to: 2. Noah Lomax's family. 3. The Crookes GP Practice, Sheffield. 1",An investigation was commenced into Noah Lomax's death on 8 August 2018 and an Inquest was opened the same day. I concluded an inquest on 24 May 2015. The findings of the court were as follows: Medical Cause of death 1(a) Multiple Injuries Conclusion: Suicide 4,"Noah was 15 years of age. At the beginning of July 2018 Noah's mother was made aware of online communication between Noah and a friend in which he expressed an intention to take his own life by jumping off a bridge. Noah's mother acted immediately upon this concern and both made an appointment for Noah to see his GP and to attend Door43 an organisation that provides emotional support for young people. Noah's and his mother attended the GP appointment with the specific intention to obtain help by way of a referral to CAMHS. Noah's GP was told that he had suicidal thoughts and had plans to take his own life. Noah's GP completed a written, non-urgent, referral to CAMHS CAMHS processed the referral promptly but the referral contained insufficient information for a risk assessment to be performed Therefore, CAMHS closed Noah's referral but invited his GP to provide further information. Noah's GP planned to use the appointment arranged on 6 August 2018 as an opportunity to obtain the further information sought by CAMHS. Noah's family were not notified that CAMHS had declined the referral. The Trust accepted that the process of requesting further information was not sufficiently robust and that telephone contact with the GP should have been made. This would have avoided the need for a re-referral. Had the information been known that Noah was actively making plans to take his own life CAMHS would have categorised his appointment as urgent and seen him within 2 weeks. Assumptions were made regarding the support being offered to Noah by Door43. The Trust accepted that the actual level of support ought to have been confirmed directly between CAMHS and Door43. The Trust accepted that the current referral form does not capture the information required to process referrals without delay. Noah went on holiday with his father and step-mother between 22 July and 29 July 2018. Noah was not seen by CAMHS on his return. On 1 August 2018 Noah was not open with his mother about his plans. Instead of spending the day with friends he travelled, by a pre-planned route, to Conisborough Viaduct. Sometime after 1.30pm Noah took his own life by jumping from the Viaduct. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. As I made clear during the Inquest I was concerned about the adequacy of the CAMHS, GP referral form. , Noah's GP, was inexperienced she had not completed a CAMHS referral form before. She accepted that she had not provided sufficient detail in the form. This resulted in CAMHS being unable to assess Noah's risk and declining Noah's referral. This in turn meant that Noah did not receive an appointment with CAMHS before his death. The Trust's investigation report stated that the evidence “suggests that the current referral form does not capture the information required to process referrals without delay.” , CAMHS Clinical Lead, said that there had not been any other problems with the form with GP's not completing them sufficiently. I am not sure how is able to be so confident about this. I was told that redesigning the form had been considered by the Trust but was told that this was not the answer. Instead, further training has been provided to GPs within the area. Guidance is attached to the form to assist GPs in completing the form. Having carefully considered the evidence I am not satisfied that steps have been put in place to ameliorate the risk identified. Given the realities of the pressures on a GP's day expecting a GP to use their 10 minute appointment to extract sufficient information for the referral and then at some point complete a referral form, with which they may be unfamiliar, creates the risk that relevant information may not be provided. I would invite the Trust to reconsider whether the form could be improved to reduce the risk of inadequate or insufficient information being provided which may result in a delay in care. 6"

On the 25 April 2019 I concluded Brad's Inquest. I found that the medical cause of death was 1a) Hanging. In box 3 in the Record of Inquest I recorded how, when and where Brad came by his death as follows:- At some point after 1541 on Wednesday 10 January 2018 Bradley hanged himself by the neck at his home in Durrington, Wiltshire. He was discovered at around 1640 and despite advanced life support measures was confirmed as having died at 1812 at Salisbury District Hospital in Wiltshire the same day. Having considered the evidence I felt that there was insufficient evidence to make a finding of fact that on a balance of probabilities that Brad had intended to take his life at that time and I therefore recorded as a conclusion one of - Accident. Such a conclusion is recorded were a finding is made that someone has died, as in Brad's case, as a result of an unintended consequence of a deliberate act.","It is fair to say that all unnatural deaths generally speaking are tragic but in the case of Brad it is even more tragic because Brad was a schoolboy and at the time of his death was aged 13. HavinQ left school for the day on Wednesday 10 January 2018, Brad was subsequently found by Wiltshire & Swindon Coroner's Office, 26 Endless Street, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SPl lDP Tel 01722 438900 I Fax 01722 332223 5 his younger sister suspended from the bannister at his home in Durrington in Wiltshire at approximately at 1640 the same day. At about an hour earlier he had lnstagrammed a friend in respect of which he was aware that a school friend of his had spoken to a teacher earlier that day and he was hopeful that he would get some support and help. A couple of Brad friends had become increasingly concerned for Brad especially following their return to school about a week earlier and had spoken to the Head of Year that morning. I was satisfied having heard the evidence that an immediate risk of harm was not conveyed to the Head of Year and in fact one of the students who spoke with the teacher in evidence indicated that he personally did not think that Brad would go through with his actions and take his own life. The evidence was clear that shortly before the return to school, for the Spring term, that Brad's outlook had changed and when talking about self-harm and suicide Brad's tone took a more serious nature and this ultimately was of concern to his friends. As I sure you are aware communication these days is not simply face to face and in the digital age there are many internet based communication platforms that people, especially young persons, use to communicate and one of those platforms was Discord and before returning to school Brad appeared to be expressing thoughts of taking his own life and this continued whilst gaming following their return to school. He actually indicated that he had made an attempt 2 days earlier but his friends for fear that their parents would ban them from using their electronic equipment did not communicate this to anybody. What was apparent from the evidence was that Brad was becoming increasingly aware of the concept of suicide and exploring methods. There was evidence that pointed to him if not directly viewing the video footage taken by (You Tuber) of a Japanese Forest where people hang themselves, that he did enter and view discussions on the subject and also entered other discussions boards such as Reddit where suicide was being advocated for and advocated against and where methods were being discussed. It was clear to me that Brad was developing an unhealthy interest in relation to the concept of suicide and the means to achieve one's own death. The reason why I did not return a suicide conclusion was primarily having regard to the lnstagram message that Brad sent to his friend approximately an hour before he was found which did not point to an immediate risk of death and no note was left at the time. I found more likely than not that Brad was experimenting with the method, however, it is not commonly known that having placed an ligature around ones neck that it can compress nerves and blood vessels that can lead to unconsciousness in a matter of seconds and unless there is somebody there to cut you down the likely outcome is death. CORONE~SCONCERNS It will come as no surprise that my concern here relates to the internet and the regulation of it. Brad had access to the worldwide web however as with other cases that I am sure you are aware of that have been highlighted of late, my concern here is that some of the material Brad was exposed to was of a nature that a young person of his age should not be exposed to as they cannot, in my view, properly assimilate and process the information that they view. The amount of information on the subject of self-harm and suicide that is currently available to young persons on the internet goes beyond freedom of expression and I am concerned that the extent of such information Normalises actions which at the end of the day are simply not normal. It is not normal to self-harm and it is not normal to perform an act which results in that person's own death. I fully appreciate that the responsibility does not rest solely with Parliament, but the control of this entity has to start somewhere although I fully accept that to counter such activity will involve the combined efforts of Parliament, internet service providers, internet site owner, schools and colleges, parents/guardians as well as the young person's themselves. I can take judicial notice of when I was growing up that I do not recall ever discussing self-harm and suicide in the same way as it is discussed now, and I fear that the abundance of this type of information and the ease of its accessibility is leading to this concept of Normalisation of such actions. Yes, it is totally riqht that we should be open about mental health issues but the Wiltshire & Swindon Coroner's Office, 26 Endless Street, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SPl lDP Tel 01722 438900 I Fax 01722 332223 6 7 8 9 abundance of information that is out there on self-harming and suicide methods is a step too far hence my concern.

HavinQ left school for the day on Wednesday 10 January 2018, Brad was subsequently found by Wiltshire & Swindon Coroner's Office, 26 Endless Street, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SPl lDP Tel 01722 438900 I Fax 01722 332223 5 his younger sister suspended from the bannister at his home in Durrington in Wiltshire at approximately at 1640 the same day. At about an hour earlier he had lnstagrammed a friend in respect of which he was aware that a school friend of his had spoken to a teacher earlier that day and he was hopeful that he would get some support and help. A couple of Brad friends had become increasingly concerned for Brad especially following their return to school about a week earlier and had spoken to the Head of Year that morning. I was satisfied having heard the evidence that an immediate risk of harm was not conveyed to the Head of Year and in fact one of the students who spoke with the teacher in evidence indicated that he personally did not think that Brad would go through with his actions and take his own life. The evidence was clear that shortly before the return to school, for the Spring term, that Brad's outlook had changed and when talking about self-harm and suicide Brad's tone took a more serious nature and this ultimately was of concern to his friends. As I sure you are aware communication these days is not simply face to face and in the digital age there are many internet based communication platforms that people, especially young persons, use to communicate and one of those platforms was Discord and before returning to school Brad appeared to be expressing thoughts of taking his own life and this continued whilst gaming following their return to school. He actually indicated that he had made an attempt 2 days earlier but his friends for fear that their parents would ban them from using their electronic equipment did not communicate this to anybody. What was apparent from the evidence was that Brad was becoming increasingly aware of the concept of suicide and exploring methods. There was evidence that pointed to him if not directly viewing the video footage taken by (You Tuber) of a Japanese Forest where people hang themselves, that he did enter and view discussions on the subject and also entered other discussions boards such as Reddit where suicide was being advocated for and advocated against and where methods were being discussed. It was clear to me that Brad was developing an unhealthy interest in relation to the concept of suicide and the means to achieve one's own death. The reason why I did not return a suicide conclusion was primarily having regard to the lnstagram message that Brad sent to his friend approximately an hour before he was found which did not point to an immediate risk of death and no note was left at the time. I found more likely than not that Brad was experimenting with the method, however, it is not commonly known that having placed an ligature around ones neck that it can compress nerves and blood vessels that can lead to unconsciousness in a matter of seconds and unless there is somebody there to cut you down the likely outcome is death. CORONE~SCONCERNS It will come as no surprise that my concern here relates to the internet and the regulation of it. Brad had access to the worldwide web however as with other cases that I am sure you are aware of that have been highlighted of late, my concern here is that some of the material Brad was exposed to was of a nature that a young person of his age should not be exposed to as they cannot, in my view, properly assimilate and process the information that they view. The amount of information on the subject of self-harm and suicide that is currently available to young persons on the internet goes beyond freedom of expression and I am concerned that the extent of such information Normalises actions which at the end of the day are simply not normal. It is not normal to self-harm and it is not normal to perform an act which results in that person's own death. I fully appreciate that the responsibility does not rest solely with Parliament, but the control of this entity has to start somewhere although I fully accept that to counter such activity will involve the combined efforts of Parliament, internet service providers, internet site owner, schools and colleges, parents/guardians as well as the young person's themselves. I can take judicial notice of when I was growing up that I do not recall ever discussing self-harm and suicide in the same way as it is discussed now, and I fear that the abundance of this type of information and the ease of its accessibility is leading to this concept of Normalisation of such actions. Yes, it is totally riqht that we should be open about mental health issues but the Wiltshire & Swindon Coroner's Office, 26 Endless Street, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SPl lDP Tel 01722 438900 I Fax 01722 332223 6 7 8 9 abundance of information that is out there on self-harming and suicide methods is a step too far hence my concern."

The Medical Director, The Sheffield Children's Hospital 2. The Chief Executive, The Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), Sheffield 1","On 9th March 2018, I commenced an investigation into the death of Aryan Akhgar aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25th January 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was: Narrative Conclusion Aryan Akghar died on 06.03.18 in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield following an incident on 16.02.18 when he hanged himself from a self‐administered ligature with the intent to take his own life. Aryan's death occurred against a background of four serious attempts to take his own life on 03.01.18, 06.01.18, 09.01.18 and 11.01.18. Aryan was assessed on 09.01.18 by specialists from the Adult Mental Health Trust in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield and discharged home to his family. That assessment recommended an urgent response and visit the next day by the Home Treatment Team. The Home Treatment Team declined the referral because Aryan was under 18. The STAR team in CAMHS did not at that time provide an urgent response service. The first visit by mental health professionals to Aryan therefore was not until 15.01.18 because of this gap in provision. Aryan was seen by the STAR Deliberate Self Harm team on 15.01.18, 21.01.18 and 03.02.18 and was then discharged. Aryan then hanged himself on 16.02.18. 4","Please see the narrative conclusion set out in box 3. Aryan's medical cause of death was due to hanging. All witnesses accepted that there was a gap in services for Aryan and, notwithstanding the evidence of the Medical Director of the Sheffield Children's Hospital, I remained concerned that difficulties in securing funding might jeopardise his proposed solution. 5","The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows: 5.1 A gap in services was identified for 16 and 17 years old's with urgent mental health issues, such as Aryan had. On 9th January 2018, Aryan was assessed as requiring urgent mental health input, commencing the next day. This was not available as a service for under 18's in Sheffield and Aryan did not receive any contact from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) until 15th January 2018. In evidence I was told that additional resources in the CAMHS service were close to agreement in order to prevent this kind of problem arising in the future. However, this would be subject to a commissioning process from the Clinical Commissioning Group for Sheffield which could not be guaranteed. 5.2 It was accepted in evidence by the Medical Director of the Sheffield Children's Hospital on behalf of CAMHS that such additional resource was required. The delivery of the necessary funding to properly resource the CAMHS team was not guaranteed. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16/01/2019. The conclusion of the inquest was: Ellie Long took action to end her own life. The evidence does not reveal whether she intended to die.

The medical cause of death was:
1a Hypoxic Brain Injury
1b Cardiac Arrest
1c Hanging
II Anorexia, Depression","Ellie Long was receiving treatment in the community from the Eating Disorder Service. She was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa and Depression. On the morning of 10 December 2017, Miss Long went to her bedroom, where she was found hanging later that morning. Emergency Services were called, and Miss Long was taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where she died on 12 December 2017.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. These were dealt with by way of written representations submitted on behalf of IPs. Some of the concerns raised have been dealt with and I propose taking no further action. However, as indicated in Court today, in my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The matters of concern are as follows:

1. Record keeping and Auditing of Record keeping

a) Not all records were properly recorded on Lorenzo. Further, personal handwritten notes were made of some meetings which were not then reflected in the electronic records. Some of these notes only came to light during the inquest hearing. It is, of course, imperative that all staff recognise their obligations in respect of keeping full and contemporaneous electronic records and that full disclosure of all relevant documents is made in a timely fashion before the inquest commences. This avoids potential delay in the inquest process and further distress to the family.

b) Some action has been taken by NSFT in this respect, not least in that the team is now better resourced staff-wise. Further action has been and is being taken to ensure staff appreciate the importance of full record keeping. An audit of the records has been undertaken to ensure full compliance with record keeping requirements but this will only continue until 100% compliance has been achieved.

c) Concern remains in that staff do change over time and matters raised now do not necessarily remain at the forefront of an individual's mind, especially when under time pressure. Good record keeping is an integral part of any good service and must be second nature to all staff. It must be fully appreciated by all as ""a vital component in the management of risk"". Further, record keeping has been raised elsewhere as a matter of concern within NSFT.

d) I have concern that full record keeping and disclosure requirements will not remain a priority.

2. Communication with External Agencies

a) An initial full, updating letter was sent to Ellie's GP. However no further updating information was sent. A letter was written providing updating information, but this was not sent. No further updating information was sent to the GP by telephone, letter or email.

b) The evidence heard is that efforts were made to contact the school by telephone. However, the school had no record of any such calls. There is no evidence of email or written correspondence or further telephone calls in an effort to communicate with the school.

c) It is accepted by the Trust that sharing of relevant information is necessary. NSFT has indicated it will ""remind staff of the importance of recording efforts to share information/maintain communication"".

d) Sharing of information and communication with external agencies is a matter which has been raised with NSFT on previous occasions. The importance of ""recording efforts to share information ..."" may not be sufficient to prevent future deaths. It is the importance of sharing information and communicating with external agencies that should be addressed here. Recording of information is dealt with at Point 1 above."

Chief Executive Calderdale Council","On 30/1/18 I opened an inquest into the death of Ursula Niamh MacEochaigh Keogh who, at the date of her death was aged 11 years old.
The inquest was resumed and concluded on 15/11/18
I found that the cause of death to be: -
1a. Head injury
1b Fall from a height

I arrived at a narrative conclusion as follows:
On 22/1/18 Ursula Niamh MacEochaigh Keogh intended to take her own life.","On 22/1/18 Ursula left her school at Lightcliffe Academy and boarded the school bus in company with her friend. At approximately 3.30pm Ursula got off a stop earlier than usual and made her way to the North Bridge in Halifax from which she jumped. She was subsequently located at 6.20am in the river approximately 100 yards away from the Shears Inn Public House, 2km downstream from the North Bridge. When Ursula was retrieved from the waters paramedics found that she had very sadly passed away and this was confirmed at the hospital.","During the inquest I heard that Ursula's mother contacted Ursula's GP at spring Hall Medical Centre by telephone on 13/11/17 in order to discuss her concerns about Ursula's history of self-harm and that this resulted in her mother being advised by a GP to get Ursula's school involved. Although the school subsequently advised Ursula's mother to contact her GP, during the telephone conversation of 14/12/17 to further discuss Ursula's self-harming, the GP advised her mother to contact the Psychology Team attached to the school, so that Ursula could be assessed for referral to Child & Adolescent Mental Health Team if necessary, in accord with the protocol previously issued by Calderdale CAMHS referral pathway, notwithstanding that at this time the school did not have the services of a Psychology team to make the referral.

I further heard helpful evidence from [REDACTED] Highway Asset Manager, Calderdale Council), who told me about the current plans for preventative measures at North Bridge, Halifax in order to deter further like tragedies.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows: -

 To review the current practice of referral by GP to the school for consideration as to the appropriateness of referral to CAHMS
 Consider improving communications between professionals, particularly health and education to eliminate contradictions offered in the advice.
 Consider the appropriateness of fast tracking the implementation of preventative measures currently under consideration at North Bridge Halifax"

Ben had little involvement with any services at the time of his death. Bury Safeguarding Childrens Board have undertaken a Serious Case review into previous contact and a number of learning points arise from this.
However during the course of the Inquest evidence was heard on one specific issue which I am of the opinion needs to be addressed in order to prevent future deaths. Details of this are set out below.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
During the course of the investigation into Bens death it emerged that on a number of days in the month prior to his death he had searched on the school (St Phillips Secondary school) computers ""how to kill myself "", ""how to tie a noose"" and "" why I shouldn't commit suicide"".
It was explained to the Court that the school filters are accessed via Smoothwall which provides age appropriate filtered content. Whilst Ben could not access these pages as they were blocked , there was no mechanism in place at the time for the school to be made aware that a pupil may have attempted to search for such pages.
The Court heard evidence that at the time of Ben's death the only monitoring was in lessons and was solely reliant on the teacher trying to watch what students were doing. The school has 900 pupils and the Court heard in any one day there can be 12,000 attempts by pupils to access blocked content. Not all of these would be as concerning as the content Ben was trying to access, some may relate to social media pages which the school does not allow.
Evidence was provided to the Court that since Ben's death, Smoothwall have now upgraded functionality and staff now receive notifications when blocked high risk safeguarding categories are attempting to be accessed.
These alerts are ""real time"" notifications and go to three identified members of staff. Since this installation staff have been notified of two other children attempting to access similar sites to Ben and have taken action to speak to them and also to speak to their parents to offer support.
However it is not known if this functionality is mandatory for all schools or indeed whether other software providers who are used by schools have this option.
If schools do not have this facility you may wish to consider disseminating this information, this is of course a matter for yourself."

[REDACTED] CNWL CCG Chair Central & North West London NHS Foundation Trust HQ Stephenson House 75 Hampstead Road London. NW1 2PL","On the 3rd October 2018, evidence was heard touching the death of Maximilien Conrad Kohler. Max had been found deceased hanging by a belt around his neck from a pull-up bar positioned across his bedroom door at his home address. He was 15 years old at the time of his death. The findings of the court were as follows:

Medical Cause of Death

1 (a) Fatal pressure to the neck

How, when and where the deceased came by his death:

Max suffered with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Syndrome. At times symptoms of ASD would overwhelm him and he would attempt to take his own life or self-harm. On 5/5/2018 he was found hanging by his father at his home address. Despite resuscitation his life could not be saved and he was recognised as life extinct at 07:23. He had left 2 messages expressing intent and demonstrating capacity.

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death:

He took his own life whilst suffering from Autistic Spectrum Disorder","Evidence taken at the inquest confirmed that Max had not been diagnosed with ASD until he saw a third and very experienced Child and Adult Psychiatrist, at least in part because Max was clever and able to cross compensate for the issues that the ASD caused him and instead had been incorrectly diagnosed with depression and bulimia nervosa, of which there was no evidence when he was assessed at length in an inpatient setting. These diagnoses had at least in part been arrived at by the use of questionnaires. Expert evidence was taken and accepted by the court that the earlier misdiagnosis may have been contributed to by the latest fashion in mental health to over rely on questionnaires and perhaps less upon clinical evaluation of the whole picture presented by the patient. It is possible that such over-reliance can contribute to misdiagnoses and underestimate risk.

The over reliance on the use of questionnaires to assess the risk of self-harm, compared to full psychiatric history taking and evaluation of the patient in the round by a clinician with experience has been a repeated theme in inquests.

It was also discussed and accepted by the court that the current training regime for the training of specialist doctors is shorter that it was in the past so that doctors now become consultants with far less experience at senior registrar level, and consequently less exposure to and skill with diagnostics across the range of psychiatric conditions.

Further it was discussed and accepted by the court that there is a relative paucity of services for conditions which are chronic and difficult to treat and cure compared to illnesses which respond to short term therapies, and so show easily auditable improvements in health with the application of evidence based guidance.

This was considered by the expert and accepted by the court to reflect the style of commissioning of care by CCGs who wish to support and prioritise the services to relatively easily treatable conditions.

ASD was accepted to be a lifelong incurable condition which responds only to long term supportive care, and so to have expensive and resource rich treatment requirements. As such ASD would come towards the bottom of the pile for CCG commissioned treatment and care.

The expert stated that care provision is even worse for adults with ASD and other similar conditions than for children.

Max's parents gave extensive evidence in relation to the support and information that they have received since his suicide compared to the time when they were trying to care for him whilst he was alive. They described a lacuna in support and educational provision for parents attempting to assist a child with ASD.

When Max needed urgent in patient admission there was no bed available in London in Child and Adolescent psychiatric services, and if his parents had not been able to access private health care he would have needed to have been hospitalised in Sheffield.

A report from CNWL, accepted by the court, stated that a new facility is currently being built to provide psychiatric beds for children and adolescents in West London, but this cannot alone address the scarcity of provision across the rest of London and England.","1. That delays in diagnosis and misdiagnosis in medicine due to reduced time in training for doctors in general and psychiatry in particular, may imperil the lives of vulnerable patients.

2. That over reliance in the current fashion on questionnaires used in diagnostics and management may impede rather than assist doctors and other clinicians, firstly to arrive at the correct diagnosis in the first place, and secondly to cause or contribute to underestimation or proper evaluation of the risk of self -harm in particular.

3. That the NHS care commissioning structure is biased against the commissioning of services for chronic incurable conditions in general and ASD in particular.

4. That there is a lack of support and education available for parents caring for children with ASD.

5. That there is a severe shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for children and adolescents in the NHS.

6. That services for adults with ASD are even less well provided for by the NHS than those for children."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12/04/2018. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,"Several years before her death, Katy was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, PTSD with a history of Anxiety, Depression and an eating disorder and was under the care of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) at SLAM at the time of her death. In around May 2017, the care plan that had been formulated and notified to Katy in writing was significantly altered. Although this change was communicated orally to Katy and her family, it was not confirmed in writing and little, if any opportunity was provided to appeal this decision to alter Katy's care plan, despite the family's increasing concerns over its appropriateness for Katy. Consequently, at the time of her death Katy was under a care plan believed by the family to be unsuitable for her, thereby exacerbating a breakdown of trust on the part of Katy's family in the service provided by CAMHS/SLAM and creating a lack of provision for care or advice when a crisis, due to unexpected circumstances arose.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern, although many of these were addressed in an investigative report prepared by SLAM. However, in my opinion a continued failure to clearly communicate changes to a care plan and provide a clear route to challenging or appealing these changes, together with the provision of details of all avenues for seeking emergency and non-emergency care and advice, create a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) Failure to communicate in writing a Care Plan and changes to it.

North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group. 3. Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group. 4. Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.,"On 12th April 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karen Jane Edgar. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13th April 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was Karen was suffering from emotional and behavioural issues and was referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in October 2015, aged 15. Her first substantive meeting with her mental health practitioner was on 8th February, 2016, when family work was planned. She did not start individual talking therapy until 7th April. Family therapy had ceased to be available. After only one more 1:1 session on 25th April she was, on 5th May, seen by a psychiatrist who prescribed fluoxetine-10mg. In July it was increased to 20mg. On 29th September she took an overdose of paracetamol, then raised the alarm and received inpatient general hospital attention. Her true intention was not clear. The psychiatrist changed her medication to sertraline 50mg which commenced on about 7th March 2017, after only twelve 1:1 sessions. On 22nd March she was involved in an outburst at school relating to her boyfriend, from whom she had split in February. At the 1:1 on 29th March she was angry and upset and later that day researched 'suicide note' on the internet. Sertraline was increased to 100mg on 30th March. She had convinced herself she was pregnant and told her former boyfriend on 1st April. She admitted to a friend having tried to hang herself. On the evening of 7th April she had an angry exchange with her former boyfriend over the pregnancy issue via text and went home. Whilst her parents were not in the house she hanging herself from a dressing gown cord in a wardrobe in her bedroom. She was discovered soon afterwards, but despite medical treatment did not recover and was pronounced dead at West Cumberland Hospital at 01.10 hours on 8th April. She had made a cut in the ligature with a pair of scissors.
Medical cause: Hanging.

Conclusion: Misadventure; she hanged herself as a gesture intending to be discovered.","Karen had been displaying behavioural and anger problems for many months when there was a major incident in August 2015 which resulted in her and her parents seeking help. Despite a referral to CAMHS in October 2015 assessment appointments did not take place until early December and January. Family work was proposed but only two meetings took place before it ceased to be available. Karen did not start 1:1 work until April 2016, nearly six months from first seeing her GP. She only had 13 talking sessions from the first assessment in December 2015 until her death in April 2017. The psychiatrist diagnosed her with moderately severe depressive disorder and prescribed antidepressants after only two 1:1 sessions. (NICE suggests 4-6 sessions). She was not monitored closely on four drug changes. It remains an open question as to whether the introduction of sertraline a month before is implicated in her death. Whilst the mental health worker did her level best it seems that the resources were inadequate to support Karen and she received sub-optimal care. The Trust's own report revealed a long list of failings including:- no care plan; lack of 'packages of care'; gaps in work force and skills base; absence of family therapy; failure to re-assess risk formally; lack of Multi-disciplinary Meetings; absence of holistic approach and not engaging more productively with her school. Many of these issues were themes found to be endemic in the Trust by the CQC in its report of 26th January 2018.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) The provision of mental health services for children and young people in Cumbria is underfunded.
(2) There are long delays in getting treatment.
(3) Failure to provide for these young people means they risk entering adulthood with unresolved mental health issues.
(4) Lives are lost and damaged; including the effect on families as a whole.
(5) The financial cost to the state of such deaths is huge; 4 paramedics attended as did an out of hours doctor; at least 11 police staff; hospital staff; A&E consultant; Local Safeguarding processes; costs of inquests and Trust's legal representation etc. all of which would be better spent on prevention.
(6) It is likely that any of these problems are replicated across the country hence the reference to the Secretary for State."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13th December 2017.

The medical cause of death was given as:

1a Hanging

The conclusion was:

Accidental death contributed to by neglect","Rebecca Romero died on 19th July 2017 at her home address. She had been found in the bathroom with a ligature around her neck and she died from the injuries sustained. Rebecca had been discharged from a psychiatric unit on 14th July 2017 and was under the care of the community team at the time of her death. She had not been seen since her discharge.

Rebecca had a long history of self harm and mental health problems; she was described as appearing very vulnerable with very few factors of resilience. In June 2016 she began using ligaturing as a means of self harm. It was agreed by a number of witnesses that that elevated Becky's risk.

On 10th June 2017 she was admitted to Pebble Lodge Adolescent Unit in Dorset as there were no beds for her in the local area of Bristol at the Unit called Riverside.

On 6th July she was released for a period of leave; what in fact transpired was she never returned to Pebble Lodge after this period of leave.

On 14th July there was a discharge meeting and a community care package was put into place.

I was told that the original plan was to arrange to transfer Becky to Riverside but as there was no place available attempts were made to discharge her to Riverside as a day placement patient. Unfortunately there were no day placements available either and therefore a community care package was put into place. One witness described the community care package as ""it just didn't feel very comfortable.""

Furthermore the evidence at the inquest from NHS England was at the time of Becky's discharge that a day patient placement was available at Riverside.

An independent witness also gave evidence at the inquest and said he was concerned about the length of time that Becky was without a medical review and that post discharge was at a very high risk time. He stated that the amount of contact from the 6th July to the time of her death was not acceptable and that the plan to see Becky once a week following her discharge was not sufficient.

A number of other points were raised at the inquest as follows:
 In relation to the transfer from Pebble Lodge to Riverside it appears that a Form 1 was submitted to Riverside on 15th June but that the referral was closed on 6th July. There appeared to be confusion by some as to whether this was being followed up.
 The community care plan that was in place from 14th July had no dates for tasks to be completed or for meetings to take place, by way of example at the time of her death a medical review appointment was still not in the diary.
 Different people described Becky's risks in different ways, terminology such as low, medium or high were used to describe her risk but others used significant or low and even on the date of discharge her risks were described in different ways.
 Part of the care plan was for there to be communication by text with Becky up until the time of her death there was only one text sent which was effectively confirming an appointment for after her death and simply stating ""how are you"". I was told that there is no current training or guidance given to staff.
 This case highlighted some of the difficulties in transferring children to an in-patient unit out of the area and then arranging to transfer them back to the area.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) In this case there was confusion as to whether on an in-patient transfer there should be a Form 2 to go alongside the Form 1 procedure. As well as clarifying this process with all providers concerned consideration should be given that a clear documented process is put in place for in-patient transfers so that all those involved understand clearly the situation and the decision made in relation to the patient.

(2) Consideration should be given to ensuring that all care plans are time specific so that dates of meetings or dates for tasks to be completed are set at the time of the meeting so again expectations are managed and everyone knows exactly what the plan is and when actions will occur.

(3) That the issue of inconsistent terminology when assessing risk is reviewed to ensure a consistent approach. In this case there were a number of different phrases and grading's used to determine the deceased's risk.

(4) That consideration should be given to training and/or guidance issued for staff communicating with young persons by text or any means of social media.

(5) Consideration should be given to reviewing whether there ought to be guidance issued when managing children who go out of area for psychiatric in patient care and further guidance issued in the management of children when returning to their local area when they have been an in-patient out of area. Whether certain steps should be taken to ensure best practice and a consistent approach e.g. risk assessing; face to face meetings; robust care planning; parental involvement; how best to re-integrate back into the local area/team."

Mr Neil Carr OBE The Chief Executive of South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Trust Trust Headquarters St George's Hospital Corporation Street Stafford ST16 3SR 1,"On 31st January 2017 1 commenced an investigation into the death of Jeff David ANTWIS, 14 years of age. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9th November 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. 4",On Monday 30th January 2017 at approximately 05:30 hours a train travelling south along the railway line at Harlescott level crossing Shrewsbury struck the deceased causing serious head injuries. He was transferred by ambulance to the Royal Stoke University Hospital where at 17:18 hours he was confirmed dead. The deceased was a vulnerable teenager with a diagnosis of asperger's syndrome with a history of self-harm escalating to suicide attempts. In answers to a miracle question he indicated that he wished to die. An urgent medical review was appropriate but not carried out however it cannot be said to have caused or contributed to the death. 5,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Following an urgent referral by Jeff's GP to (the then) Shropshire CAMHS on the 10th January 2017 a timely response was made with an initial appointment with a mental health practitioner taking place on the 12th. A further appointment was arranged for the 25th January (an earlier date clashed with an existing medical appointment) and in the meantime Jeff was given a miracle question to complete. (2) Jeff answered the miracle question indicating that he wished to die. He passed it to his mother who immediately contacted the mental health practitioner who in turn referred it and the initial assessment to a consultant physiatrist for review. The consultant physiatrist did not consider the matter urgent and arranged for a routine medical review for the 17th March 2017. (3) At the second meeting on the 25th January 2017 Jeff and his mother were informed of the appointment for the 17th March 2017. Jeff's mother immediately raised concerns and asked for it to be brought forward. She was told she would have to write in and make a complaint. This was a time sensitive situation adding to the problem without resolving it. (4) On the 30th January 2017 Jeff killed himself on the railway line. (5) Independent expert evidence from a child and adolescent consultant physiatrist indicated that Jeff should have been offered an urgent medical review appointment for the 27th January 2017 (i.e. within 7 days of the internal referral to the consultant physiatrist) and not, as a routine appointment, the 17th March 2017. It cannot be said that such earlier appointment would have addressed Jeff's problems and altered his wish to die but it is it possible that earlier intervention may have lifted his spirits and not, according to his mother, 'wilted'. It undoubtedly would have helped and at least been an earlier step in seeking to help Jeff. (6) Other matters of concern arose from the evidence. The mental health practitioner: a) Was aware of the deliberate self-harm protocol but not its content. b) Carried out a risk assessment on a subjective basis without reference to any known definition e.g. serious or significant. c) Had no mechanism for referring back to the consultant physiatrist appointment, whether she agreed with the request or not. (7) As stated Jeff had a diagnosis of asperger's syndrome with autistic spectrum disorder. Concerns were raised to what extent these conditions have may have masked Jeff's suicidal ideation on presentation and to what extent, if it is the case, they were recognized. (8) From evidence given at the inquest it is clear that the provision of child and adolescent mental health service is in transition, having moved from Shropshire CAMHS to part of South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Trust. Certain actions are already being taken and these concerns are raised so that a holistic approach can be taken and fed in to what is already an ongoing wider review. 6"

Sofia was aged 14 years when she died on 26th September 2016. The medical cause of death was hanging. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, that on 20th September 2016 at 25 Saxon Way, Cheddar, Sofia deliberately suspended herself by the neck with the intention of ending her life.","Sofia had previously suffered from low mood. In Year 8 both school and family noticed significant changes in Sofia's behaviour, including self-harming. Sofia's mother was sufficiently concerned to attend the family G.P. who wrote to CAMHS West supporting a referral from Sofia's school. By letter dated 2nd April 2015 CAMHS West stated that Sofia's difficulties did not meet criteria for specialist CAMHS intervention.

In February 2016 Sofia attended her G.P. with her mother, Sofia's hair was starting to break, her self-confidence fell as her hair became thinner. Sofia and her mother returned to the G.P. a number of times and in June 2016 the G.P. agreed if Sofia was stressed, it was documented that Sofia has been low for months, was self-harming again but denied any suicidal thoughts. Following an attendance at the G.P. on 12th July 2016 it was noted that Sofia has expressed some suicidal thoughts. An expert referral was made to CAMHS West. Sofia was seen by a care-co-ordinator at CAMHS West on 15th July 2016 and again on 29th July 2016. Sofia was given the opportunity to speak to the care coordinator alone. Sofia was placed on a 6 month waiting list for CBT. Sofia appeared to her mother to have a good summer holiday but upon returning to school in September 2016 Sofia started to isolate herself. Sofia's mother arranged an appointment with Sofia's care coordinator at CAMHS on 19th September 2016. Again Sofia had the chance to speak to the care co-ordinator alone and again Sofia admitted to suicidal thoughts. From the evidence of the care co-ordinator and Sofia's mother it was identified that there was a difference in recollection of what was discussed and expressed at that meeting. Matters that the care coordinator identified as discussed were not subsequently identified in Sofia's care plan, the care co-ordinator has no urgent contact with Sofia's school and no urgent contact with a psychiatrist. No follow up appointment was made. On the following day 26th September 2016 Sofia's mother following discussions with Sofia attended work and upon return home discovered Sofia hanging. Sofia left an apologetic 'suicide note'.","1. Access to CAMHS. Sofia was rejected for referral in April 2015. Might a lower threshold and earlier proactive interventionist policy has been of positive benefits to Sofia.
2. Availability of CBT. Sofia was placed on a 6 month waiting list for CBT. This delay appears considerable.
3. Sofia's care co-ordinator at CAMHS did not obtain the urgent input of a psychiatrist in accordance with NICE guidance.
4. The recollections of Sofia's care co-ordinator and Sofia's mother as to the meeting of the 19th September were at odds with each other. Sofia's care co-ordinator recollected in her evidence telling Sofia's mother that Sofia was not to be left alone. Sofia's mother deemed the impression from Sofia's care co-ordinator's evidence was of Sofia being an extremely vulnerable and dangerous position abut this was not reflected in Sofia's care plan which made no mention of her not being left alone and it was not reflected in the care co-ordinator's actions in not urgently contacting Sofia's school, where she would be during the following days to a psychiatrist. Her care plan appears to be the critical written record of the outcomes of this meeting as it was not of sufficient detail to safeguard Sofia.
5. Language used in the SIRI Report was felt to be inappropriate. The SIRI Report effectively said if the care plan had been followed the outcome might have been different and that no change in clinical practice would have resulted in any different outcome. I do not believe either of these statements were true."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 31 August 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide. Brandon was discovered hanging by a scarf around his neck from a hook in his wardrobe by police who had been called to his home address on the 09 August 2016. He was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary initially but was then transferred to the Glenfield Hospital, Leicester where he died on the 10 August 2016. He had been receiving treatment from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service at the time of his death for low mood and anxiety. Brandon was last seen face to face by one of the treating team on the 31 May 2016 and the final contact with him was on the 03 August 2016. Cause of Death was:- 1a) Severe Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy 1 b) Strangulation by hanging 4","In April 2105 Brandon refused to go to school and became more and more reclusive and anxious. He was taken to the GP by his mum and he was entered into the care of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. He was diagnosed with low mood and anxiety and was treated with fluoxetine. His mental health continued to deteriorate and he refused to engage with any professionals tasked with trying to assist him. His mother went to his mental health appointments alone without her son and the majority of the contact with either her or Brandon was by telephone. At times she managed to get him into the car but when they arrived at the appointment he absolutely refused to get out of the car in order to see the clinician due to his anxieties. Appointments were made appropriately by health care staff but contact with him by health professionals was via occasional telephone calls, when he agreed to speak to them. The last face to face contact with any member of the health care team was on the 31 May 2016 and his suicide occurred on the 09 August 2016. It was established that the efficacy of his care was compromised because of this lack of contact but Brandon was simply too anxious to attend out patients appointments and there was no provision or funding for the clinicians to o to Brandon's home to treat him. 5",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I heard at inquest that no member of the team on Roman Ward contacted Fallon's social worker. There was no protocol for this. If they had sought a collateral history from the social worker, they would have discovered that Fallon's mum was not dead as Fallon had told them, but was alive and living in a hostel. The social worker had been rung by a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, but she was waiting to be invited to a ward round at Mile End Hospital and such invitation was never made. It seems unlikely that proper discussion with the social worker would have changed the outcome for Fallon, but it would have meant that valuable information would have been shared, and it would have meant that Fallon would have had the benefit of her social worker on hand upon discharge. This might be very important for another patient. 6"
2754,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/steffan-bonnot/,2017-0450,2017-07-14,Penelope Schofield,West Sussex,Ofsted,On 5th July 2017 I concluded the inquest into the death of Steffan Bonnot born 6th November 1988 (aged 17) who died on 1st January 2016. His Inquest was originally opened on 12th January 2016. The Conclusion that I reached at the Inquest was that Steffan committed Suicide. At the time of his death he was in the care of Brighton and Hove Local Authority.,"Steffan was a young man who has had spent a considerable amount of time in foster care and children's homes. He was due to move out of the Amicus Community Children's home and into another foster placement on 16th January 2016. It was clear from the evidence that he was concerned about leaving the Amicus Community and that he was anxious about whether or not the Foster Carers were fully appraised of his background. He had had a large number of Foster placements in the past many of which had broken down. The concerns he had about how much the Foster Carers knew caused him some anxiety.
On Friday 1st January 2016 Steffan was amongst a small group of children who attended the local cinema. This was a pre-arranged outing. On the return from the cinema Steffan's group, which consisted of two staff and another child, stopped off at MacDonalds. Shortly after arriving at MacDonalds Steffan and the other young man went to the Toilet. A member of staff followed them shortly afterwards and asked them to come out. Steffan did so but then left MacDonalds without saying anything. The staff tried to follow him and locate him. They were unable to do so and sadly Steffan body was later found at the Warningcamp footcrossing having been struck by a train. Steffan had deliberately knelt down in front of an oncoming train","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
1. The author of the serious case review reported that the prospective foster carers who were to offer a placement to Steffan had advised that they had not been made fully aware of all the background to Steffan's case. This was, however, at odds with what Steffan's Social worker told us. However there was no formal documentation detailing exactly what had been disclosed. It was not therefore possible to be clear what information the prospective Foster Carer had been given. As we know the failing to provide Foster Carers with all the background information was one of Steffan's major concerns and added to his level of anxiety about his move.
2. The above concern would apply equally to any individuals entrusted with the care of a child. All relevant information should be made available and it should be documented as to what has been provided so that the carers can make an informed decision before any placement is agreed. The young person could then be confident as to what the prospective carer's knew.

I consider that the issues raised in this case should be addressed so that future deaths do not occur in similar circumstances and that action should be taken to reduce the risk of deaths of other patients.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action by addressing these issues."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8/3/2017. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide and the cause of death 1a Asphyxia, 1b External airways obstruction.","The deceased had been anxious and suffering from low self-esteem for some time. She was concerned about her weight. There had been some recent family relationship difficulties and she experienced peer pressure at school relating to a stormy relationship that she had with her boyfriend. She had been referred to child and adult mental health services (CAMHS) in November 2015 by her GP but that referral was not accepted. She was referred again by her school on the 20th October 2016. The following day she had contact with the CAMHS team who offered her an appointment which she declined because of difficulty accessing the venue. On the 4th November 2016 the CAMHS team attempted unsuccessfully to contact the school referrer. On the same day her family perceived that she returned home from school unhappy. At about 1700 hours she went to her bedroom at her home address, [REDACTED] saying she had a migraine. At 1710 hours she received a text from her boyfriend saying he wished to end their relationship. At 1713 hours they spoke on the phone and she indicated to him that she was going to kill herself. At about 2200 hours her father went to her bedroom and found her on the bedroom floor with a plastic bag over her head tied underneath her chin. She was certified dead at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
(1) At the inquest it was evident that Annabel had been referred by her GP to your team in November 2015 but that referral had not been accepted. She was referred again on 20/10/2016 by her school. This time the referral was accepted and your team made contact with her by telephone on 21/10/2016. She declined an appointment because she felt she could not get to the venue. No level of risk was recorded and next of kin details were not available. The date of appointment offered and declined were not recorded. Alternative time for appointment was not recorded. No follow up arrangements were recorded.
There was no attempt to contact Annabel thereafter. An unsuccessful attempt to contact the referrer was made on 4/11/2016- the day Annabel took her own life.
The time period between referral and initial contact and attempted follow up appears considerable.
No attempt appears to have been made to engage with her parents who would have been in a position to assist with transport arrangements.
The expectation that young people such as Annabel would 'opt in 'to the system may be unrealistic given the difficulties that she had in engaging.
Annabel might well have benefitted had she been offered a more proactive service."

I recorded that the deceased on or around the 8th September 2015 at her home address had taken a quantity of medication which was prescribed to other family members. At the time she had a number of medical and social issues which were being investigated.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a) Acute Hypoxia due to 1b) Morphine overdose

Conclusion - Deceased had taken her own life","The Inquest into the death of Rachal Murphy heard how a number of agencies were involved with Rachal and her family. Rachal had not been attending school for a long period of time. She was being investigated for epilepsy and it was reported by her family that she was having seizures on a daily basis. These were not confirmed on any of the investigations undertaken.

By 2014 there were concerns by professionals as to both the underlying cause of any medical condition but also her lack of schooling, her lack of interaction and underlying stressors which may have been impacting on any medical condition.

There was also some evidence that she had attempted to self harm but this was denied by her family.
The Court heard that by March 2015 they were concerned that there was no counsellor involved with rachal. By this stage it was accepted by Rachals Consultant that there should have been a referral to Child Adolescent Mental health Services. The Court also heard that there was some confusion as to whether a direct referral could be made to the Clinical Psychology Services.

A CAF process had been commenced because of concerns about Rachal but there was a complete lack of progression for this process until the involvement of the Early Help Services. A meeting did take place on the 17th June 2015 but having heard the evidence the Court found that at best from March 2015 there was a fractured, disjointed plan as to how to proceed with Rachals care.

By the time of Rachals death there was a complete lack of action in respect of the plan for Rachal. Those involved with her medical care wanted input from Mental health services to whom no referral had been made. Those involved with her social matters had wanted an outcome on her medical conditions.","The concerns noted by the Court during the course of the Inquest are as follows:

GP SERVICES

1. There was a failure to undertake annual liver function tests in 2014 and 2015
2. The CAF documentation was completely overlooked and simply placed in the medical records as read only which led to no GP involvement in the inter-agency framework and handling of this case.

Tameside NHS FT and Pennine Care NHS FT

1. There was a lack of understanding between medical professionals as to the means by which someone could be referred to Psychological services and whether there was a unclear message from Psychological services as to whether they were accepting referrals.

2. Lack of understanding amongst medical professionals as to the cases which may or may not be suitable for referral to CAMHS.
3. There was as significant delay in the reporting of Rachals EEG and the Court heard that this remained the case in respect of reporting of EEGs at the time of the Inquest.

Tameside MBC - Early Help Services
1. The Court heard that there was a significant delay in the allocation of cases within Early Help Services and from the evidence the Court was not satisfied that this had been resolved."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21st September 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was that Christopher died from asphyxia due to acute upper airway obstruction. The circumstances in which he came by his death were recorded by the jury in a narrative form, as follows: Christopher suffered from mental illness and was a patient at Bethlem Adolescent Unit at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, Beckenham. He had a history of hearing voices, suicidal ideas, and self harm, usually by swallowing objects. On 31st August 2014 at about 8 pm, Christopher went to the communal toilet on the unit and obstructed his airway by swallowing the lid of a roll on deodorant wrapped in tissue paper. He called for help but suffered a cardiac arrest before the obstruction could be removed, and could not be resuscitated. Christopher's actions were in part because of cumulative and continuing failures in risk assessment and management. His death was contributed to by neglect.","Please see the narrative conclusion set out in paragraph 3, above","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) In respect of the in-patient management: that there was no separate policy or guidance, other than a pictorial wall chart, regarding the assessment and management of risks posed by items that might be used to cause self harm. The complexities of managing these risks on an adolescent in-patient psychiatric unit were not therefore adequately considered, and this led to a lack of clarity and consistency.

(2) With regard to resuscitation: the emergency equipment on the unit did not include a laryngoscope. The item obstructing Christopher's airway was subsequently used by ambulance personnel using Magill forceps with a laryngoscope, and this combination had been successfully used on a previous occasion when Christopher had swallowed a bottle top.

Laryngoscopes are not part of the standardised items on the unit, and are not included in the Resuscitation Council guidance for mental healthcare settings. It has been suggested that this is because they are complex devices that require intense training and competency assessments before staff can use them, and that it may be counterproductive to make them available. However, in view of the circumstances of Christopher's death, and the apparent prevalence of self harm in adolescent units, the matter is reported for consideration, both in relation to the laryngoscope itself and the access to staff trained in its use."

‘On the 4th April 2015 Joshua Harry Smith aged 16 years attended a party at a friend’s house, Joshua drank some alcohol, but was not drunk. He seemed fine when Joshua’s father collected him; arriving home at 00.30 a.m. on the 5th April 2015. At 02.15 a.m., Joshua contacted ambulance control by 999 call asking for an ambulance. He was below the cliffs near the southernmost part of Spittal Beach, (Northumberland) having fallen. Joshua had intended to jump from the cliff, then changed his mind, slipped and fell down the cliff to the bottom. Earlier text and Facebook messages showed that Joshua was thinking of taking his own life. After a prolonged search Joshua was eventually found clinging to a rock in the water at the base of the cliff at 04.01 a.m. There had been significant delays because Joshua’s first call to ambulance control advising his location as ‘Spittal’ was not heard until it was later played back, and while ambulance, police, fire and other agencies tried to locate Joshua. There was no indication that JESIP principles (Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Program) were followed regarding briefings or co-ordination of resources, and the Berwick ambulance crew felt that there was no search co-ordinator or person taking overall control. Other agencies did not feedback what resources they had committed to the incident. When Joshua was eventually located at 04.01 a.m., he lost his grip while holding onto a rock, and he was taken away from the shore by movement of the waves. An RAF Sea King helicopter by that time arrived and Joshua was winched out of the sea unconscious, and conveyed to Wansbeck General Hospital. Sadly Joshua’s death was confirmed at 06.15 a.m. at Wansbeck General Hospital.",As described in the above narrative.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

At 2.15 a.m. when Joshua made his 999 call he stated to Ambulance control that he had fallen from a cliff near Spittal Beach (which is on the south side of the River Tweed) and injured himself, that he was alone and was unable to walk.

Police and other emergency services were not immediately alerted from the outset of the information provided in Joshua’s telephone call to 999. Joshua’s location could not be identified from the mobile phone call made to 999.

Two Police Officers on Berwick Town Centre duties (which is north of the River Tweed) were asked in the street by paramedics for assistance in locating Joshua, and while paramedics went to look for Joshua on the north side of Berwick near the Holiday Park and cliffs, the police officers travelled to Spittal looking for Joshua although they had no name or further details at that time. A brief search of Spittal beach near to the cliffs by Police Officers was unsuccessful, before they returned to Town Centre duties. A report to Police Control was not made at that time.

The search for Joshua was briefly stood down after a North East Ambulance call to Joshua’s father indicated that Joshua was at home in his bedroom, without waiting for [REDACTED] to check and confirm whether Joshua was in fact in his bedroom.

The search for Joshua continued at Berwick Holiday Park (on the north side of the River Tweed and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed) as a result of his location at Spittal Beach not being recognised from his 999 call.

After Joshua’s phone call was ‘listened back’ it was observed that he had described his location as Spittal, at the bottom of a cliff, near Spittal beach.

Joshua had explained in his 999 call that he was below cliffs having fallen, was injured and that an ambulance would not be able to reach him. The Hazardous Area Response Team of North East Ambulance was not deployed to the incident until approximately 3 a.m. arriving at the scene under an hour later and were 1.5 miles away from the incident at the time Joshua was swept out to sea by action of the waves.

The circumstances of the incident showed that although there were examples of good co-operation and effort among the emergency services, overall command, control and co-ordination were unclear and JESIP was not followed."

The Jury determined that Amy had died from the complications arising from Hypoxic Ischaemic Brain damage following the tying of a ligature around her neck. The Jury return a narrative questionnaire in which they found that Amy's death had been contributed to by Neglect and they also found that there were a number of causative failures which led to her death. A copy of the narrative questionnaire is attached.","Amy El Keria was aged 14 years old at the material time. She had a range of complex needs associated with a number of mental health diagnoses. Up until the time of her hospital admission she lived with her mother and sister in Hounslow. Following her exclusion from school in early 2012 her mental health deteriorated and she started to ligature. In August 2012 she was seen for an emergency outpatient assessment and a planned inpatient admission was sought. However there were no specialist Child and Adolescent high dependency beds available immediately and Amy had to be admitted to the Priory Hospital at Roehampton. The following day she transferred to the Ticehurst House Hospital which is part of the Priory Group. During her stay at Ticehurst Amy's mental health fluctuated and at times she had to be forcefully restrained and sedated

On 12th November 2012, having told staff earlier in the day that she wanted to kill herself, she tied a ligature, namely a football scarf, around her neck and suspended herself from a radiator in her room. She subsequently died from her injuries the following day.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-

(1) The evidence given at the Inquest showed that there was a clear misapprehension by Hounslow Social Services as to their role in supporting Amy whilst at Ticehurst. It appears that Social services did not appreciate their important ongoing role to ensure Amy's welfare whilst placed at Ticehurst. [REDACTED] the Court expert, gave evidence that Hounslow may have seen this health funded placement as a stand-alone intervention that did not require their input.

(2) Social Services clearly have a vital role to play in ensuring family contact where a child is placed far from their family home where difficulties arise. There was no assessment carried out to assess whether there was any need to provide support to a child in need under Section 17 Children Act 1989 even when Amy's mother had specifically raised the difficulties she was having with contact with Amy , including the cost of travel, with her support worker.

(3) The family gave evidence to the extent that having better contact with Amy and more input into her care may have brought about a different outcome particularly when she was distressed.

I consider that the issues raised in this case should be addressed so that future deaths do not occur in similar circumstances and that action should be taken to reduce the risk of deaths of other children.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action by addressing these issues."

No. Were all appropriate persons notified to afford a proper opportunity to avoid future occurrences, such as the Acorn workshop staff? Answer. No. 2. ACCT Document. Was this fully completed with all relevant information? Answer. No. Did it accompany Liam on each occasion when he left the unit? Answer. No. Did it identify the relevant issues, needs and risks and adequately plan actions to resolve or reduce these? Answer.

Are there any other factors or circumstances outside the prison you feel to be relevant? Answer. Lack of family contact, bad relationship with his father in England, Liam's trouble with a restraining order with his girlfriend and the lack of contact with his family in Australia. 4. Was there a delay in identifying the discovery of Liam on evening of 19th March 2015 as requiring a code blue (emergency medical) response? Answer. Yes. If so, did that delay possibly contribute to the outcome? Answer. Yes. Was there a delay by prison staff in assisting paramedics to reach Liam's cell on that night? Answer. Yes.

His anticipated release date was 1St April 2015. On 12~h March he caused minor deliberate self harm and an ACCT document was opened, noting that the reason for his self-harm was due to bullying on the wing. He was identified as being socially isolated as his family were living in Australia. He had no visits and made no telephone calls: an official visitor was planned but did not see him before he died. Liam was assaulted on 2 separate occasions by different individuals, despite being moved from the wing where the bullying had taken place, as these individuals were encountered in general areas of the prison estate. Proper consideration of the risks, the available intelligence and Liam's activities would have avoided these assaults. The ACCT was not fully or properly completed or utilised and was closed inappropriately. On the day Liam ligatured himself, the ACCT was closed, he later that afternoon asked for and was granted a move to a single cell. He was discovered hanging later in the evening. The emergency response of the prison officers was not according to policy, and there was a delay in assisting the ambulance crew to attend scene. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The ACCT document was not completed fully, did not accompany Liam around the prison as it should have and not all appropriate individuals were invited to the reviews. Available documentary information was not read or used, and pressures of time were cited to explain these failings. Consideration should be given to formally confirming that all necessary documentation has been considered prior to the ACCT review, and to ensure the Officers and Healthcare staff are aware of their responsibilities. 2. This ACCT was only open for a short period. It did not serve Liam's needs properly and was closed before any review system picked up the inadequacies. 3. The Governor provided evidence that resourcing was affecting the ability of officers to carry out their duties regarding keeping prisoners safe from self harm. In this particularly vulnerable population of young men, their safety is paramount and this should be the first consideration."

3160,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/thomas-gallagher/,N/A: Not found,2016-08-11,L Hashmi,Greater Manchester (North),"Chief Constable for Greater Manchester Police, Force Headquarters",On the 25th July 2016. I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Martin Gallagher.,"Tom was aged 16 years at the time of his death. He had been diagnosed as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and psychosis by a child psychiatrist. In the months before his death he received care and treatment as a voluntary inpatient at a specialist adolescent mental health unit, whilst within the community he received care and support from the child and adolescent mental health team (CAMHS).
He had a history of self-harm/attempted suicide, including an attempt at self-ligature.
On the 10th July 2015 Tom had been working during the day and appeared relatively settled although he struggled to control the effects of his OCD. In the late afternoon/early evening, he became agitated and therefore decided to walk the dog in order to relieve the tension. He dropped the dog back home at around 19:30 but went straight out again. When he did not return home, his family tried to contact him on his mobile – by calls and text messaging. Tom failed to respond. This was unusual.
By 21:00 his family was becoming increasingly concerned and therefore carried out a search of the local area. At 02:44 on the 11th July 2015, Tom’s father contacted Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to report that his son was missing. The call taker created a Force Wide Incident Note (FWIN - 0405), completed the ‘1-12’ and coded the call as requiring a Grade 2 response which meant that the call required priority attendance, allocating by the radio operator within 20 minutes and attendance by a police officer within 1 hour from the creation of the Incident Log.
Tom was correctly identified as a missing person.
From this point on, the FWIN was delayed on no less than 14 occasions; the family’s call therefore remained unallocated. Almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without rationale. No service call was made to Tom’s family and as no officer was allocated, the ‘Golden Hour’ (important in terms of information gathering) was missed. The Incident Response Protocol - in particular the Grade 2 FWIN Escalation Process - was not followed, the cross-border process was not instigated and neither ‘Silver Command’ nor the OCB supervisor were made aware of the problems that were being encountered in allocating resources to FWIN 0405.
On the night in question, GMP was experiencing what was described as an ‘unprecedented/unpredictable spike’ in Grade 1-3 calls. There was also an ongoing policing operation within the town centre and staffing levels were low. The deployable resources available to the duty Inspector were approximately 50 % lower than those ‘on paper’. Staffing levels had been persistently lower than expected in the weeks before Tom’s death.
The low staffing levels of the 10-11 July 2015 were recognised in good time and were brought to the attention of the DRMU and the senior leadership team (SLT) on Monday 6th July at a routine meeting. However whilst it was agreed that additional resources would be allocated to support the Friday/Saturday shift a Chief Inspector subsequently declined to allocate/authorise this as he felt that the levels were ‘within tolerance’. This change of decision was not conveyed to the duty sergeant (who had been present at the Monday meeting) and/or divisional duty Inspector.
At around 08:00 Tom’s father made a further call to GMP as he had not heard anything. In the meantime, [REDACTED] resumed the search for her son.
At 08:07, Tom was discovered by a member of the public suspended by ligature from a tree in the park close to his home. A 999 call was made and police attended immediately. The fact of Tom’s death was confirmed by Paramedics at shortly before 08:30. Tom’s mother heard of her son’s death from a member of the public whilst trying to elicit information from an officer at the scene.
Following post mortem examination the medical cause of death was given as:
1a) Asphyxia
1b) Fatal pressure on the neck
1c) Hanging
At inquest GMP admitted shortcomings in the way that it responded to the family’s call for help.
The jury concluded suicide and added the following [sic]:
- Tom’s mental health issues
- Alteration in frequency of appointments with medical services due to transitional care
- The FWIN not being switched to supervisor after 20 minutes
- Lack of contact within the initial hour to the family
- Lack of justification for the delays on the FWIN
- It could not be concluded that the admitted shortcomings caused or contributed to the deceased’s death.
The Jury also found that Tom died ‘before 02:44 [on the] 11th July 2015’.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
1. The lack of formal training in relation to risk assessment and child mental health.

2. Save for the initial call handler, that all staff demonstrated intentional disregard of Force policies and protocols - including those with operational/management responsibilities and the Operational Communications Branch (OCB - see above).

3. That the Force has no set minimum staffing levels, including within divisional response and the OCB.

4. That when the persistently low staffing levels were brought to the attention of GMPs’ SLT, on more than one occasion, insufficient action was taken so as to ensure that the number of officers on duty matched those identified as being required ‘on paper’.

5. That when decisions were taken not to allocate additional cover/resources:
i) no rationale was recorded,
ii) no minutes were kept in relation to the decisions taken during the Monday meeting

iii) no contemporaneous record was made by the Chief Inspector regarding his decision to reverse the earlier agreement to allocate additional resources
&,
iv) the Chief inspector did not communicated his decision to those who needed to know.
6. Despite hearing evidence on the positive steps taken by GMP since Tom’s death, there was no solid evidence of resource commitment to prevent recurrence.
7. That there were 14 delays placed on FWIN 0405.
8. That almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without written rationale.
9. That FWIN 0405 went unallocated (despite some evidence of attempts to resource), resulting in the very important ‘Golden Hour’ being missed.
It was clear from the initial ‘1-12’ and the additional information recorded by the call taker within FWIN 0405 that Tom was not only vulnerable by virtue of his age but also due to the fact that he had complex mental health issues, the significance of which was arguably underestimated as a result of point 1 above.
It was accepted during the course of the evidence that the ‘1-12’ had been an initial assessment of risk only.
10. That no service call was made to Tom’s family to reassure them that they had not been forgotten."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 15th June 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was a short form suicide with narrative conclusion. The medical cause of death was 1A - Vasovagal Inhibition as a result of 1B - Hanging.","This 17 year old young lady ""Anielka"" was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in March 2010, aged 12 years and she suffered a stroke. She underwent a heart transplant in April 2010. Post procedure she recovered well from a cardiac perspective. However, she developed complicated neuro-psychological problems arising from the brain injury caused by the stroke. Anielka's home life was difficult, and she was often reluctant to engage with professionals. She engaged in risk taking behaviours, which included on occasion self-harming, alcohol, illicit drug use, and becoming involved in inappropriate relationships. In December 2014, Anielka was taken off a child protection plan which had been in place since 2011. Her care was being transitioned from child and young person's services to adult services. Multiple agencies were involved with Anielka's care, and her complex needs were identified. However, no lead professional was identified to coordinate her care. On more than one occasion the agencies did not communicate with each other. This led to missed opportunities to provide a structured care plan for Anielka. In January 2015, Anielka drew on her bedroom walls a number of images which indicated suicidal intent. Local mental health services were not made aware of this. On the 4th February 2015, she attended her final appointment at the children's transplant clinic. She travelled to Great Ormond Street with her father. Her journey was delayed by a fatality occurring on the railway line. She was also very upset after reading a report that referred to her ongoing need for support and services. The following day on the 5th February 2015, she left her father in Gloucester City centre at approximately 1000hrs. She made her way to her training college. She then departed for home. Her father returned home at about 1500 hours and found Anielka hanging by the neck from the bannister. A dressing gown cord had been used as the ligature. Her father cut her down and dialled emergency services. Paramedics arrived shortly thereafter and pronounced Anielka deceased at 1510 hours. Police are satisfied there are no suspicious circumstances. A suicide note was found at scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The conclusion of the inquest was ""Suicide"" and the cause of death of death was 1a. Hanging.","The deceased had a lengthy history of mental health issues attempting her first suicide, the evidence showed, at the age of 16. She had attempted suicide on a number of occasions in the past. She suffered a significant relapse in her mental health around August 2015 and had intensive input from the Mental Health Team - being dealt with and or contacted on an almost daily basis. On the 31st October 2015 she was detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act after it became clear that the input that she was having was not working and there were real concerns for her mental health and her risk of self harm/suicide. As no acute beds were available for her within the Powys area or indeed any surrounding area she was taken in the early hours of the morning to Bristol Priory Hospital where she remained until the Section was lifted on the 16th November. In the intervening period she had become physically unwell and was moved to another hospital for main stream medical care. Upon discharge home she remained under the care of the local community Mental Health Team (Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team) until her death on the 3rd January 2016. On that day concern was raised by her daughter who was unable to contact her and when police forced entry at her home address she was discovered hanging from a ligature on a bedroom door at her address.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) There is no acute facility in Powys for the treatment of acutely unwell patients, which, the evidence showed, often leads to patients being moved the length and breadth of the country to an establishment where a bed can be found. The evidence also showed that the local acute unit at the Redwood Centre in Shrewsbury had recently experienced a significant reduction in the number of acute beds available compounding and exacerbating the problem.
(2) As a consequence of 1 above there is often a lack of continuity of treatment which can be to the detriment of the patient concerned.
(3) The evidence showed that, on balance, it is likely that the experience of being sectioned in these circumstances had an adverse effect upon Mrs Taylor which fuelled an unwillingness, on her part, to engage with Mental Health professionals thereby increasing her risk of self harm/suicide.
(4) It is believed that Powys Health Board is the only Health Board in the country that has no facility available to it for the treatment of acute admission patients in the position of Mrs Taylor."

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 6th February 2015.

The Conclusion recorded was a narrative conclusion indicating that, on the 3rd December 2013 at [REDACTED] the deceased died as a result of tying a ligature around her neck. There is not sufficient evidence to indicate that she was intending to end her life. The deceased had moved to the Manchester area on the 26th October 2013 since when she had interactions with a number of agencies. There had been missed opportunities for agencies to obtain and collate information, to carry out adequate assessments of the information they held and to consider appropriate levels of support. Despite these failings there is not the evidence to say on the balance of probabilities that any of these matters caused or contributed to her death.","I do not propose to detail the significant evidence that was heard in this case save to say that the brief circumstances were as follows:

The deceased had always resided with her family in the Lancashire area. There had been increasing concern about her behaviour including her drug use, her abusive and aggressive outbursts, self-harming and her mental health. She had spent a month in July 2013 in the Platform facility in Preston, Lancashire. This is a mental health facility for young people.

Upon her discharge matters deteriorated and on the 25th October Kesia was arrested by Lancashire Police. Her behaviour whilst in custody was concerning but she was not deemed to require sectioning under the Mental Health Act.

Following her release from custody on the 26th October she threatened to jump from a bridge. The same day she went to live with her Father in the Tameside area of Manchester. Kesia had had little contact with her Father and he was not aware of all the recent issues and concerns surrounding Kesia.

From this point onwards Kesia had little contact with her mother and step-father who understandably had been severely impacted by the difficulties they had faced with Kesia.

Due to concerns about her behaviour whilst she was in police custody in Lancashire, Lancashire Constabulary raised a safeguarding report to the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) which led to a referral to Lancashire Children's Services. This referral indicated that Kesia was a high risk and likely to self-harm.

Given that Kesia was now residing in the Tameside Area the referral was then forwarded by Lancashire Children's Services to Tameside Children's Services.

Upon receiving the referral only part of the information provided by Lancashire was then cut and pasted onto Tameside's own Referral Form which was inputted onto the computer system. There was therefore incomplete information on their own form although the Lancashire form was also scanned onto the Tameside Computer system.

When the case was reviewed not all of the information was considered as only the incomplete Tameside form was ever read. A decision was taken not to open a file and conduct a social work assessment for Kesia but to send a referral to the Child Adolescent and Mental Health Service (CAMHS).

Upon receipt of this referral Pennine NHS Foundation Trust assessed the information provided by Tameside and sent the referral to the administrator of the service for an appointment to be sent to Kesia. No appointment had been sent to Kesia at the time of her death.

As a result of her arrest in Lancashire, Kesia was before the Magistrates Court in Preston on the 5th November 2013. She received a referral order. Lancashire Youth Offending Team attended court and noted Kesia's new address in Tameside.

However the case, which was then considered by at least 4 people in the Lancashire Youth Offending Team, was not transferred over to the Tameside Youth Offending Team at all prior to Kesia's death. On four occasions there was a failure to notice the new address for Kesia which was clearly marked on the documentation on the file.

This meant that the referral order assessment and panel process was not commenced and concluded within the national guidelines prior to her death. There was also inappropriate thought given to breaching Kesia for non-compliance of her referral order.

From the 26th October 2013 (whilst in the Manchester area) Kesia, on at least 8 occasions prior to her arrest on the 30th November, had some interaction with officers from Greater Manchester Police.

On one occasion she was reported as missing from home by her Father; she was located the following day residing with her boyfriend at the Armadale Road address.

On two occasions Kesia made calls to the police with allegations of domestic violence against her by her boyfriend.

On another occasion she made a report of an assault against her by the ex-partner of her boyfriend.

On the 25th November Kesia attended at her Mother's home in Lancashire where she was aggressive, threatened to push her grandmother down the stairs and had hold of a knife whilst threatening to self-harm.

Officers from Lancashire Constabulary attended, Kesia was calm at the time of their arrival and she was taken back to her Father's house by her Grandmother. Her Father was not provided with information as to the exact nature of what had occurred.

Lancashire Constabulary made a further referral to their MASH which assessed Kesia as a Medium Risk.

Following her move to the Manchester area the Inquest heard evidence which indicated that from shortly after the 26th October Kesia was not in fact residing at her Father's. She was in reality spending a lot of time residing with her boyfriend and also staying in other accommodation.

On the 30th November Kesia was arrested in Manchester by Greater Manchester Police for criminal damage and possession of cannabis. Shortly after her arrest and before her arrival at the police station, Kesia's presentation changed and she was extremely abusive and aggressive.

She remained in police custody, for reasons set out below, until the Monday morning when she was placed before the Court.

Her behaviour whilst in custody was of concern to custody staff and on two occasions police requested the attendance of medical professionals from MEDACS.

Whilst in custody, at the time of the first medical assessment, Kesia made a threat to jump off a bridge if she was released from custody. This was documented on the Risk Assessment Form on the custody record. A full risk assessment was not completed on her arrival into custody nor at any stage during her time in the police station.

Following her initial assessment by MEDACS there was a reasonable assessment made that Kesia was intoxicated and a decision taken to allow her time to sleep and potentially sober up. The Inquest heard evidence that the first nurse was not able to complete her assessment of Kesia at this stage.

A second assessment by MEDACS was conducted sometime later. The Inquest heard evidence about this assessment and also viewed the CCTV footage. The Inquest found that this assessment was incomplete and fell well short of being a meaningful assessment.

In addition the Inquest heard evidence as to whether MEDACS should be able to access records held about an individual if they had been assessed by their staff in a different police force area. When assessed in Manchester by MEDACS access to her Lancashire MEDACS records would not have been possible as her name had been entered as unknown and not updated.

During her interview and subsequent time in custody Kesia's behaviour remained concerning. A decision was taken not to bail Kesia but to keep her in custody in part due to the concerns officers had about her safety. The Inquest heard evidence as to the legislation surrounding 17 year olds in custody and additionally the availability of PACE beds for children in custody.

Whilst in custody Kesia had access to an appropriate adult. The request for an appropriate adult was made by Greater Manchester police to Tameside Social Services. A form was then sent to the volunteer who attended the police station. In Manchester the volunteer Appropriate Adult Scheme is run by the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC). The form completed by the appropriate adult should then be faxed back to Social Services. This did not happen.

Information about the threat Kesia had made to jump off a bridge was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) by way of the MG7 but it was not noted on the Prisoner Escort Record.

At Court Kesia was seen by her solicitor, Tameside Youth Offending Team and GEO Amey staff before her appearance in Court. At no stage did they become aware of the threat Kesia had made whilst in police custody as this was known only to the CPS.

No remand application was made therefore the CPS did not place the information as to her threat before the Court.

Whilst being held at the Magistrates Court Kesia's behaviour caused concern. Bail checks on appropriate addresses were not carried out. Kesia was released with a bail condition of residence at her Father's address.

She left court and went to her boyfriend's address where she stayed the night. She was found later the next morning in the garden of the property having tied a ligature around her neck.","Coroner Concerns

During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-

GOVERNMENT

Legislation and the provision of Local Authority Accommodation

1. The Inquest heard evidence that recent changes to legislation means that whilst in custody 17 year olds are now treated as children for the purposes of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE). However the failure to make legislative changes to the supporting legislation means that for 17 year olds there is an anomaly in the system particularly around the provision of accommodation for a 17 year old who is refused bail. For these purposes a 17 year old is still classed as an adult and not a child and therefore there is no requirement for local authorities to provide accommodation. This would require primary legislation.

There remains no legal requirement for local authorities to provide accommodation for 17 year olds who will then have to remain in police custody if bail is refused. The result is that 17 year old children risk being kept in custody for longer than necessary if there is nowhere suitable for them to be bailed to.

2. In addition the Inquest also heard evidence as to the reality of the situation in practice and the availability of such accommodation for those children to whom the law currently does apply i.e. 16 years and younger. The Inquest heard that across Greater Manchester it is estimated that, until recently, in only 10% of cases where the police requested such a service from a local authority a bed was available. Attempts are being made to address this issue but at present the figure remains at approximately 20% and the Inquest heard evidence that this was, ""not good enough"".

Again the facts heard at this Inquest seem to suggest that children younger than 17 are at risk of being held in custody longer than necessary due to a lack of appropriate facilities. The court heard evidence that the police are in the undesirable position of having to decide whether to detain someone (potentially unlawfully) or release them when they feel it may be unsafe to do so.

3. It was clear throughout the Inquest that the legislation relating to 17 year olds presented challenges to those professionals who had contact with Kesia. For the purposes of safeguarding and the Children's Act she remained a child, being someone under the age of 18. Equally, however, she was old enough to consent to be in a sexual relationship. The Court was left with little doubt that the differing legislative provisions for 17 year olds pose unique challenges for professionals in dealing with people of this age.

ACPO NATIONAL POLICE ISSUE

Exit Risk Assessments

1. The Court heard that since Kesia's death Greater Manchester Police have implemented a system to try and ensure that this situation does not happen again. It was therefore decided to hold a joint medical and police exit risk assessment when someone who has displayed self-harm ideation or behaviour leaves custody.

Initially this was introduced for people aged 17 and under but as of January 2015 it was extended to all people leaving custody.

Whilst this has been a significant commitment from Greater Manchester Police and has required the funding for an additional Doctor the Court heard evidence that so far this risk assessment has been conducted on over 144 people leaving custody.

This is clearly capturing a large number of people who are displaying signs of similar behaviour or thoughts as Kesia did whilst in custody and the Court heard that a joint medical and police risk assessment on their exit from custody is essential in trying to ensure appropriate support when they leave the police station.

LANCASHIRE YOUTH OFFENDING TEAM AND TAMESIDE YOUTH OFFENDING TEAM

1. The Court heard evidence as to the poor understanding and communication between the Youth Offending teams of Lancashire and Tameside following Kesia's re-location to the Manchester Area. There was a failure by Lancashire to note her move which led to a delay in her case being transferred, but in addition there was a failure in the communications with Tameside for each team to understand what was being requested and to have oversight of the situation. This led to a lack of involvement with Kesia and a proposal to breach her. It also meant that no effective work was being carried out with her and a missed opportunity to recognise her developing situation in terms of her lack of residence and drug use.

GREATER MANCHETSER POLICE

Safeguarding Responsibilities

1. The Inquest heard a great deal of evidence from officers as to their understanding and actions. No intelligence was placed on Kesia's nominal profile despite a number of concerning contacts with her by officers. It is a core function of the police to submit such intelligence.

2. Greater Manchester Police has no stand-alone safeguarding policy for matters which are not criminal. There is no clear guidance to officers regarding what to do to raise safeguarding issues. There is no process for the recording of safeguarding concerns. There is confusion and a lack of understanding as to which agencies officers should refer to and where this should be recorded. The fact that there was no record of Greater Manchester Police's involvement with Kesia, despite her having been reported missing from home, information about drugs, self-harm and being in a relationship with a much older individual did not flag-up one safeguarding referral to another agency was concerning.

Force Wide Incident Notices (FWINS)

1. There were a number of reported incidents relating to Kesia and her involvement with Greater Manchester police which necessitated the opening of a FWIN. The Court heard evidence as to the failure to pass on complete information to the officers who then subsequently attended on Kesia including on one occasion the fact that it had been communicated that she had a knife. The court heard evidence that the failure to pass on important information could impact on the safety of the officers and others and also lead to missed opportunities for safeguarding.

Closing Codes for Domestic Violence Incidents

1. Evidence was heard that when a FWIN is closed a code is attached to it. For domestic violence incidents the closing code relates to people over the age of 16 as being adults. This means that the case is not then automatically passed through to the Child Protection Team within Greater Manchester Police for a review even if one of the people involved is still a child - i.e. is 17 years of age.

Whilst the case would still be considered by the Public Protection Investigation Unit however the availability for the child protection unit to have all the information relating to children may be beneficial.

Checks carried out by Public Protection Investigation Unit

1. Evidence was given to the Court that when a Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Harassment form (DASH) is submitted to the PPI unit, where the risk level is standard then no checks on the Police National Computer or the Police National Database are carried out. The rationale for this was not clear although DC Evans indicated this may be due to the volume of work. Clearly the PNC can hold vital information about a potential offender.

CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE

1. Whilst recognising that the CPS do not have the same safeguarding responsibilities they had clear evidence as to the threat that Kesia had made and this was not put before the Court nor passed on to any other agencies. Nor was any additional information sought from GMP. There was a lack of understanding between GMP and the CPS as to how such important information should be shared between agencies.

PENNINE CARE NHS FOUNDATIONS TRUST / TAMESIDE YOUTH OFFENDING TEAM and MEDACS

1. The Court heard evidence about two matters involving Mental Health Services and other agencies. [REDACTED] gave evidence that in his view there would be interaction between their service and Tameside Youth Offending Team with regards to Kesia. This would either be done once the case had been passed to Amy Valentine or if Tameside YOT contacted their service. This did not occur as the file had not been processed at the time of Kesia's death but also because of the confusion between the Youth Offending Teams involved with Kesia which meant she was never picked up by Tameside. The plan that Kesia should be monitored for any interim changes in her risk did not therefore occur.

GREATER MANCHESTER LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND GREATER MANCHESTER POLICE

Multi- Agency Safeguarding Hubs

1. The Court heard evidence as to the effective working in Lancashire County Council and Lancashire Constabulary of the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH). It was clear from the evidence that the plan is that by the end of the year across Manchester there will be fully operational safeguarding hubs but that each different local authority wants to go about it in a different way. This will mean that there is a lack of consistency in approach across the different local authorities in Manchester as to what will be dealt with. Worryingly some will not deal with safeguarding of children and such an approach may lead to a lack of consensus and understanding of their roles. In addition such an individual approach will need careful understanding by other agencies as to what can be referred and what cannot - potentially exacerbating an already difficult and confusing situation.

ALL AGENCIES

1. Having heard the evidence the Court felt that there was a degree of confusion and misunderstanding between all the agencies as to their roles, what they are able and not able to do and also where to access important and effective information. By way of brief examples, when Kesia was in custody MEDACS contacted the Crisis Team to see if Kesia was known to them, Kesia had never been involved with the Crisis Team. There was no contact made with the Mental Health Services who did have information that she was waiting for an appointment or with the Youth Offending Team who had a referral order in place.

Custody Handovers

1. The Court heard evidence that the handovers which ensure that custody officers taking charge for detainees and their welfare have to conduct such handovers in their own time. The system at present relies on officers and staff attending work early and sometimes staying late after a 12 hour shift to provide a handover. Whilst it is clear there would need to be some overlap in the times people are on duty, the Court heard evidence as to the quality of the handovers which is clearly impacted by the fact that this crucial part of the information sharing process relies entirely on the free-time of officers and staff.

The Court was advised that the provision of custody within GMP is currently under review but at present the position remains as it was in 2013.

Completion of the Prisoner Escort Record

1. The Prisoner Escort Record form was completed over 12 hours prior to Kesia leaving police custody. It was not checked or amended prior to her release and it failed to contain crucial information indicating that whilst in custody Kesia had made a threat to jump from a bridge. This should have been included.

GREATER MANCHESTER POLICE AND PENNINE CARE NHS FOUNDATION TRUST

Tameside Diversion Project

1. The Court heard evidence regarding a project in Tameside similar to one in Newcastle the aim of which was apparently to divert young people from the Criminal Justice System. However the Court heard that the Tameside Youth Diversion Project is not working as intended. The plan being that once someone is arrested there should be consideration to diverting the young person away from the Criminal Justice System if there is evidence of emotional disturbance / self-harm, etc. The court heard evidence that in Tameside this signposting is only taking place to the mental health services once the young person has been processed through the Criminal Justice System and is not in fact acting as a diversion pathway. There was no evidence from those working in custody that any consideration was given to this scheme for Kesia and there appeared to be little knowledge of the scheme. On the face of the evidence the current system appeared to duplicate the work carried out by the 16-19 Mental Health Service.

GREATER MANCHESTER POLICE / POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES

Appropriate Adult Scheme:

These concerns relate solely to the Appropriate Adult Scheme.

During the course of the Inquest the Court received a copy of the Protocol in place between the Police and Crime Commissioners Office, the Local Authorities and the Police. Evidence was heard from the Social Worker who received the call from GMP requesting an Appropriate Adult for Kesia and the Appropriate Adult who attended.

1. The evidence of the Social Worker was that until the commencement of the Inquest she was not aware and had not had sight of the Protocol document. It was her understanding that in all cases except for murder/rape and terrorism offences that an Appropriate Adult from the volunteer scheme would attend. It was not her understanding of the system in place that she should be assessing the information given to her by the police to consider whether it was more suitable for the attendance of a Social Worker. She indicated that if she had been aware of this she would have made further enquiries as to how Kesia was presenting in custody in order to make that assessment.

She also indicated that when she was contacted by Greater Manchester Police no concerns at all were raised as to how Kesia had been in custody ( at this stage she had been in custody for over 12 hours). She was not advised that Kesia had been assessed as intoxicated on arrival, nor that she had been seen by MEDACS, nor that she had threatened to jump off a bridge on her release. She indicated that if she had been aware of these matters she would have asked her colleague social worker who was also on call and who was an approved Mental Health Social Worker to attend as the Appropriate Adult.

The Court heard evidence that following her attendance the appropriate adult completed the relevant form which would normally be faxed back to Social Services by Greater Manchester Police Officers. It was her understanding that this was the responsibility of Greater Manchester Police and that she also thought that on receiving the form Social Services may want to, "" do something further possibly have proper metal health assessment on Kesia"".

Evidence from Tameside Social Services indicated that they did not receive the completed form in relation to Kesia and that it was not unusual not to receive the completed forms in any cases.

Whilst the Court was informed that the PCC have facilitated the availability of equipment to Greater Manchester Police so that the form can be scanned back to Social Services, there was nothing in the protocol document which placed the responsibility for the return of this form on the Custody Staff. Nor was any evidence presented that this was being done.

MEDACS

1. The Court heard and saw CCTV evidence of the second medical assessment which was conducted on Kesia. It was the Court's view that this fell far short of what was expected in order to reach any conclusions as to the fitness and wellbeing of Kesia. It was clear that a medical assessment could not be completed and in these circumstances this should be fully explained to the police and the record endorsed accordingly rather than simply endorsing that someone is fit to be detained/interviewed or transferred."
3799,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/aleysha-mcloughlin/,2015-0136,2015-04-08,Jennifer Leeming,Manchester (West),"1. The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt, Minister for Health
2. The Rt Hon Nicky Morgan, Minister for Education
3. The Rt Hon Eric Pickles, Minister for Local Government","On 4th April 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin, Aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20th March 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had committed Suicide. The medical cause of her death was 1a Hanging.","On the 15th of July 2003 a Care Order relating to Aleysha McLoughlin was made at Manchester County Court upon the application of Bolton Council.

Aleysha was then placed with a family member, where she remained settled until the 9th of September 2012 when she went to stay with her mother and refused to return. On the 8th of October Aleysha left her mother's address and although there was a short period thereafter when Aleysha returned to live with her family member the placement broke down. Accordingly on the 26th of November 2012 Aleysha was placed with a foster carer where she remained until her death in April 2014. As the foster carer lived in a different area Aleysha also changed schools, and at first she appeared to make a positive start at her new school. However from in or about March 2013 her schoolwork and behaviour began to deteriorate.

Likewise Aleysha appeared to settle well with her foster carer. However on the 13th of March 2013 she left her foster carer's home and did not return until the 20th of March 2013. When asked where she had been Aleysha said that she had been with her mother.

In early June 2013 the head of Aleysha's year at school had a preventative meeting with her and her foster carer to address a perceived deterioration in Aleysha's behaviour. Aleysha did not engage at that meeting, and her behaviour was perceived to continue to be poor.

On or about the 8th of June 2013 Aleysha again left her foster carer's home and did not return until the 20th of June, on this occasion saying that she had been with her sister.

On the 25th of June 2013 whilst Aleysha's sister was visiting her at her foster carer's home Aleysha reported to her carer that her sister had taken an overdose. The following evening, the 27th of June, Aleysha herself took an overdose of aspirin and paracetamol. She was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where she initially refused treatment, and even after consenting she later removed the cannula administering intravenous medication and had to be persuaded to have it restored. During Aleysha's hospital admission clinicians from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) assessed her and a further appointment was made for her to see a CAMHS clinical psychologist after her discharge from hospital. On the 5th of July 2013 Aleysha attended that appointment with her foster carer. Aleysha did not want any further involvement with CAMHS and as Aleysha's risk of further self harm was, for various reasons, believed to be reduced, it was decided that there was no ongoing role for CAMHS at that time, although an offer of re-referral was made should matters change.

When Aleysha returned to school after the summer holiday in September 2013 she was perceived as continuing to be uncooperative and difficult to engage.

On a date between in or about October 2013 and at or about Christmas of 2013 one of the Social Workers involved with Aleysha was informed by Aleysha's foster carer that Aleysha had inflicted some superficial cuts upon herself. The social worker believed that this was a historical event and did not ask Aleysha about it.

On the 7th of January 2014 Aleysha and her sister both took overdoses of aspirin and they were taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital. Clinicians wanted to admit Aleysha to the hospital for observation because she was believed to have taken a potentially life threatening overdose, but Aleysha refused to be admitted. She was seen by a Doctor in the Accident and Emergency Department of the Hospital, who decided that she had the capacity to refuse treatment and noted that she was discharged. Aleysha was subsequently seen by a Doctor specializing in mental health, who had concerns that Aleysha did not, in fact, have the capacity to refuse treatment. However medical staff would not then admit Aleysha to the hospital because a medical doctor had discharged her. Whilst discussions about this were continuing Aleysha left the hospital with her sister, who was also refusing treatment. Aleysha and her sister were returned to the hospital the following morning, and a mental health nurse who was a member of the Rapid Assessment Interface Discharge (RAID) team then assessed Aleysha. Aleysha continued to refuse to be admitted to hospital and was then assessed to have the capacity to make that decision. In the course of the assessment Aleysha told the mental health nurse that she had self- harmed by cutting herself, although she had not done that recently. That information was not passed to other agencies. Particularly it was not contained in the information subsequently passed to CAMHS nor was it given to Social Services nor Aleysha's school. During the assessment Aleysha stated that she did not then want to end her life but that she had wanted to do so at the time when she had taken the overdose. At the conclusion of the assessment it was determined that whilst Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self harm she was at ongoing risk of impulsive self harm, and arrangements were made for her to have an appointment with CAMHS, despite Aleysha stating that she would not attend. Aleysha was also referred to the Safeguarding Children Team at the Royal Bolton Hospital.

On the 8th of January 2014 Aleysha was seen by her school nurse, who had been informed of her hospital attendance by the Safeguarding team. Aleysha declined further support from the nurse, who did not then contact Aleysha again.

On the 8th of February 2014 Aleysha and her sister were seen to be on the wrong side of the fencing of a road bridge where they were at risk of jumping or falling onto the carriageway below. Police Officers attended, and Aleysha walked off the bridge. She was then detained by the Police under the terms of the Mental Health Act and taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital, where she was seen by two Doctors specializing in psychiatry and an Approved Mental Health Professional who was a social worker, for the purpose of a Mental Health Act assessment. Aleysha did not fully engage during the assessment, and denied that she had intended to harm herself when she had been on the bridge. The assessment concluded that Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self-harm, but that she remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm. Aleysha was then discharged from detention under the Mental Health Act. A further referral was made to the Safeguarding team and to CAMHS, although Aleysha again said that she would not attend at CAMHS, stating that she didn't need it. On the 11th of February 2014 a secretary working for the CAMHS team telephoned Aleysha and offered her an appointment with a mental health practitioner on the 17th of February, which Aleysha refused. On the 18th of February a social worker contacted a mental health nurse at CAMHS in order to share information regarding Aleysha particularly with regard to the events of the 8th of February described above. The ensuing discussion included an acknowledgement of the risks presented to Aleysha as a consequence of her impulsive behaviour when she was with her sister. Aleysha's refusal to engage with CAMHS was also discussed and the Social Worker planned that Aleysha's foster carer should be contacted and asked to encourage Aleysha to attend an appointment with CAMHS. On the 25th of February a multi agency meeting was held by social services to address Aleysha's self harming behaviour and her refusal to engage with CAMHS. CAMHS were not invited to this, nor to any other meeting. It was agreed that in view of Aleysha's refusal to engage with mental health services her foster carer should receive some training as to means of promoting Aleysha's engagement with those services. This training had not been put into place by the time of Aleysha's death on the 3rd of April 2014.

On the 6th of March 2014 Aleysha was excluded from school for five days due to her bad behaviour. A meeting took place with Aleysha and her foster carer and an individual programme of lessons was agreed, so as to support Aleysha during the period leading up to her forthcoming public examinations.

On the 2nd of April 2014 a pupil at Aleysha's school told Aleysha's head of year that Aleysha had self-harmed by cutting her arms. Aleysha's social worker and her foster carer were informed and when they saw Aleysha an ambulance was summonsed and Aleysha was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital with her foster carer following. When Aleysha was treated she was found to have twenty-nine recent lacerations on her left arm, together with scarring from older wounds. Neither Aleysha's foster carer nor Social Services had previously been aware that Aleysha was self-harming to this level. Whilst Aleysha's wound were being closed the treating nurse asked Aleysha if she wanted to see anyone from the RAID team, but Aleysha declined. Despite this the nurse contacted the RAID team and a mental health nurse assessed Aleysha. The assessment concluded that on this occasion Aleysha's self-harm was not an acute incident of attempted suicide but that Aleysha remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm. The means of treating this risk was ongoing psychological therapy such as was offered by CAMHS and the nurse conducting the assessment encouraged Aleysha to attend CAMHS despite her expressed reluctance to do so.

At about 3pm on the 3rd of April 2014 Aleysha was found deceased by her foster carer at their home address [REDACTED]. She had hanged herself. Prior to her death she had been researching websites relating to suicide and hanging. She had also taken amphetamine, which could have induced depression.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

Evidence was given at the Inquest that self harm in young people is becoming a public health crisis. Evidence revealed that 3 out of 10 young people have self harmed at some time during their lives. Accordingly the matters of concern revealed were as follows:-

(1) That it should be considered that the system of training for those working with young people, including teachers, school nurses, foster carers, social workers, mental health workers and medical nurses and doctors should be reviewed so as to ensure that these professionals should be alert for signs of self harm and should take opportunities to discover themselves so that those harming themselves can be offered help and support. By way of example evidence was given at the Inquest that the annual health check offered to looked after children did not include a blood pressure check. If a blood pressure check was included this would provide an opportunity for signs of self harm to be revealed.

(2) That it should be considered that additional information and encouragement could be offered to young people to inform those able to help for example teachers, nurses, health professionals etc. when a young person becomes aware that another young person is self harming. The shocking self harm to which Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had subjected herself was only revealed when a school friend brought it to the attention of a teacher. There was no evidence that there was any system in place to encourage the passing of such information.

(3) That it should be considered that systems such as those now being developed in Bolton should be further developed so as to ensure that multi agency discussions involving all relevant agencies are held urgently for those at risk of self harm and particularly for those who do not engage. Evidence was given that meetings concerning Aleysha Martine Karle McLoughlin did not include the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services although evidence was given that their input would have been valuable.

(4) That it should be considered that a particular pathway of help for young people who resist engagement should be developed. There was no evidence that any such formal pathway had been shared at the present time.

(5) That a review of the capacity of the agencies involved in helping young people who are self harming to address those matters appropriately should be considered."
