Schofield,West Sussex,The Chief Constable Sussex Police; Police and Crime Commissioner,On 24 May 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jade Hutchings aged 18. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 September 2022.,"In 2019 Jade's behaviour started to deteriorate. He dropped out of St Pauls' College and started to get involved in criminal activity. He came to the attention of Children Services, the Mental Health Service and the Police having been the victim of assaults, being involved in domestic disputes and having been arrested for aggravated burglary. Alcohol and substance misuse played a substantive part in his lifestyle. At 22:07 on 20th May 2020 Mrs Hutchings Jade's mother reported to the police that Jade who was 18 at the time had not returned home. She said that he had left the house at 17:00 under the influence of alcohol and drugs saying that he would be back soon. He didn't return so Mrs Hutchings contacted his friends but they had not heard from him. She was concerned for her son as this was out of character for him and he had previously been assaulted. The Police treated Jade as a missing person and tried to locate Jade. At 03:00 police located Jade at Hastings Town Centre. He was drunk. The Police did not detain him under Section 136 Mental Health Act as they did think it was necessary. They transported him back home to Haywards Heath. On arriving home he went to bed. When Jade woke up the following morning, he was argumentative with his mother. He eventually calmed down and apologised. Later that morning his mother and sister left the house to go to the shops. They arrived back home at about 14:00 and went upstairs where they found Jade hanging. Mrs Hutchings and some of her neighbours began CPR on Jade and an ambulance arrived along with several police officers who assisted with CPR. Jade was taken to Brighton Hospital where despite treatment he died on 23rd May 2020.",Inadequate police training on mental health during the course of the inquest officers involved in dealing with Jade and in particular around the exercise of their Section 136 powers on twenty first May two thousand and twenty acknowledged that they had received very little mental health training. Some officers could not recall any additional training provided since their initial training when they first joined the force. The officers admitted that although they were aware of the Sussex Police mental health guide they had not read it in full. The expert police witness told the inquest that in his view the online training provision that we were told was being rolled out in Sussex was not sufficient. None of the officers involved in this case had yet undertaken this online training. It was his opinion that officers should be provided with the nationally recognised two day training course written by the College of Policing. The course is available for all police forces to be rolled out locally. This training had not been adopted by Sussex Police. There was also confusion amongst officers and a lack of clear understanding around the provision and use of service the Haven at Millview could provide. Reboot lack of provision for older age group there was clear evidence that Jade was vulnerable and had become involved in violence and crime in two thousand and nineteen the year before his death. It was believed by some that Jade was exploited by gangs running county line drug operations. A need for an early intervention was identified by his social worker and a referral to Reboot was made. The inquest was told that at the time Reboot was prioritising twelve to fourteen years children and as Jade was nearing eighteen they were unable to work with him. This was a missed opportunity for Jade to be involved in a form of early intervention before his life started unravelling and he became more heavily entrenched in the world of crime. It is understood that at the time of Jade's death the Police and Crime Commissioner was responsible for the Reboot scheme but at the time of writing this report the scheme is now run by Sussex Police.,"""Jade Hutchings aged 18""; ""found Jade hanging""; ""he died on 23rd May 2020"""

Walker,Northern District of Greater London,"Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; Damian Collins MP; Baker & McKenzie LLP; Pinterest; RPC; Meta Platforms; Snap Inc; Twitter International Company c/o Trust & Safety – Legal Policy",On the 21 November 2017 I opened an investigation touching the death of Molly Rose Russell aged 14 years old. I opened an inquest on the 1 December 2017. The inquest concluded on the 30 September 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was “Molly Rose Russell died from an act of self-harm whilst suffering from depression and the negative effects of on-line content”. The medical cause of death was 1a Suspension.,"Molly Rose Russell was found having hanged herself on the twenty-first of November two thousand and seventeen. Molly was 14 years old. Molly appeared a normal healthy girl who was flourishing at school, having settled well into secondary school life and displayed an enthusiastic interest in the performing arts. However, Molly had become depressed, a common condition affecting children of this age. This then worsened into a depressive illness. Molly subscribed to a number of online sites. At the time that these sites were viewed by Molly some of these sites were not safe as they allowed access to adult content that should not have been available for a 14-year-old child to see. The way that the platforms operated meant that Molly had access to images, video clips and text concerning or concerned with self-harm, suicide or that were otherwise negative or depressing in nature. The platform operated in such a way using algorithms as to result, in some circumstances, of binge periods of images, video clips and text some of which were selected and provided without Molly requesting them. These binge periods, if involving this content are likely to have had a negative effect on Molly. Some of this content romanticised acts of self-harm by young people on themselves. Other content sought to isolate and discourage discussion with those who may have been able to help. Molly turned to celebrities for help not realising there was little prospect of a reply. In some cases, the content was particularly graphic, tending to portray self-harm and suicide as an inevitable consequence of a condition that could not be recovered from. The sites normalised her condition focusing on a limited and irrational view without any counterbalance of normality. It is likely that the above material viewed by Molly, already suffering with a depressive illness and vulnerable due to her age, affected her mental health in a negative way and contributed to her death in a more than minimal way.","There was no separation between adult and child parts of the platforms or separate platforms for children and adults. There was no age verification when signing up to the online platform. That the content was not controlled so as to be age specific. That algorithms were used to provide content together with adverts. That the parent, guardian or carer did not have access to the material being viewed or any control over that material. That the child's account was not capable of being separately linked to the parent, guardian or carer's account for monitoring.","""Molly Rose Russell aged 14 years old""; ""Molly Rose Russell died from an act of self-harm""; ""Molly Rose Russell was found having hanged herself"""
149,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/chelsea-mooney-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2022-0259,2022-08-18,A. Combes,South Yorkshire West District,Cygnet Health Care; NHS England,On 19 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney born on 11 September 2003. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which commenced on 7 March 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was On the 10 April 2021 in Cygnet Hospital Sheffield Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney performed an act of self-harm by tying two non-fixed ligatures As a result of insufficient care crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response this led to her unexpected death two days later on 12 April in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield There was also a jury questionnaire which was completed and is appended to this Regulation 28 report for information,It is clear from the evidence that was heard during the inquest that Chelsea initially developed a type of eating disorder that required support. She was admitted to a number of mental health inpatient units leading to her admission to Cygnet in Sheffield. Whilst in this facility a number of material things happened Chelsea began to self-harm using ligatures which was a new behaviour Chelsea's working diagnosis became PTSD Chelsea made a number of allegations of abuse by members of her family and others which required investigating Chelsea declined to share information with her family Chelsea's family were advised that young people are not given a fixed diagnosis and that the working diagnosis was PTSD. Chelsea's family were keen to explore a diagnosis of autism however despite there not being a fixed diagnosis for Chelsea this was not explored by the treating team and Chelsea's diagnosis of PTSD does not appear to have been routinely reviewed through her admission. To be clear I mean that her diagnosis was not reviewed not that her treatment and plans were not reviewed. There also seems to have been a move away from a diagnosis of an eating disorder and following the inquest I am not clear that I understand the rationale for this other than PTSD appeared to be a better fit for Chelsea's symptoms. Chelsea started to use ligatures in Cygnet having not done so previously. Again this does not appear to have been a cause of significant concern and appears to be the norm within Chelsea's peer cohort. There was one particular issue for Chelsea however which came to light during the inquest which was that male members of staff felt concerned about interacting with Chelsea alone even where that delayed support in risky situations. I heard evidence that there came a time when Chelsea did not wish for her parents to be aware of what was happening in Cygnet or have any information about her health and that she had capacity to make this decision. I have subsequently received the Capacity Assessment that supports this view. I also heard in evidence that the Capacity Assessment ought to have been revisited and that there were circumstances when a patient's wishes could not be respected. This was particularly relevant to Chelsea's mother having limited information and then supporting her on s17 leave. I also heard that Chelsea was supported by a legal advisor for the purposes of her detention under the Mental Health Act. I also heard no evidence that her age was considered and whether or not she was competent to make this decision even if she had capacity. Chelsea was 17 at the time of her death this required careful exploration with her and there was no evidence of this. I heard evidence that the check on Chelsea was delayed due to another emergency on the unit namely the tying of a ligature by another individual. I also heard evidence that the timing of Chelsea's checks were not in accordance with recognised policy and ought perhaps to have prompted a different review and approval process although the timings were appropriate and designed to keep Chelsea safe. I heard evidence and the jury expressly accepted that the alarm being pulled for the other patient using a ligature would be heard by Chelsea and was a relevant factor in her ligature event. I then heard that when she was checked the member of staff who checked on her would not lay hands on her as he was a male member of staff alone in the room and was worried about repercussions. He therefore sought support from a female member of staff who went to check on Chelsea and realised that she was not conscious. She then shouted for help and a ligature knife. There were then further delays as others came to observe Chelsea collected the ligature knife and removed the ligature then commenced CPR with the red bag. The jury found that these delays were unreasonable in the circumstances. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence about the co-ordination of CPR was that every member of staff present believed one individual was leading the CPR response however that particular individual was not aware of that. Whilst this did not materially change the CPR in this case it was certainly not indicative of a well-rehearsed and practised response to an emergency situation.,"1 The diagnosis whilst described as not being fixed was not adequately reviewed. The primary witness for Cygnet in relation to diagnosis lacked professional curiosity even when asked questions in evidence. For example dismissing the potential that Chelsea may be hyperbolic in some of her descriptions of incidents and could that be relevant to diagnosis or treatment; evidence from the family about another member of the family with an autism diagnosis was not followed up the evidence from Cygnet being that they had not been aware the family wished to explore this; nonetheless in evidence it was dismissed as a possibility. 2 Whilst it is important that the young person is believed and has confidence in those with a therapeutic relationship that she will be believed when she makes disclosures; there was almost no professional curiosity about the allegations and whether they spoke to something else going on with Chelsea. The allegations that were made were blindly accepted by the team and one example where this was problematic is that part of Chelsea's PTSD diagnosis was based on flashbacks. One of the flashbacks which she described related to finding her aunt dead. Her aunt was not dead and in fact attended the inquest proceedings however this had not been clarified with the family and the treating team accepted this information from Chelsea unequivocally. It is clear there is a very fine balance to tread as it is clear that Chelsea was suffering from flashbacks and had suffered trauma, there was no demonstrable exploration of this. 3 The decision not to share information with family was made based on one capacity assessment. This did not fully address the issues with Chelsea of understanding the consequences of that decision and neither does it adequately break down the information which Cygnet may wish to share with family. This appears to have been a blanket decision and once a capacity assessment determined that Chelsea had the capacity to make that decision there is not evidence available to me of conversations with Chelsea to establish exactly what she would and would not share with family and that the consequences of those decisions were adequately explored with her. I would have expected at Chelsea's age that a social worker would be involved in supporting her with this decision and reviewing it regularly. This decision about her capacity and information sharing were also not revisited which they ought to have been regularly. Not least because Chelsea's mother was responsible for supporting her with s17 leave and was entitled to fully understand the risks to Chelsea or herself through this. 4 There was no evidence of debrief after prior incidents of ligatures or other self-harm attempts and therefore crucial information about Chelsea's state of mind, motivation and methods was missing from future planning and risk assessments. 5 There was limited concern about the number of ligature incidents collectively across the ward. They appear to have been accepted as normal behaviour. There was no record of Chelsea using ligatures prior to her admission onto this ward. This reality for staff appears to have led to a downgrading of the seriousness of the use of ligatures. With staff describing in evidence when they would and would not intervene and what would and would not constitute a serious incident in relation to ligatures ie a hospital admission would be required before it was regarded as a serious incident requiring immediate changes to risk levels and observations. It may be that this approach to ligatures also contributed to the delay in Chelsea's final ligature being removed. 6 Male staff were nervous and uncertain of how to approach Chelsea when they were alone. Clear guidance needed to be made available to them on how to deal with this. Although in evidence staff said that if there was an emergency they would attend even if alone this was not the case in practice as the male member of staff sought female support before recognising that Chelsea was in crisis. 7 The approach of three members of staff checking Chelsea before the ligature knife was brought and used led to avoidable delay. I am aware from the evidence that there are practice exercises involving the Red Bag however I am not clear that the same is practised in relation to the check, identification of a ligature and obtaining and using the ligature knife in these situations. 8 Whilst in evidence I have heard about the practice exercises using the Red Bag it is clear that there was limited confidence and clarity around the CPR needed for Chelsea. There was not a clear structure of one person leading and others knowing exactly what and how to do tasks. 9 There were opportunities for commissioners to support Cygnet earlier when case managing Chelsea's package of care. The new behaviour of using ligatures should have invited professional curiosity from commissioners who should have sought assurance about the overall practice of ligature use and intervention from Cygnet but also what that meant specifically for Chelsea and how Cygnet were keeping her safe. This may have led to a review by Cygnet and a better understanding of Chelsea's ligature use. 10 Commissioners also ought to have spoken to Chelsea themselves and assured themselves about the decision not to share information with her family; particularly her mother who had been a huge support for Chelsea prior to Covid-19. The impact of the cessation of face-to-face visits on anyone detained under the mental health act but particularly young people like Chelsea appears to have been underestimated.","""Chelsea was 17 at the time of her death""; ""Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney performed an act of self-harm by tying two non-fixed ligatures""; ""this led to her unexpected death two days later on 12 April"""

Persaud,East London,"Royal College of Paediatrics & Child Health, NHS England; Medical Director, Health Education England; President, Royal College of Psychiatrists","On the thirteenth June two thousand and nineteen I commenced an investigation into the death of Lily May Girton. Lily was seventeen years old when she passed away on the first June two thousand and nineteen. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the ninth August two thousand and twenty-two. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion:

Lily Girton took her own life whilst suffering from a mental illness. Her death was contributed to by a failure of the community CAMHS team to expedite an assessment by a psychiatrist to carefully and robustly assess and manage her risk to self and by a failure to titrate up her anti-depressant medication to an effective dose.","Lily Girton suffered from anxiety, depression and emotional dysregulation. She sought assistance from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in December 2018. She was asked to register with a new GP before she could access the service. On 12 March 2019 she was seen for her first assessment with the team. Later the same day, Lily presented in distress at Euston station and required detention under section 136 of the MHA for her own safety. She was taken to University College Hospital where she was admitted to a paediatric ward and where she received care from the psychiatric liaison team. Following this brief admission, Lily was prescribed antidepressants by her GP who expected the community CAMHS team to continue monitoring and prescribing this medication. The community team did not do this and Lily was not seen by a psychiatrist within the community CAMHS team. Lily was seen by a social worker within the CAMHS team, who had been appointed as her care co-ordinator. The care co-ordinator provided cognitive behavioural therapy. She did not take steps to expedite the psychiatric appointment; did not take steps to ensure that Lily's medication was appropriately titrated and did not carefully assess, document and communicate Lily's risk to self. On 29 April 2019, Lily was admitted to University Hospital again, requiring a longer admission and presenting with higher risk. The concerns of the hospital team were communicated to the community CAMHS teams, but Lily's care plan was not materially altered. On 31 May 2019, Lily was involved in an altercation with a group of males in a kebab shop. She was mocked by the males and she reported that one of the males had hit her. In the early hours of 1 June 2019, Lily was discovered at her partner's home address. Her life was pronounced extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. The altercation in the kebab shop is likely to have contributed to a decline in Lily's mental state on 31 May 2019. The failings in the care provided to her by the community CAMHS team left Lily without the resilience to manage the decline in her mental state.","The inquest heard that CAMHS services nationally have a lack of adequate staffing levels in the form of doctors, in the form of psychiatrists, registered mental health nurses and psychotherapy staff. The inquest heard that consultants often have an average of 130 to 150 active cases on their caseloads. This is substantially higher than the recommended caseloads by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The lack of staffing and resources contributed to Lily's death and there is a concern that the ongoing shortages of suitably trained staff within CAMHS teams poses a risk of future deaths of young people.","""Lily was seventeen years old when she passed away""; ""Lily Girton took her own life"""

Schofield,West Sussex,"The Rt Hon Steve Barclay, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care",On 10 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Robyn Lily Audrey Skilton aged 14. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 June 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that Robyn took her own life whilst struggling with her mental health. The mental health services failed Robyn as they did not recognise the deterioration of her mental health nor provide her with the care and treatment she required. Her death was contributed to by neglect.,On 7 May 2021 Robyn Skilton was found in Southwater Park having tied a ligature around her neck. Emergency services were called but death was confirmed at 1251 hrs. Robyn had a history of mental health problems which included self harming. Despite her deteriorating mental health at the time of her death she was still awaiting a formal assessment by a Child Psychiatrist.,Robyn was failed by the Mental Health Services quite frankly due to the current lack of resourcing and provision in place to support young people struggling with their mental health. Due to the lack of availability of a Child Psychiatrist there are long waiting times for children to be assessed. Robyn was not seen by a Child Psychiatrist and or Psychologist despite there being a need for this to happen thereby enabling her to be diagnosed and receive a treatment plan. Robyn's parents did everything they could during this period to support Robyn including paying for a private counsellor but sadly Robyn's mental health continued to deteriorate during this time and she took her own life. Robyn initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services CAMHS similarly did not happen in a timely manner. I do appreciate that the landscape that the local mental health Trust Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust was working under and the fact that Covid heightened the level of complexity across many services but there were many failings in the care provided to Robyn. It became very clear during the Inquest that there is significant under funding of the local mental health Trust who like many mental health Trusts have seen an explosion of referrals to their Children and Mental Health services CAMHS. By way of an example referrals to West Sussex CAMHS have increased by 95.6 per cent from May 2019 to May 2022. West Sussex CAMHS caseload has increased by 85 per cent from May 2019 to May 2022. West Sussex CAMHS Duty caseload has increased by 112 per cent from May 2021 to May 2022. Mental Health A and E presentations in period April 2021 to March 2022 have increased by 40 per cent on previous year April 2020 to March 2021. Additionally across Sussex CAMHS as a whole the referrals data shows May 2022 was the highest number of referrals the service has ever received. Of those referrals 80 per cent were accepted into the service. In comparison in May 2019 65 per cent were accepted. So an additional 502 young people have been accepted in May 2022 compared to May 2019. Despite the increase in numbers accessing CAMHS there has not been any relative increase in resources to meet this demand and therefore the current position is unsustainable and it is putting many young people's lives at risk.,"""Robyn Lily Audrey Skilton aged 14""; ""Robyn took her own life""; ""Robyn took her own life whilst struggling with her mental health""; ""death was confirmed at 1251 hrs"""

The medical cause of death was recorded as polytrauma. The conclusion was a narrative conclusion - died as a result of catastrophic injuries sustained after he jumped from the [REDACTED] at the Rock centre in Bury. There was no evidence of his intention and he had a history of psychosis.,"Stanislav was 17 years old when he died on the third of February two thousand and twenty-two. Concerns had been raised about his mental health and he was admitted as an inpatient. He was diagnosed with acute onset psychosis. He was discharged from hospital in May two thousand and twenty and his care was passed to the Early Intervention team. Stanislav presented as a high risk to others. He travelled to Slovakia with his family in September two thousand and twenty and he returned in January two thousand and twenty-one. At this time there had been a clear deterioration in his mental health. There were repeated attempts to engage him and referrals for a mental health act assessment. On the twenty-second of January the court heard that a mental health act assessment was attempted at the home address. In attendance was a Section 12 approved independent psychiatrist, a Consultant Psychiatrist from the treating trust, the Approved Mental Health Practitioner and a professional who was involved in sourcing a bed for Stanislav. All members of this group gave evidence to the court as to what they understood had occurred on this day. There was a difference in opinion as to whether a mental health act assessment had been conducted. The psychiatrists were of the opinion due to the brevity of time in which Stanislav was observed, merely walking past them into the house, an assessment was not done. This was at odds with the AMP who believed an assessment had been conducted. The next steps which were to be taken. Three of the professionals understood an application to the Magistrates court for a Section 135 warrant to allow entry into the property. This was not the understanding of the AMP who did not progress this action, having formed the opinion an assessment had in fact taken place. The court heard evidence the psychiatrists were expecting a further attempt to conduct an assessment later that day or the next day. On the twenty-sixth of January two thousand and twenty-one Stanislav's treating Consultant Psychiatrist became aware of the outcome of the mental health act assessment. Due to ongoing concerns in relation to Stanislav's mental health a further mental health act assessment was arranged for the third of February two thousand and twenty-one.

Meadows,Manchester City Area,Chief Executive Alternative Futures Group; Medical Director GMMH NHS Trust,"On the seventeenth January two thousand and nineteen I commenced an investigation into the death of Shona Christine Michaela Campbell. The investigation concluded on the seventeenth June two thousand and twenty-two.

The conclusion of the inquest was accident as part of a narrative conclusion","Shona had suffered psychological trauma as a child and had been treated by mental health services since the age of about 8. By the age of 18 Shona had an established diagnosis of a severe emotionally unstable personality disorder together with emotional dysregulation and was at high risk of impulsive behaviour that could lead to serious injury or death. She had a long history of self-harming but cutting herself with sharp objects and had multiple scars on her body.

Shona was transferred to Tesito House psychiatric unit from an acute psychiatric unit on the 22 January 2018. Tesito was operated by Alternative Futures Group. This is a not-for-profit charitable organisation that operates several psychiatric units. Tesito was a 24 bed unit in Ardwick, Manchester to treat and support women with complex needs which opened in 2017 but only cared for 8 patients. Services were provided in partnership with Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust.

Shona was a patient of Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust and was detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. This meant she was suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which made it appropriate for her to be detained in hospital in the interests of their own health and safety or the protection of others and that there was appropriate treatment available to her which could not be given unless she was detained in hospital. That remained her legal status. Her Responsible Clinician was a Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust Consultant Psychiatrist assisted by a locum junior psychiatric doctor who worked on weekdays. Multidisciplinary team meetings and ward rounds occurred frequently but sometimes were not attended by her named nurse and nor were the records of these kept appropriately updated and or reviewed.

At Tesito she was treated with antipsychotic medication, mood stabiliser drugs and antidepressants together with psychological therapies. Shona said that she heard voices of a persecutory and a derogatory negative nature as well as having visual hallucinations. These were not assessed to be genuine psychotic symptoms but represented intrusive thoughts when she became distressed. However, even if they were not psychotic related auditory hallucinations, she could still act upon them.

There were numerous incidents on repeated occasions particularly when she was emotionally distressed and or when she acted impulsively. Whilst on section 17 leave from the unit she had absconded on more than one occasion and also took overdoses of paracetamol for which she required hospital treatment. During one of the hospital admissions she was able to cut her neck she had kept from a previous home visit. Her mood and condition was very variable and she could change from being happy and stable to becoming distressed and self-harming extremely quickly. Sometimes she said that this arose out of frustration and that at other times because she wanted to kill herself.

The last formal risk written management plan was prepared on 16 October 2018 but was not regularly updated prior to her death. Her overall management was dealt with at multidisciplinary team and ward rounds. After a period of Christmas home leave on 25 December 2018 she returned to the ward intoxicated and expressing suicidal ideas. There were seven further incidents of her using ligatures between the 28 and 31 December and ligature cutters had to be used to remove them. On the 31 December she described hearing voices telling her to end her own life. There were further incidents of headbanging and on the 1 January 2019 during another incident of head banging she threatened to hit a member of staff who had attempted to remove items from her room in order to ensure her safety given the risk of self-harm.

Shona's ability to repeatedly access forms of ligature was said to be a matter of concern but there was no clinical management plan formulated to address the risk that this posed and investigate how this was occurring.

She was obviously cyanotic and suffering from asphyxia. Ligature cutters were used to remove the ligature. On the morning of 8 January, she was found to have ligatured again and resisted staff who tried to remove it. She ligatured it again within an hour and then once more in the afternoon. At the multidisciplinary team and ward round on 9 January her condition was noted to have improved and for the next couple of days she was stable but was still regarded as being at high risk of self-harm or suicide and was on 15-minute observations. The nursing staff had the discretion in the exercise of their clinical judgment to take such action as they thought were appropriate to protect her life.

During the early evening of 11 January, she was noted to be in happy and stable mood. At about 03:15 on 12 January she was found in the bathroom of her room with a ligature. This was removed by the use of ligature cutters although Shona resisted attempts to do this. She declined PRN medication and was preoccupied by using her phone but did not appear to be distressed. The nurse in charge decided not to put her on one-to-one constant observations but on random nature for shorter periods of time. She also decided not to search her room. Although the nurse in charge had last worked shortly before Christmas, she was aware of Shona's general history of self-harming behaviour and that she had also read and was aware of the records relating to the incidents that happened at the end of December 2018 and also on the 1, 7 and 8 January 2019. She was also aware that the use of ligatures by Shona could be fatal.

At about 04:23 she was found in her room just inside the door in a state of cardiac arrest with another ligature. Staff removed the ligature and began CPR. Although a defibrillator was brought to her room it was not used but it was not explained why. About 10 minutes later paramedics arrived and took over the resuscitation. There was a return of spontaneous circulation, but it was not necessary for them to use their defibrillator.

She was taken to the Manchester Royal Infirmary where despite treatment her condition deteriorated, and she died on 14 February. She died as a consequence of asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation.","The lack of appropriate contemporaneous clinical record keeping by the nurse in charge as well as other nurses. The lack of appropriate contemporaneous clinical record keeping by the support workers. Patient observations were not being completed as directed and accurate records were not being kept. There was inadequate communication between the nurse in charge and support workers about important clinical information relating to self-harm as well as completion of observations and the records. That patients could obtain ligatures and other objects that could be used for self-harm or suicide and or used against other patients and staff members.

The warnings Jack received were insufficient to prevent him gambling. The information available to Jack was insufficient to prevent him gambling or to inform him of the help and treatments available. The treatment available and received by Jack was insufficient to cure his addiction. This in part was due to a lack of training for medical professionals around the diagnosis and treatment of gambling addiction. Jack did not understand that being addicted to gambling was not his fault. That lack of understanding led to feelings of shame and hopelessness which in turn contributed to him feeling suicidal. Since Jack's death, whilst there have been improvements made in the areas of warnings, information, training and treatment, the evidence showed there were still significant gaps in these areas. One notable gap was the fact that evidence suggested GPs currently have insufficient training and knowledge to deal effectively with gambling problems. This was of particular concern given many gamblers affected are likely to contact a GP as their first attempt to seek help. The evidence was that young people were the most at risk from the harms of gambling yet there was and still appears to be very little education for school children on the subject.","""Jack William Ramsey Ritchie""; ""Jack had suffered a gambling addiction dating back to aged 17 a time when he was still at school.""; ""He died of multiple injuries.""; ""with the intention of taking his own life."""

Davies,Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly,"Chief Executive Officer, Youth Justice Board for England and Wales","On 14 September 2020 an investigation commenced into the death of 16-year-old Jake Adam Cahill. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 January 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows

Medical cause of death:

1(a) Hanging

The four questions - who, when, where and how were answered as follows:

Jake Adam Cahill died on 14 September 2020 at [REDACTED] Cornwall by [REDACTED] being an impulsive act in a moment of crisis, that was wholly unexpected and could not have been anticipated.

Short form conclusion:

Suicide","Jake had been subject to police investigations for a minor criminal offence committed in March 2020. The police issued a conditional caution which was administered on 4 September 2020. Jake was clearly upset at being issued with a police caution and having conditions imposed. Subsequently the local youth offender service sent Jake's mother some documents for completion. This included a self-assessment form, being a document produced by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales. The letter from the youth offender service instructed Jake's mother to pass that self-assessment form to Jake for completion. Jake's mother handed this form to Jake late in the evening of 13 September. The form was written in the first person and three questions were highlighted at inquest, with a yes/no box for completion. I have thought about hurting myself. I have tried to hurt myself. I have thought about killing myself. Jake ticked no for each of these questions. The following day Jake took his own life. In connection with the self-assessment form there was no evidence of any consideration being given to the need for sensitive questions raised in the form to be discussed with Jake by a professional before Jake completed the form. Evidence was taken from police on the subject of the risk assessment forms used by police. These forms do include questions whether an individual intends to harm or kill themselves. This form is never sent to individuals but is always completed by the individual with an officer present, that officer being required to explain and if necessary, contextualise the questions. The court heard that the guidance to the self-assessment form issued by the Youth Justice Board makes no express reference to the need for consideration to be given and documented as to whether the self-assessment form needs to be discussed with a vulnerable young person before completion of the form. The guidance examined at the inquest was a document entitled AssetPlus guidance v2.0. Jake had no history of any mental health conditions, or any history of self-harm or suicidal ideation. There was no evidence from friends and family of any warning sign as to Jake's state of mind. Toxicological examination was negative, in other words no drugs or alcohol were found in samples of blood taken from Jake after death. The police investigation had searched through Jake's browsing history. That enquiry revealed nothing of concern until the day of Jake's death 14 September 2020, by way of image caches captured on his browsing history as follows. I'm so done with everything. Do you just deep how alone you truly are sometimes. I want to die by hanging myself. How do I make sure that it works? Will it hurt? I made a finding of fact that the completion of that self-assessment form late on 13 September contributed to a moment of crisis for Jake the following day 14 September during which he took his life.",that there was no evidence of any consideration being given to the need for sensitive issues raised in the self-assessment form to be discussed with Jake by a professional before Jake completed the form that the guidance to the self-assessment form issued by the Youth Justice Board makes no express reference to the need for consideration to be given and documented as to whether the form should be discussed with a vulnerable young person before completion,"""16-year-old Jake Adam Cahill""; ""Short form conclusion: Suicide""; ""Jake Adam Cahill died on 14 September 2020"""

Travers,Surrey,Chief Executive Officer of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust; Chief Executive Officer of Surrey County Council; Chief Executive Officer of Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group; Chair of the National Child Safeguarding Review Panel; Secretary of State for Education; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,I commenced an investigation into the death of Oskar Miles Nash. The inquest concluded on the tenth September two thousand and twenty-one when I found that the medical cause of death was Ia multiple traumatic injuries and my conclusion as to the death was that Oskar Nash died as a result of suicide contributed to by neglect on the part of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. I subsequently held a hearing to receive evidence relating to the prevention of future deaths and this was concluded on the seventh December two thousand and twenty-one with time allowed subsequently for written submissions.,"Oskar Nash was 14 years old when he died. He had been diagnosed with autism at the age of 4 years and he suffered associated high anxiety throughout his life. It is likely that he also had one or more undiagnosed emotional or mental health conditions. Oskar had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both of which receded when his needs were sufficiently supported. Oskar was well known to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service and to Children’s Services, having been the subject of a number of referrals to both. His education was managed by the Special Educational Needs Department of his local authority as he had been issued with an Educational, Health and Care Plan. All state agencies concerned with Oskar had knowledge of his history of suicidal ideation. In March 2019 Oskar transferred from a special needs school to a mainstream school. Initially he appeared to cope, but from early November 2019 onwards, he regularly refused to attend school and a period of escalating risk followed. Referrals were made to CAMHS and Children’s Services but Oskar did not receive any effective support. On the ninth of January 2020, Oskar Nash gained access to an area of [REDACTED] and, a short time later, at about 17:06 hours, he deliberately moved [REDACTED]. His body was found the following morning.",A Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Concern 1 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff responsible for the triage of referrals to child mental health services had insufficient understanding of autism its links to co-morbid mental health conditions self-harm and suicidal ideation and how to communicate with an autistic child I have been told that the triaging process is now undertaken by an Access and Advice Team but I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff in that team to undertake relevant autism training on a mandatory basis Concern 2 The evidence at the inquest revealed that despite a series of referrals to child mental health services over many years Oskar Nash never received the clinical assessment he needed I have been told that the system now in place ought to result in a child such as Oskar being seen and assessed by a clinical team I am satisfied that the introduction of the Access and Advice Team in the context of the new Mindworks service is intended to ensure that a referred child’s needs are properly identified and met However on the basis of the evidence I heard at the prevention of future deaths hearing including from a special needs school which has experience of referring its pupils I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that some referrals may be inappropriately closed for example because the child at an early stage declines to engage or inappropriately referred to non-clinical partner agencies In this context I am concerned that there is a lack of specific monitoring of what proportion of referred children reach a clinical team and the extent to which the outcomes match the expectations of the referrers so that any ongoing barriers in the system which may be preventing proper access to the clinical teams can then be identified and eliminated Concern 3 The evidence showed that a referral to the child mental health services is triaged initially as being crisis urgent priority or routine The criteria for crisis urgent and priority referrals are specific and narrow and consequently the great majority of referrals are categorised as routine I have been told that the routine referrals are automatically categorised as low risk I am concerned about this as it is clear from the evidence that a child may not meet the criteria crisis urgent or priority but like Oskar Nash may nevertheless be at a high or medium risk of harm The Trust is currently receiving a high volume of referrals and so there is a considerable waiting time for its routine cases to be addressed It seems inevitable therefore that there are children in this category who have been wrongly assumed to be at low risk of harm but who in fact face a high risk of harm which is currently unrecognised and unmanaged Concern 4 I was told that the Standard Operating Procedure manual for the triage of referrals to children’s mental health services is to be updated to reflect the Trust’s new working practices but that this has not yet been done I am concerned that important changes to the system of work for example the vital requirement that a referred child’s records are reviewed before any triaging decision is made and the child family are spoken to are not yet established in written guidance Concern 5 The evidence at the inquest showed that the clinicians who were responsible for ensuring that Oskar Nash’s medical conditions including his risk of self-harm and suicide and his consequential needs were properly and sufficiently recorded in his Education Health and Care Plan failed to do so this was in part because they did not fully understand their role and obligations in this regard On the basis of the evidence at the prevention of future deaths hearing I am concerned that there continues to be a lack of understanding amongst the clinicians currently providing medical advice as part of the EHCP process as to their role in that process I am further concerned that there is in place no programme for the training or monitoring of these clinicians in relation to these responsibilities B Surrey County Council and National i Education and Special Educational Needs Department Concern 6 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in the Education SEN Department including SEN caseworkers had insufficient understanding of autism its links to co-morbid mental health conditions self-harm and suicidal ideation and how to communicate with an autistic child I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant autism training on a mandatory basis Concern 7 The evidence at the inquest showed that in the months before his death Oskar Nash was moved from a special needs school and placed into a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs I found that the inappropriate placement by SCC of Oskar into the mainstream school contributed to his death Prior to the placement the mainstream school had been provided with Oskar’s Educational Health and Care Plan but this failed adequately to identify and record his mental and emotional health concerns his risk of suicidal ideation his consequential needs and the provision required to meet those needs and it had not been updated to reflect a series of subsequent reviews of the Plan and significant subsequent events The mainstream school was not provided with any of the extensive and informative records from the special needs school from which he was being moved I was told by the mainstream school that had they seen the records held by his special needs school they would have recognised their inability to meet his needs and informed the SEN Department accordingly At the prevention of future deaths hearing I was told that it continues to be the case that a prospective school will usually be provided by the SEN Department with the child’s EHCP only Further it was apparent that there is a lack of clarity as to the extent to which a current school may or should provide records or information to a prospective school I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that placements of children with EHCPs are being made on the basis of inadequate information and record sharing On the evidence before me it was clear that even if an EHCP were comprehensive and fully updated which may not be the case it is unlikely to contain all matters of relevance to the question of a prospective school’s ability to meet the child’s needs I was given no good reason why fuller information and record sharing sufficient to ensure that the prospective school can properly assess its ability to meet the child’s needs should not take place before any child with an EHCP is placed in a new school I am concerned that there is no system in place locally or nationally to ensure this is achieved by the relevant SEN department for every child with an EHCP I am also concerned that there is an ongoing lack of clarity as to schools’ powers and duties to share information and documents and any data protection ramifications this may have ii Children’s Services Department Concern 8 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in SCC’s Children’s Services Department including Social Workers and other Team members had insufficient understanding of autism its links to co-morbid mental health conditions self-harm and suicidal ideation and how to communicate with an autistic child I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant autism training on a mandatory basis Concern 9 At the inquest I found that following Oskar Nash’s final referral to SCC’s Children’s Services Department which was made approximately two months before his death there was a failure to appreciate the seriousness of his situation and the risks arising and a consequential failure to allocate his case appropriately I found that this contributed to his death The inappropriate allocation resulted in part from the application of SCC’s then threshold of needs document which was used to inform the level at which support should be provided At the prevention of future deaths hearing I heard evidence about SCC’s revised threshold of needs document as well as the recent guidance including a toolbox in relation to suicidality which has been introduced since Oskar’s death Despite these changes I remain concerned that the threshold of needs document does not adequately and clearly reflect the known risks of mental health difficulties self-harm and suicidal ideation for autistic children given their prevalence in this group of children and that consequentially there is an ongoing risk that an autistic child in these circumstances will be allocated an insufficient level of support as was the case for Oskar C Surrey County Council and Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group and National Concern 10 At the prevention of future deaths hearing I heard evidence concerning the post-death reviews conducted into Oskar Nash’s death by the Surrey Child Death Review Partnership Team and the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership The evidence showed that neither process resulted in a sufficient or effective investigation of the death I consider that the evidence shows that fact finding was superficial there was no meaningful analysis of the part played by statutory agencies in the causation of his death and only very limited learning was identified Ineffective review by the child death review processes results in the risk of further deaths in similar circumstances and I am concerned that the local and or national process guidance and oversight are insufficient to ensure that an effective post-death investigation which should not be dependent on the inquest process is achieved in all cases D National Issues Concern 11 From the evidence I heard at the inquest and the prevention of future deaths hearing it was apparent that the national Working Together guidance focuses on children who are in need of safeguarding by reason of risks within the home or from other parental failures to keep the child safe It was apparent that the consequential approach tends to look critically at the child’s family and parent s and their parenting skills and that this is likely to be inappropriate if the child is in need through disability I consider that this had a detrimental impact on the approach of agencies to Oskar and his family I am concerned that Working Together does not provide clearer guidance specifically for the safeguarding of children with disabilities including autism and the approach to be taken by agencies to parents and families Concern 12 The evidence at the inquest revealed a widespread lack of knowledge and understanding of autism its links to co-morbid mental health conditions self-harm and suicidal ideation and how to communicate with an autistic child There was a lack of training across all the state agencies from which I heard At the prevention of future deaths hearing I heard evidence of more training being available but also of an ongoing absence of comprehensive relevant and mandatory training I was told that the National Autism Strategy does not currently include a timetabled commitment for relevant mandatory autism training to be provided to all state agencies working directly with autistic adults and children I am concerned that this poses an ongoing risk to autistic children and their ability to access the services they require for their support welfare and safeguarding,"""Oskar Nash was 14 years old when he died""; ""Oskar Nash died as a result of suicide"""

Narrative: Idris Habib took his own life when he hung himself in his cell B1 18 but his intention in doing so is unclear. On 16th November 2018 Idris Habib set a fire in his cell and stated that he wanted to kill himself. There was a failure to open an ACCT following this however it cannot be concluded that these factors contributed to his death.","Idris Habib was transferred to HMP Swaleside from HMP Pentonville on 15 November 2018. There were no issues identified on induction in respect of his mental or physical health, there was however a history of Habib expressing to prison staff that he was being bullied and threatened and requests to be moved or segregated. Shortly after arrival at HMP Swaleside Mr Habib indicated that he wanted to be moved from the induction wing as he was under threat from the people that he had been transferred from HMP Pentonville with. On 16 November 2018 he summoned assistance because he had cut himself whilst fashioning a weapon from plastic cutlery that he stated he needed for protection. An hour later he set fire to his cell. On both occasions he stated that he was being bullied. He stated at one point that he wanted to kill himself but did not repeat this when subsequently questioned following these events. He was given reassurance about his safety and was moved to a different wing. The prison investigated Mr Habib's concerns and found no evidence to support the allegation of bullying or threats. Over the next few days he self-secluded, rarely leaving his cell. Two other prisoners one a mentor agreed to look after him and provide him with support. At 7am on 20 November 2022 he was seen at the back of his cell at the early roll call. He was in the same position when the mentor prisoner went to see him and realised he was suspended. Cell B1-18 had been recently vacated by another prisoner and police who searched the cell after the death found containers belonging to a previous occupant. Quetiapine and trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride containers were empty when found but a box of simvastatin contained a blister pack with seven tablets inside. It is not known whether the other containers were empty when Idris Habib was placed in the cell.

The same onboard supervisor noticed Kaja boarding her train at Barnham station at 11.05am. Kaja got off at another station but the onboard supervisor was concerned about her welfare. The onboard supervisor invited Kaja to get back onto the train and then contacted the Govia Thameslink Railway control room raising her concerns about Kaja's vulnerability. The onboard supervisor did not report the concerns to the police and the Govia Thameslink Railway witnesses gave evidence that this would have been the recommended course of action. The Govia Thameslink Railway control room staff agreed that the onboard supervisor would hand Kaja over to the station staff at Havant train station. The control room staff then made contact with Brighton train station as Kaja's reported destination, Havant station and conductors on a number of trains. After Kaja had left Havant station the control room staff were not able to ascertain where she had gone. By 12.04pm the control room staff had been informed that Kaja was not on the expected train.

In addition refresher training on this issue was an aspiration only and had not been rolled out by Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd. I also heard evidence that the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd did not have any input into the training for their team based in the joint control room. I am therefore concerned that those members of staff most likely to have contact with vulnerable or suicidal persons, as well as those responsible for assisting frontline staff, are not all properly trained to deal with the situation in the best possible way. I heard evidence that Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd staff control room staff relied upon a protocol entitled Person ill on a train when a vulnerable person was reported to them. The witness responsible for the Govia Thameslink Railway control room team accepted that this was not an appropriate document to rely upon as it made no mention of vulnerable persons.

I heard evidence that the Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not log all actions taken after the concern for welfare report. I am concerned that it is not possible to assess whether all reasonable and appropriate actions were taken by the control room staff and whether individuals or teams have further training needs. The Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not contact British Transport Police 999 nor share the information about this concern for welfare report with Network Rail despite having a joint control room.

Mr Charlie Brian Todd was in HMP Durham and was admitted to SACU on 2 September 2019 just after 10am that day. He was found by staff members in his cell at 16:04 hanging by a ligature around his neck. Resuscitation was commenced but was unsuccessful and unfortunately, he was pronounced dead at 16:52 on 2 September 2019.","On 2 September 2019 Mr Todd, a prisoner at HMP Durham, was subject to an adjudication hearing which resulted in him being awarded a period of cellular confinement within the Segregation and Care Unit within the same prison. He was confined in a cell within the SACU that morning and was to be subject to regular hourly checks. At just after 4 pm the same afternoon he was discovered to have ligatured in his cell and despite efforts to resuscitate him, he died at 4.52 pm that day.","During the course of the inquest evidence was heard from a number of witnesses of the supervision and staffing arrangements within SACU. The overall position was that there was no supervising officer present on a day to day basis to ensure key tasks were always allocated or completed, and officers, including officers not posted to the SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various tasks between themselves on an adhoc basis.

On the 2nd September 2019 the document setting out which hourly checks had been undertaken in the SACU was incomplete. No check on Mr Todd's cell took place at 3pm that day.

Evidence was heard that staffing levels can vary, with officers being occupied on tasks which meant hourly checks could not always be completed.

Whilst there is auditing of the hourly checks retrospectively, there is no real time system which would alert officers and their supervisors to checks being incomplete for a prisoner as the record of checks are paper based and held in the SACU, as well there is no constant supervising officer present or other system there to ensure compliance.","""Charlie Brian Todd, 18 years""; ""he was found by staff members in his cell at 16:04 hanging by a ligature around his neck""; ""he was discovered to have ligatured in his cell and despite efforts to resuscitate him, he died at 4.52 pm that day"""

Concerned bystanders on a footbridge Queensbury and Sheerness Stations spoke to Ellis for about five minutes but he refused to climb back to safety. He jumped from the footbridge onto a railway track into path of an oncoming train with the intention of ending his life at approximately sixteen forty-one.

Ellis had a history of self-harm and suicidal ideation including thoughts of and attempts to end his life overdose, ligatures and with attempts to jump from a footbridge and in front of an oncoming train that required informal admission to hospital for approximately four months. Ellis had been diagnosed with depression and emotional instability and continued to have episodes of self-harm and thoughts of suicide. Ellis was under the care of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service on discharge in June two thousand and twenty, with support from Assessment and Liaison Outreach and had an agreed safety plan in place that included Ellis attend Accident and Emergency at hospital if he could not keep himself safe, even with the support of others. Ellis engaged with community mental health services, was taking prescribed medication, disclosed thoughts of suicide and did seek support to keep himself safe.

Ellis was rescued from an attempt to hang himself at home on the night of twenty-ninth September and had planned telephone psychiatric review the next morning with details of the failed attempt, that Ellis wanted to kill himself and could not keep himself safe. The psychiatrist instructed Ellis and his family to attend a pre-scheduled appointment at three o’clock with his care coordinator. This was a deviation from the safety plan that was not risk assessed and the care coordinator was provided with limited information of a self-harm attempt. When Ellis was assessed at the Seashells Unit he was found to be suicidal requiring a mental health assessment for admission to hospital. The care coordinator sought advice from her manager about the plan should Ellis refuse to go to hospital and was informed that she should call the police. Ellis refused to go to hospital and insisted he did not want to live and left the centre, leaving behind his telephone and tablet device so he could not be contacted. The care coordinator telephoned the police at approximately sixteen oh five who reported Ellis was missing and at imminent risk of killing himself and that he may attempt to travel by train to Faversham, his risks associated with jumping from bridges and in front of trains was not shared. The police updated British Transport Police at sixteen twenty-eight that Ellis may attempt to board to go to Faversham.","Ellis’s safety plan did not set out the responsibilities of the Child & Adolescent Mental Health Team and did not contain a contingency plan should Ellis agree to go to Accident & Emergency. On 30th September 2020 there was a deviation from the agreed safety plan without an updated risk assessment. Not all relevant information was shared between the Child & Adult Mental Health Team about the circumstances disclosed of events on the night of 29th September of Ellis’s failed attempt at hanging as part of a risk assessment. Ellis was found to be in need of a Mental Health Act assessment. Management advice was sought about risk and what action should be taken should Ellis refuse to go to hospital, the advice was contact the police. This advice did not take into account that Ellis had a history of absconding and that he could not be prevented leaving the centre.","""The conclusion of the inquest was suicide""; ""Ellis was under the care of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service""; ""Ellis was rescued from an attempt to hang himself at home on the night of twenty-ninth September"""

Marsh,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton",A2Dominion,"On the 27 January 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Kesia Blaine Waller, aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 May 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was cause of death 1(a) hypoxic brain injury and 1(b) hanging. Short form conclusions of suicide.","At around 21:09 on Monday 20 January 2020 Kesia Blaine Waller was discovered suspended from a ligature at her home address of [REDACTED] City Road, Winchester. She was taken to SGH where she was discovered to have a catastrophic hypoxic brain injury. Further treatment was deemed futile and life-sustaining treatment was withdrawn. Kesia sadly died in hospital on the 25th January 2020.","At Kesia's inquest I heard that her place of residence, City Road in Winchester, was a residential housing unit for vulnerable young people aged 16 to 21. The facility meets a housing need only for the young persons placed there. It was found on the evidence that A2 Dominion employees did not have sufficient training or tools, that is implements, in place to prepare staff for the situation that they faced on the 20th January 2020 when they found Kesia hanging in her room, nor could they carry out any physical actions to assist her, that is cut her down. There appeared to be no prior appreciation of the risks of self-harm, overdose or attempted suicide of residents, and so on discovering Kesia suspended in her room, the staff were inadequately prepared on multiple levels. I heard that whilst there has been additional training for the staff on areas of risk such as self-harm, overdose and or suicide, there have been no physical changes in terms of the provision of tools and implements that staff could use should they be confronted by a young person in distress and or in need of life-saving attention. It appears to me that without multi-factorial changes there remains a real and significant risk that staff at the residential units will remain unable to take any immediate and potentially life-saving action. The only tools and equipment that remain supplied is a standard home-style first aid kit which is entirely ineffective if a young person has suspended themselves from a ligature. Although additional training and courses have been added to both the induction training and ongoing professional development of staff within the residential units similar to City Road, I remain concerned by the way in which key policies and training are communicated and implemented as this does not appear to have changed. It was clear from the evidence that updates to policies are emailed to employees with a request that the employee responds to the email to confirm receipt. This proved to be wholly ineffective as what appeared to be expected by the company was that the employee would read, digest and understand the policy, and confirm when he or she had done so. The employee on duty on the 20th January 2020 was clearly unfamiliar with the appropriate policies and had only confirmed that he had received the email, which appeared to be all that was required, and not that he had actually read, digested and understood the appropriate policy or policies; how to apply them in practice and what was reasonably expected of him. Although enhanced risk training is now in place, it appears to me that without any enhanced diligence to ensure that policies are actually read and understood by those working face-to-face with the vulnerable young adults then the overall effectiveness of risk training and identification is severely flawed.","""aged 17""; ""Short form conclusions of suicide""; ""Kesia sadly died in hospital on the 25th January 2020"""

Moss,Cambridgeshire and Peterborough,British Transport Police; Network Rail,An investigation commenced on 5 February 2019 into the death of Christine Elizabeth Gould Chris aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 May 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was that Chris died by suicide when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train on 26 January 2019. Box 3 of the record of inquest recorded that Chris was an informal patient at the Darwin Unit for Young People Fulbourn Cambridge. Shortly after 6.30 pm on Saturday 26 January 2019 she was permitted to leave the hospital for a cigarette break. She did not return to the unit as expected but instead went to the nearby railway line. At about 7.35 pm Chris died when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train approximately 150 metres to the east of the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing. I gave a wider narrative conclusion together with factual findings delivered in open court. My narrative conclusion included that given the proximity of the Darwin Unit and also the Fulbourn Hospital and previous trespass incidents involving vulnerable patients Network Rail had made available a suitable and valuable facility for direct communication between CPFT and the signallers to slow the trains. Network Rail's fencing between and around the Cherry Hinton Bypass and Teversham Level Crossings was less than optimal. However it would be mere speculation to conclude that this contributed to Chris' death.,"My factual findings included that Chris may have accessed the railway line from the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing, from the Teversham Level Crossing or through or over the boundary fence between those level crossings. My factual findings further included that Network Rail had too readily assumed that Chris had accessed the railway via the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing. Both BTP and Network Rail fell into error in promoting that from a credible hypothesis into a firm assumption. Network Rail in written evidence had gone so far as to state that ""Access was made by Ms Gould at the crossing not via boundary fencing"". There was no proper basis for such a firm assertion of Chris' route of access and this detracted from the otherwise careful evidence provided to the Court by Network Rail. While compliant with standards, the fencing of the lower Class II type between the two level crossings near the Darwin Units should have been considered for upgrading given the proximity of the mental health units and the frequency of trespass incidents. The boundary fencing at the time of Chris' death was less than optimal given the known risks. It is to Network Rail's credit that they have now proactively decided to install 1.8m palisade fencing across the whole boundary area. The annual inspections reporting the fencing as being in good condition did not appear to have captured the frequent cases of damage to the top line of the fencing. Such damage may not have rendered the fencing as in poor condition, but it pointed to trespassing incidents which ought to have been fed back into the risk assessments for the area. In combination, the number of trespass incidents, and the frequent top-line level damage to the fencing should have led to the conclusion that the boundary measure was not preventing trespass. That should have led, but did not in fact lead, to the boundary fence being inspected every three months rather than annually. I noted that Network Rail had already indicated in evidence that it would in future be inspecting the fence boundary every three months.","Following completed suicides on the railway network BTP and Network Rail are both involved in considering further mitigating measures that may be appropriate at the location to guard against further fatalities. In Chris' case, earlier consideration to the fence boundary being a credible route of access may have led to the fence boundary being improved more quickly after her death. I am concerned that your investigation into, and consideration of, Chris' death did not keep a sufficiently open mind that she may have climbed the boundary fence to access the railway line. If similar assumptions are made in other investigations, there is a risk of future fatalities: there is a risk that mitigating measures will be missed if BTP and Network Rail too readily assume that one point of access to the railway was used when the evidence permits of credible alternative routes of access. Accordingly, I am concerned that action should be taken in the sphere of guidance in keeping an open mind in post-death investigations but the nature of any appropriate action to be taken is for your organisations to consider.","""Chris aged 17""; ""Chris died by suicide""; ""she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train on 26 January 2019"""

Moss,Cambridgeshire and Peterborough,The Royal Pharmaceutical Society; The General Pharmaceutical Council; The Company Chemists' Association; NHS England,"An investigation commenced on 13 September 2018 into the death of Samantha Jane Gould Sam aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 April 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was: Sam died by suicide by an overdose of prescribed medication. The main cause of Sam's death was her borderline personality disorder, which treating clinicians assessed to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood. The disorder caused a persistent but unpredictable and fluctuating risk of serious deliberate self-harm and suicide. There was a wider narrative conclusion, the aspect most relevant to this report being that: ""There was a systemic weakness and failing in the lack of a protocol for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service CAMHS and the GP service to communicate with local pharmacies concerning 16-18 year old patients with mental health conditions who were at risk of deliberate overdose. Sam was therefore able to pick up older prescriptions on 1 September 2018 without challenge. It was those medications that were fatal in the combined amounts Sam ingested on the night of 1-2 September 2018.""","There was a safety plan agreed with Sam's consultant psychiatrist whereby, although Sam was over the age of 16, Sam's parents would be responsible for her medication.

On 30 August 2018, Sam's treating psychiatrist in the community made a change to Sam's medication giving her a paper prescription. Sam expressed a preference to tell her mother about the change in medication new prescription of Topiramate directly and the psychiatrist had to make a judgement call whether or not to breach medical confidence and tell Sam's mother about this directly. On balance she chose not to. In the event, Sam did not tell her mother about the new prescription. Shortly before 1 pm on Saturday 1 September 2018, Sam instead went to her local pharmacy with the prescription for Topiramate and Lorazepam. She collected those medications as well as older prescriptions for other medications she would previously not have known were being held there. At her home on School Lane, Fulbourn at some time after 01.23 on the morning of 2 September 2018, Sam took a very large quantity of some of the prescribed medications. She went to bed, fell unconscious and died within at most a couple of hours.

The local pharmacy who do not have access to patients' records on SystmOne had not been told about the safety plan. As Sam was 16 years old, she was assumed competent to take her own prescriptions and the pharmacists had no immediate reason not to provide them to Sam, being ignorant of the safety plan.","There did not appear to be any national guidance or standards that directed or encouraged appropriate sharing of risk information and care plans with the local pharmacy. As a result, the pharmacy was unsighted on the fact that the treating psychiatric team had a safety plan involving Sam's parents being responsible for handling and administering all medication. Had the pharmacy been aware of this plan, it is likely that they would either have refused to provide the medication with which Sam overdosed or, at least, contacted Sam's parents or General Practitioner. A local protocol has now been introduced whereby the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ensures that any pharmacy used regularly by their patients aged 16 to 17 are where appropriate advised of relevant care plans, as well as the responsible GP being so informed. This is now to be part of mandatory training for CAMHS prescribing staff and is to be discussed in the local Joint Prescribing Group to ensure better communication between the local NHS Trusts, GPs and local pharmacies. Accordingly, action has already been taken in the local area to prevent similar fatalities. I am concerned that there is a risk of future fatalities if action is not taken at a national level to ensure that pharmacies are appropriately involved in medication safety plans for mental health patients aged 16 to 17, given that such patients may otherwise be able to obtain prescribed medication with which to overdose.","""Sam aged 16""; ""Sam died by suicide by an overdose of prescribed medication"""

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 November 2020. The determination of the inquest as to the medical cause of death was a massive head injury and multiple trauma owing to impact with a train, and as to conclusion, suicide.","In autumn 2018, Xuanze was a student attending Coventry University enrolled on a degree course in Architecture. He was aged 17, having been born on 10 December 2000 in the Heping district of Shenyang, China. He was living in student accommodation.

At Coventry University he was categorised as a Tier 4 overseas student. Due to his age and nationality he was required to have a guardian within the UK. A condition of his UK student visa was that he attended his university course. Xuanze's attendance on his university course was limited. Because of the amount of the course he missed he was sent a number of emails requesting his attendance at meetings with staff to discuss his absence. He did not respond to these invitations which resulted in an email being sent to him on 29 November 2018, indicating that he was at risk of being removed from the course and that he should attend a meeting to discuss this on 3 December 2018; removal from the course would in turn have affected his permission to remain in the UK on his student visa. There was no face to face meeting with Xuanze in advance of the email being sent to him on 29 November 2018, and neither Xuanze's family nor his guardian were informed that Xuanze was not attending his university course, nor were they informed of the meeting he had been requested to attend to discuss his removal from the course.

On 3 December 2018 shortly before 5 a.m. Xuanze left his student accommodation and went to Coventry Railway station. He walked to the end of platform one and proceeded along the side of the tracks. Approximately 500 metres outside of Coventry Railway station heading south, Xuanze was struck by a passenger train which caused him to sustain catastrophic injuries.

Following a serious overdose in February two thousand and fourteen he was thereafter placed in a succession of secure placements under the provisions of the Mental Health Act nineteen eighty-three and the Children Act nineteen eighty-nine until he returned to his home area of Chesterfield around Christmas two thousand and sixteen when he was placed, under the provisions of section twenty Children Act nineteen eighty-nine, in an unregulated placement for young people aged between sixteen and eighteen years of age and was also supported by local authority social care and child and adolescent mental health services. The Chesterfield placement was not a specialist placement for young people with autism or mental health problems and the placement had been made in the context of a specialist placement having given very short notice of termination of placement. There had been many episodes of self-harm following the overdose in February, some serious, including just two months prior to his death and he was assessed at ongoing risk of serious self-harm. The Chesterfield placement came to an end following Jacob's decision to move in to live with his father where he received ongoing support from the agencies.","Vulnerable young people aged 16 to 18 are being placed in unregulated placements. Any young person under the age of 18 placed in an unregulated placement is likely to have very significant vulnerabilities, and it is likely that young people with complex needs and at significant risk are being placed in such placements; indeed this was the case for Jacob. As the placements are unregulated there are no statutory regulations to comply with relating to competency and appropriate policies and procedures by the provider and there is no regulatory body to check and assess those providers. This is clearly a very concerning situation given the very high level needs that some of the young people will have. The lack of statutory regulation then places an onus on local authorities to check that a provider is competent and safe. Whilst in making individual placements it must be the duty of a local authority to satisfy itself as best as it is able that placements are safe, given the pressures on local authorities it cannot be the case that they are in a position to mirror the type and nature of inspection and oversight that might be provided by a regulator such as Ofsted.

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,College of Policing; Secretary of State for Education; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,On 17 January 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Katie Croft. The investigation concluded on 17 October 2019 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy 1b asphyxia from hanging,"Katie Croft was a vulnerable child who was a victim of abuse which she reported. On seventeenth October two thousand and eighteen Greater Manchester Police and Tameside Children's Services began an investigation. Katie was spoken to by both agencies having already given a detailed account to her school, which had reported the disclosure. The working together principles applied to the investigation which require that the voice of the child should be a focus for all agencies.

Subsequently Katie via her mother indicated she did not want to support a prosecution. The case was closed by Greater Manchester Police without being countersigned by a supervisor or any further face to face discussion with Katie or assessment of the evidence. A multi-agency strategy meeting was held and concluded Katie was being safeguarded. A child and family assessment was subsequently completed by an agency social worker from Children's Services without any further discussion with Katie. It was not shared with Katie or her family.

On eighteenth December two thousand and eighteen Katie disclosed to her form teacher that she was considering self-harm or worse. A cause for concern form was completed but subsequently misplaced. Action was taken to notify her parents of Katie's disclosure and her mother was spoken to. Katie had previously self-harmed. No further action was taken in relation to this disclosure. On eighth January two thousand and nineteen Katie sent her previous form teacher, who had left the school, a message via social media. She said she had no one else to talk to who knew what she was feeling and that she thought about the abuse every day and had cut herself the day before. The message was shared with the school safeguarding lead that evening and Katie was spoken to at school the following day. She denied sending the message.

She continued with lessons. School attempted to notify her family of the concern. After school she returned home. As a result of concerns raised by one of her friends school were contacted and contact was made with her family who tried to contact her and check on her wellbeing. Her friend went to check on her and found Katie suspended from a ligature at her home address.

She was resuscitated and taken to hospital. However she had sustained catastrophic brain damage and died at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital on fifteenth January two thousand and nineteen.","The inquest was told that GMP followed their own guidance which accorded with that of the College of Policing into the level of expertise of the officer allocated to investigate Katie's allegations. As a result of this the case was not dealt with by an experienced Public Protection or specialist sexual offences trained officer. It was allocated to a probationary police constable with approximately six months experience. The officer did not seize the phone which contained key social media contents until her third visit on the initial evening the offence was disclosed. The allocated officer was not experienced in joint working with social services or familiar with the concept of the voice of the child and what it would mean in such a case. At the time the decision was made by police to NFA matters there was no discussion about whether there could be a victimless prosecution; it was not established if the initial account was recorded on body worn footage or the extent of the social media contact by the suspect and the nature of any offences that could be revealed by those messages. No attempt was made to have a further face to face conversation with Katie

The Local Authority at the time were using a substantial number of agency social workers. As a result the Child and Family Assessment was not completed in accordance with best practice and not shared in accordance with expectations around best practice. The Local Authority has since made significant progress in moving away from a reliance on agency staff to fill gaps in social work cover. The inquest was told that agency social workers are still used extensively in other Local Authorities creating a risk that a similar situation could arise

At the safeguarding strategy meeting an officer allocated to attend such meetings on behalf of GMP attended rather than an officer allocated to the case. As a result the quality of information sharing and understanding of the allegation was more limited. On the particular police division in question this practice has stopped. It was unclear how common the approach is on a wider basis

It was accepted by witnesses for both the Local Authority and GMP that the voice of the child was not fully heard throughout their investigations. They via the safeguarding board commissioned an independent report whose findings and recommendations have been fully adopted by the safeguarding board. It was unclear what if any steps would be taken to disseminate the lessons pan GM or nationally

A further concern identified was that there was no mechanism for the school to be formally be aware of information within the Child and Family Assessment. As a result there was no formal follow-up procedure set out in the best practice national guidance the school was working within. The inquest heard that Katie's school recognising this gap has built on the working together guidance to develop guidance that ensures there is a proactive approach to engaging with a child and their family post the writing of a Child and Family Assessment

On the day Katie committed suicide she had attended a GCSE English class. The exam board required poetry syllabus was being studied that day. The lesson included a poem where the contextualisation of it included the use of suicide. The teacher delivering the lesson had no way of understanding the history of self-harm of Katie and her particular vulnerability when delivering a set text in accordance with the exam board requirements. It was unclear what if any guidance is given by the exam board to assist teachers minimising risk to pupils in this scenario","""Katie Croft""; ""conclusion was one of suicide""; ""Katie was a vulnerable child""; ""died at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital on fifteenth January two thousand and nineteen"""

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,Secretary of State for Health; Secretary of State for Education; Chief Executive of Stockport Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG); Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership,On eighteenth October two thousand and eighteen I commenced an investigation into the death of Oliver Sharp. The investigation concluded on the twentieth September two thousand and nineteen and the conclusion was one of narrative suicide contributed to by a failure by mental health services to recognise the increasing level of risk he presented as he transitioned from child and adolescent mental health services into the reduced provision and support available post sixteen,"Oliver Richard Sharp was a year ahead of his chronological age at school and excelled academically. Whilst at Manchester Grammar School he began to change his approach to school and his friends. He disclosed to a CBT therapist the extent of how he was struggling with how he felt about himself and his friendships. On seventeenth April two thousand and sixteen he disclosed he was self-harming. On twenty-first April two thousand and sixteen he saw the GP and was referred to CAMHS. On twenty-fifth April two thousand and sixteen Oliver took 48 Paracetamol tablets and disclosed that to his family who took him to Stepping Hill Hospital. He returned to school and continued under CAMHS. He was put on a six month waiting list for an ADOS assessment, which took place in November two thousand and sixteen and was inconclusive.

In September two thousand and sixteen he returned to year 11 at Manchester Grammar School. He was struggling to cope with the academic demands and there was a focus on trying to help him catch up academically and keep him safe. He showed signs of becoming concerned about failing and struggled to cope with friendship groups. The delayed ADOS assessment indicated he was not autistic. He continued to self-harm over Christmas two thousand and sixteen, and on second January two thousand and seventeen he took an overdose of paracetamol and was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital. It was agreed with CAMHS that a second opinion would be sought about him. The psychiatric assessment identified a complex picture including difficulties with emotional literacy and empathy. The overall diagnosis was of Autistic Spectrum Disorder ASD, ADHD and Emotional Behavioural Dysregulation. Following his January overdose, work continued with CAMHS and he returned to school. He became increasingly isolated and by the time of GCSEs he took only English and Maths but did not answer the papers. He left Manchester Grammar School and transferred to Beech Hall School in September two thousand and seventeen, dropping back to a year below his chronological age to repeat year 10. Over summer two thousand and seventeen he began to work with the Autism Team and they helped support him into Beech Hall School.

In October two thousand and seventeen he went missing from home and was found on a motorway bridge at 5am. He had not been taking his medication. Family therapy and sessions with his case manager continued. There were discussions about post 16 provision as he approached his sixteenth birthday. CAMHS within Stockport is a service for children up to 16. Discussions regarding discharge continued and because of the way in which Mental Health Services were structured the plan was to discharge to the GP. Overall he had settled at Beech Hall, although attendance was erratic. In June two thousand and eighteen the last family therapy session was due to take place. He had gone missing from home.

On twelfth June two thousand and eighteen he presented at Manchester Royal Infirmary seeking help having slept rough in Manchester and reporting thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to CAMHS for follow up. On fourteenth June two thousand and eighteen he told Beech Hall he was likely to harm himself if he went home. They took him to Macclesfield A&E where a detailed assessment and gathering of information resulted in him being admitted on a voluntary basis to the Hope unit. He arrived there at 1am on fifteenth June. He did not like it. He was assessed and was allowed to leave the unit on fifteenth June.

Following further psychiatric assessment from the unit whilst in the community he was placed on quetiapine. Concordance was initially good but deteriorated. The planned discharge from the Hope Unit services took place on second July two thousand and eighteen. On second July two thousand and eighteen he went missing from home and was found at Crewe Railway Station. The CAMHS plan was to discharge him and move him to the transition team which was discussed on twentieth August two thousand and eighteen. He was to have a new therapist.

On twenty-fourth August two thousand and eighteen he went missing from home. He was found and taken to Stepping Hill Hospital and assessed by RAID. He had bought paracetamol with the intention of taking his life. He expressed concern about his discharge from CAMHS. He was discharged to see CAHMS on thirty-first August two thousand and eighteen. He was due to return to Beech Hall on fifth September two thousand and eighteen.

On fifth September he was reported as missing from home. He was found by a member of the public in the early hours of the morning having taken an overdose of heroin. Medical intervention reversed the outcome of the overdose. He was assessed by the RAID team. There was a failure to consider the full circumstances of his history and a failure by mental health providers involved in his care to effectively communicate. As a result the level of risk he presented was not adequately understood. He was discharged to the Home Treatment Team.

The Home Treatment Team saw him on thirteenth September two thousand and eighteen. Professionals in his care recognised the increasing risk in relation to his behaviour. The Home Treatment Team failed to appreciate the level of risk he presented.

On the evening of fourteenth September two thousand and eighteen he presented at A&E at Stepping Hill Hospital with suicidal ideation. He was seen and assessed by RAID. There was a failure to fully assess him or understand the complexities and level of risk he presented. He was discharged home into the community to see the Home Treatment Team on fifteenth September two thousand and eighteen. He saw the Home Treatment Team on fifteenth, eighteenth and thirtieth September two thousand and eighteen. On thirtieth September he was discharged from the Home Treatment Team.

On eighth October at school he appeared to accept the reduced academic aspirations for him. A further reduced academic timetable was sent to him on twelfth October two thousand and eighteen.

On seventeenth October two thousand and eighteen he went missing from home. This was reported to Greater Manchester Police. On the morning of eighteenth October two thousand and eighteen he was found by a dog walker in Gatley Hill. A typed note was found on him. He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital and his death was confirmed. Toxicology confirmed that he had taken a fatal dose of heroin.","The inquest was told that the provision of mental health services post 16 varies widely across the country. In some areas there is a CAMHS 16-25 mental health service provision similar to the national 16 and under service whereas in other areas there a limited transition service or move back to primary care for re-referral to adult services. The inquest was told that this creates a cliff edge high risk situation for adolescents. The reason for the difference was resources and decisions taken by CCGs.

The inquest was told that it is important for autism to be diagnosed as early as possible so that appropriate support can be put in place. Early diagnosis was impacted by a national picture of long waiting lists for ADOS assessments. In Stockport there was approximately a six month waiting list for assessment. This was against a national picture of 12 to 24 month waits in some areas.

During the inquest evidence was heard that acceleration ahead of a chronological school age might cause relatively few difficulties in peer relationships up to about year 9 but post that as children entered adolescence it could become a significant issue impacting a child's mental health and ability to cope. Where it did happen, there needed to be an understanding by schools of the risks and early signs indicating a need for additional support to try to reduce the likelihood of self-harming behaviours and the potential need for additional support.

The inquest heard that Oliver had found the autism label and the label of disability that was attached to it very difficult to accept as time went on. There was evidence that particularly with high achieving children with autism the idea that they had a disability created additional challenge.

The language that it would have been more helpful to use widely would have been difference rather than disability.","""narrative suicide""; ""he was found by a dog walker in Gatley Hill""; ""his death was confirmed""; ""he had taken a fatal dose of heroin""; ""he approached his sixteenth birthday""; ""discussions about discharge continued and because of the way in which Mental Health Services were structured the plan was to discharge to the GP"""

Before his birth Torbay Children's Social Care had identified potential for his significant harm following his birth. He was known to the police by September 2002 when he was found playing alone in a park. Reports were made to Torbay Children's Social Care indicating that he had been neglected. At age five, consideration was given to long term care by Torbay Children's Services. In June 2007 approval was given for a kinship care in Essex. This was brought to an end at short notice and he was returned to Torbay. He spent several years in various foster care and respite care placements. The precise number of placements could not be identified. In January 2010 he was made known to the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service following his jumping a river and expressing a wish to die. On 18th September 2017 the deceased's then foster carer became concerned for his welfare, having found a note. The police were notified. The deceased was located on a viaduct by the police and taken to a place of safety for assessment. He was referred to the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service Crisis Team. The Crisis Team subsequently closed his support case. On 14th December 2017 he was accepted into the Torbay Autism Assessment Service. On 1st January 2018 the deceased told his then foster carer that he was going to visit a friend and would return at 7pm. The deceased visited his friend. The account of the investigating police officer is that he discussed ending his own life with the friend. At 7.01pm his foster carer received a text 'Dead at Berry Head'. The deceased's jacket was located at the top of a cliff at Berry Head. His dead body was at the foot of the cliff.","I ask please that your Department reviews the availability of resources to those Local Authorities which have a high proportion of young people in care and disproportionately few qualified and experienced staff.

Sam had been engaged with COMPASS services through a school referral. He had been referred to CAMHS in May 2018 but did not meet the threshold for engagement. His GP suggested other organisations who Sam could approach voluntarily for support, but he did not take up these suggestions.","Sam’s GP referred Sam to CAMHS when he presented to the GP with irritability, anger and a report that he was close to being excluded from school. CAMHS rejected the referral because Sam did not meet their threshold of moderate to severe mental health issues. CAMHS did not suggest any alternative assistance. The GP did follow up with Sam to signpost him to two independent organisations who Sam would have to approach independently for help. The GP made it clear in his evidence that there is a lack of lower level assistance for young people who present with ‘life issues’ such as low mood, irritability and anger issues, but who nonetheless need help and assistance but do not meet the criteria for access to CAMHS services. Sam had been referred to, and was receiving the services of COMPASS having been referred by his school. The GP was not made aware of this engagement and was unable to take this into account at the time when Sam did present himself to the GP. The evidence from COMPASS is that they maintain the confidentiality of patients even minors using their services unless they have express consent to disclose that information from the patient themselves. Without all relevant information neither the GP nor CAMHS was in a position to make a fully informed decision about Sam’s needs. Sharing of information between relevant health agencies to ensure fully informed decisions are made as regards the healthcare needs of an individual should be a priority. Evidence at the inquest from the GP also indicated that a reduction in healthcare provision at Sam’s school and in particular the removal of a medically qualified person has meant that confidential health information is no longer shared between the school and the GP surgery. The school now only engages first aiders, who are not medically qualified, and who do not therefore exchange information which in the past has proved essential in flagging concerns between the GP and the school. This is another route which has been closed and which would have allowed a potential flag to have been raised in respect of concerns around Sam and his wellbeing to be shared confidentially between GP and school.","""Sam Michael Carl Grant aged 16""; ""The medical cause of death was hanging from ligature around the neck""; ""Sam died on 9 November 2018 at home Milton Keynes having been found hanging by the neck"""

Rook,Surrey,The President of the Royal College of Pathologists,On 26 February 2019 I commenced an inquest into the death of Pte Geoff Gray. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was that Geoff Gray's death was by suicide.,"At approximately 01.10 hours on 17th September 2001 in the grounds of the Officers' Mess of the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, Surrey, Private Geoff Gray was found shot. Beside him was a SA80 rifle that was set to automatic, he had two fatal wounds to the head. Geoff was 17½ years old. At the very outset the assumption was made by attending civilian and military police and by the coroner's officer that this death was a suicide. A routine coronial post-mortem was requested and was performed on the day of Geoff's death. The examining pathologist was told the death was not suspicious and was not directed by the coroner to carry out a forensic post-mortem. The examination was therefore one of several bodies examined in that session. There were no investigating police officers present who could give further information to the pathologist if required albeit for training purposes two members of the RMP had attended. In the course of the post-mortem examination no photographs were taken; there were no x-rays or other imaging undertaken; a body map was not drawn; there was no attempt to reconstruct the skull or track the bullets; there was no attempt to match entry wounds to the relevant item of clothing a beret. The deceased's clothes were sent for destruction the next day rather than retained for chemographic analysis. The examining pathologist, who was a forensic pathologist, told me that generally photographs and x-rays would not be taken at a routine post mortem and that he would never do so. Other investigative inadequacies in the investigation of Geoff Gray's death were added to by the absence of either a forensic post-mortem, or at least additional steps being taken within a routine coronial post-mortem and the retention of Geoff's clothes. Two earlier deaths of young trainees from gunshot wounds at the same barracks in 1995 Private Sean Benton and Ms Cheryl James were also both investigated with routine coronial post-mortems. In Sean Benton's case I have earlier heard the fresh inquest into his death, which concluded in July 2018. His post-mortem was carried out by a general histopathologist, who had no experience of performing an autopsy after a death from high velocity gunshot wounds. At the inquest into the death of Sean Benton two expert forensic pathologists produced a joint report in which they agreed that much potentially useful evidence had been lost due to inter alia the absence of post-mortem photographs and the lack of adequate post-mortem description in relation to both the external and internal features of the gunshot wounds.","I instructed [REDACTED] as an independent expert in forensic pathology. He told me that the practice in Northern Ireland is that every firearms death, whatever the circumstances, will be subject to a forensic post-mortem. Both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem told me that there is no specific guidance to either pathologists, and as I understand it to coroners, that urges them to give particular consideration to the nature of the post-mortem examination in cases of death by firearms, even when that death is of a child. It is of concern that where assumptions of suicide lead to cursory post-mortem investigations this creates a risk that homicides will go undetected. The higher the possibility that homicides will be distinguished from self-inflicted deaths, the greater the deterrence to those who might have reason to try to make a murder look like a suicide. The use of a forensic post-mortem, or at very least something more than a basic routine examination in all cases of sudden death by gunshot may, by enhancing the quality of investigations and ensuring that assumptions of suicide are properly tested, reduce that risk.","""Geoff was 17½ years old""; ""the conclusion of the inquest was that Geoff Gray's death was by suicide"""

Davies,South Yorkshire West,"Chief Executive, Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust","An investigation was commenced into Noah Lomax’s death on 8 August 2018 and an inquest was opened the same day.

I concluded an inquest on 24 May 2015.","Noah was 15 years of age. At the beginning of July 2018 Noah’s mother was made aware of online communication between Noah and a friend in which he expressed an intention to take his own life by jumping off a bridge. Noah’s mother acted immediately upon this concern and both made an appointment for Noah to see his GP and to attend Door43 an organisation that provides emotional support for young people.

Noah and his mother attended the GP appointment with the specific intention to obtain help by way of a referral to CAMHS. Noah’s GP was told that he had suicidal thoughts and had plans to take his own life. Noah’s GP completed a written, non-urgent, referral to CAMHS.

CAMHS processed the referral promptly but the referral contained insufficient information for a risk assessment to be performed. Therefore, CAMHS closed Noah’s referral but invited his GP to provide further information. Noah’s GP planned to use the appointment arranged on 6 August 2018 as an opportunity to obtain the further information sought by CAMHS.

Noah’s family were not notified that CAMHS had declined the referral. The Trust accepted that the process of requesting further information was not sufficiently robust and that telephone contact with the GP should have been made. This would have avoided the need for a re-referral. Had the information been known that Noah was actively making plans to take his own life CAMHS would have categorised his appointment as urgent and seen him within two weeks.

Assumptions were made regarding the support being offered to Noah by Door43. The Trust accepted that the actual level of support ought to have been confirmed directly between CAMHS and Door43.

The Trust accepted that the current referral form does not capture the information required to process referrals without delay.

Noah went on holiday with his father and step-mother between 22 July and 29 July 2018. Noah was not seen by CAMHS on his return.

On 1 August 2018 Noah was not open with his mother about his plans. Instead of spending the day with friends he travelled, by a pre-planned route, to Conisborough Viaduct. Sometime after 1.30pm Noah took his own life by jumping from the Viaduct.","As I made clear during the inquest I was concerned about the adequacy of the CAMHS GP referral form. Noah’s GP was inexperienced she had not completed a CAMHS referral form before. She accepted that she had not provided sufficient detail in the form. This resulted in CAMHS being unable to assess Noah’s risk and declining Noah’s referral. This in turn meant that Noah did not receive an appointment with CAMHS before his death. The Trust’s investigation report stated that the evidence suggests that the current referral form does not capture the information required to process referrals without delay. The CAMHS clinical lead said that there had not been any other problems with the form with GPs not completing them sufficiently. I am not sure how the clinical lead is able to be so confident about this. I was told that redesigning the form had been considered by the Trust but was told that this was not the answer. Instead, further training has been provided to GPs within the area. Guidance is attached to the form to assist GPs in completing the form. Having carefully considered the evidence I am not satisfied that steps have been put in place to ameliorate the risk identified. Given the realities of the pressures on a GP’s day expecting a GP to use their 10 minute appointment to extract sufficient information for the referral and then at some point complete a referral form, with which they may be unfamiliar, creates the risk that relevant information may not be provided. I would invite the Trust to reconsider whether the form could be improved to reduce the risk of inadequate or insufficient information being provided which may result in a delay in care.","""Noah was 15 years of age""; ""Noah took his own life by jumping from the Viaduct"""

Ridley,Wiltshire and Swindon,Ms Margot James MP Minister for Digital and the Creative Industries Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport,On the 11th of January 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Bradley Robert Michael Trevarthen and an inquest into his death was opened by me on the 18th of January 2018. On the 25th of April 2019 I concluded Brad's inquest. I found that the medical cause of death was hanging. In box 3 in the record of inquest I recorded how when and where Brad came by his death as follows At some point after 1541 on Wednesday 10th of January 2018 Bradley hanged himself by the neck at his home in Durrington Wiltshire. He was discovered at around 1640 and despite advanced life support measures was confirmed as having died at 1812 at Salisbury District Hospital in Wiltshire the same day. Having considered the evidence I felt that there was insufficient evidence to make a finding of fact that on a balance of probabilities that Brad had intended to take his life at that time and I therefore recorded as a conclusion one of accident. Such a conclusion is recorded where a finding is made that someone has died as in Brad's case as a result of an unintended consequence of a deliberate act.,"It is fair to say that all unnatural deaths generally speaking are tragic but in the case of Brad it is even more tragic because Brad was a schoolboy and at the time of his death was aged 13. Having left school for the day on Wednesday 10th January 2018, Brad was subsequently found by his younger sister suspended from the bannister at his home in Durrington in Wiltshire at approximately 4.40 pm the same day. At about an hour earlier he had Instagrammed a friend in respect of which he was aware that a school friend of his had spoken to a teacher earlier that day and he was hopeful that he would get some support and help. A couple of Brad's friends had become increasingly concerned for Brad especially following their return to school about a week earlier and had spoken to the Head of Year that morning. I was satisfied having heard the evidence that an immediate risk of harm was not conveyed to the Head of Year and in fact one of the students who spoke with the teacher in evidence indicated that he personally did not think that Brad would go through with his actions and take his own life.

The evidence was clear that shortly before the return to school, for the spring term, that Brad's outlook had changed and when talking about self-harm and suicide Brad's tone took a more serious nature and this ultimately was of concern to his friends. As I am sure you are aware communication these days is not simply face to face and in the digital age there are many internet based communication platforms that people, especially young persons, use to communicate and one of those platforms was Discord and before returning to school Brad appeared to be expressing thoughts of taking his own life and this continued whilst gaming following their return to school. He actually indicated that he had made an attempt two days earlier but his friends for fear that their parents would ban them from using their electronic equipment did not communicate this to anybody.

What was apparent from the evidence was that Brad was becoming increasingly aware of the concept of suicide and exploring methods. There was evidence that pointed to him if not directly viewing the video footage taken by [REDACTED] (YouTuber) of a Japanese forest where people hang themselves, that he did enter and view discussions on the subject and also entered other discussion boards such as Reddit where suicide was being advocated for and advocated against and where methods were being discussed. It was clear to me that Brad was developing an unhealthy interest in relation to the concept of suicide and the means to achieve one's own death.

The reason why I did not return a suicide conclusion was primarily having regard to the Instagram message that Brad sent to his friend approximately an hour before he was found which did not point to an immediate risk of death and no note was left at the time. I found more likely than not that Brad was experimenting with the method, however, it is not commonly known that having placed a ligature around one's neck that it can compress nerves and blood vessels that can lead to unconsciousness in a matter of seconds and unless there is somebody there to cut you down the likely outcome is death.","My concern here relates to the internet and the regulation of it. Brad had access to the worldwide web however as with other cases that I am sure you are aware of that have been highlighted of late, my concern here is that some of the material Brad was exposed to was of a nature that a young person of his age should not be exposed to as they cannot, in my view, properly assimilate and process the information that they view. The amount of information on the subject of self-harm and suicide that is currently available to young persons on the internet goes beyond freedom of expression and I am concerned that the extent of such information normalises actions which at the end of the day are simply not normal. It is not normal to self-harm and it is not normal to perform an act which results in that person's own death.

I fully appreciate that the responsibility does not rest solely with Parliament, but the control of this entity has to start somewhere although I fully accept that to counter such activity will involve the combined efforts of Parliament, internet service providers, internet site owner, schools and colleges, parents/guardians as well as the young person's themselves.

I can take judicial notice of when I was growing up that I do not recall ever discussing self-harm and suicide in the same way as it is discussed now, and I fear that the abundance of this type of information and the ease of its accessibility is leading to this concept of normalisation of such actions. Yes, it is totally right that we should be open about mental health issues but the abundance of information that is out there on self-harming and suicide methods is a step too far hence my concern.","""Brad was a schoolboy and at the time of his death was aged 13""; ""Brad hanged himself by the neck""; ""confirmed as having died at 1812 at Salisbury District Hospital"""

Narrative conclusion

Aryan Akghar died on 6th March 2018 in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield following an incident on 16th February 2018 when he hanged himself from a self-administered ligature with the intent to take his own life.

Aryan’s death occurred against a background of four serious attempts to take his own life on 3rd January 2018, 6th January 2018, 9th January 2018 and 11th January 2018. Aryan was assessed on 9th January 2018 by specialists from the Adult Mental Health Trust in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield and discharged home to his family. That assessment recommended an urgent response and visit the next day by the Home Treatment Team. The Home Treatment Team declined the referral because Aryan was under 18. The STAR team in CAMHS did not at that time provide an urgent response service. The first visit by mental health professionals to Aryan therefore was not until 15th January 2018 because of this gap in provision.

Aryan was seen by the STAR Deliberate Self Harm team on 15th January 2018, 21st January 2018 and 3rd February 2018 and was then discharged. Aryan then hanged himself on 16th February 2018.","Aryan’s medical cause of death was due to hanging. All witnesses accepted that there was a gap in services for Aryan and, notwithstanding the evidence of the Medical Director of the Sheffield Children’s Hospital, I remained concerned that difficulties in securing funding might jeopardise his proposed solution.","A gap in services was identified for 16 and 17 years olds with urgent mental health issues, such as Aryan had. On 9th January 2018, Aryan was assessed as requiring urgent mental health input, commencing the next day. This was not available as a service for under 18s in Sheffield and Aryan did not receive any contact from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) until 15th January 2018. In evidence I was told that additional resources in the CAMHS service were close to agreement in order to prevent this kind of problem arising in the future. However, this would be subject to a commissioning process from the Clinical Commissioning Group for Sheffield which could not be guaranteed. It was accepted in evidence by the Medical Director of the Sheffield Children’s Hospital on behalf of CAMHS that such additional resource was required.

This avoids potential delay in the inquest process and further distress to the family.

Some action has been taken by NSFT in this respect, not least in that the team is now better resourced staff-wise. Further action has been and is being taken to ensure staff appreciate the importance of full record keeping. An audit of the records has been undertaken to ensure full compliance with record keeping requirements but this will only continue until 100% compliance has been achieved.

Concern remains in that staff do change over time and matters raised now do not necessarily remain at the forefront of an individual's mind, especially when under time pressure. Good record keeping is an integral part of any good service and must be second nature to all staff. It must be fully appreciated by all as a vital component in the management of risk. Further, record keeping has been raised elsewhere as a matter of concern within NSFT.

I have concern that full record keeping and disclosure requirements will not remain a priority.

Communication with external agencies

An initial full, updating letter was sent to Ellie's GP. However no further updating information was sent. A letter was written providing updating information, but this was not sent. No further updating information was sent to the GP by telephone, letter or email.

The evidence heard is that efforts were made to contact the school by telephone. However, the school had no record of any such calls. There is no evidence of email or written correspondence or further telephone calls in an effort to communicate with the school.

It is accepted by the Trust that sharing of relevant information is necessary. NSFT has indicated it will remind staff of the importance of recording efforts to share information maintain communication.

Sharing of information and communication with external agencies is a matter which has been raised with NSFT on previous occasions. The importance of recording efforts to share information may not be sufficient to prevent future deaths. It is the importance of sharing information and communicating with external agencies that should be addressed here.

It was explained to the court that the school filters are accessed via Smoothwall which provides age appropriate filtered content. Whilst Ben could not access these pages as they were blocked, there was no mechanism in place at the time for the school to be made aware that a pupil may have attempted to search for such pages. The court heard evidence that at the time of Ben's death the only monitoring was in lessons and was solely reliant on the teacher trying to watch what students were doing. The school has 900 pupils and the court heard in any one day there can be 12,000 attempts by pupils to access blocked content. Not all of these would be as concerning as the content Ben was trying to access, some may relate to social media pages which the school does not allow. Evidence was provided to the court that since Ben's death, Smoothwall have now upgraded functionality and staff now receive notifications when blocked high risk safeguarding categories are attempting to be accessed. These alerts are real time notifications and go to three identified members of staff. Since this installation staff have been notified of two other children attempting to access similar sites to Ben and have taken action to speak to them and also to speak to their parents to offer support. However it is not known if this functionality is mandatory for all schools or indeed whether other software providers who are used by schools have this option.

Wilcox,Inner West London,"Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director, NHS England; Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP, Secretary of State for Health, Department of Health; Paul Rees, CEO, Royal College of Psychiatrists; CNWL CCG Chair, Central & North West London NHS Foundation Trust",On the third October two thousand and eighteen evidence was heard touching the death of Maximilien Conrad Kohler Max had been found deceased hanging by a belt around his neck from a pull-up bar positioned across his bedroom door at his home address He was fifteen years old at the time of his death The findings of the court were as follows Medical cause of death Fatal pressure to the neck How when and where the deceased came by his death Max suffered with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Syndrome At times symptoms of ASD would overwhelm him and he would attempt to take his own life or self-harm On the fifth May two thousand and eighteen he was found hanging by his father at his home address Despite resuscitation his life could not be saved and he was recognised as life extinct at 07:23 He had left two messages expressing intent and demonstrating capacity Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death He took his own life whilst suffering from Autistic Spectrum Disorder,"Evidence taken at the inquest confirmed that Max had not been diagnosed with ASD until he saw a third and very experienced Child and Adult Psychiatrist, at least in part because Max was clever and able to cross compensate for the issues that the ASD caused him and instead had been incorrectly diagnosed with depression and bulimia nervosa, of which there was no evidence when he was assessed at length in an inpatient setting. These diagnoses had at least in part been arrived at by the use of questionnaires. Expert evidence was taken and accepted by the court that the earlier misdiagnosis may have been contributed to by the latest fashion in mental health to over rely on questionnaires and perhaps less upon clinical evaluation of the whole picture presented by the patient. It is possible that such over-reliance can contribute to misdiagnoses and underestimate risk.

The over reliance on the use of questionnaires to assess the risk of self-harm, compared to full psychiatric history taking and evaluation of the patient in the round by a clinician with experience has been a repeated theme in inquests.

It was also discussed and accepted by the court that the current training regime for the training of specialist doctors is shorter than it was in the past so that doctors now become consultants with far less experience at senior registrar level, and consequently less exposure to and skill with diagnostics across the range of psychiatric conditions.

Further it was discussed and accepted by the court that there is a relative paucity of services for conditions which are chronic and difficult to treat and cure compared to illnesses which respond to short term therapies, and so show easily auditable improvements in health with the application of evidence based guidance.

This was considered by the expert and accepted by the court to reflect the style of commissioning of care by CCGs who wish to support and prioritise the services to relatively easily treatable conditions.

ASD was accepted to be a lifelong incurable condition which responds only to long term supportive care, and so to have expensive and resource rich treatment requirements. As such ASD would come towards the bottom of the pile for CCG commissioned treatment and care.

The expert stated that care provision is even worse for adults with ASD and other similar conditions than for children.

Max's parents gave extensive evidence in relation to the support and information that they have received since his suicide compared to the time when they were trying to care for him whilst he was alive. They described a lacuna in support and educational provision for parents attempting to assist a child with ASD.

When Max needed urgent inpatient admission there was no bed available in London in Child and Adolescent psychiatric services, and if his parents had not been able to access private health care he would have needed to have been hospitalised in Sheffield.

A report from CNWL, accepted by the court, stated that a new facility is currently being built to provide psychiatric beds for children and adolescents in West London, but this cannot alone address the scarcity of provision across the rest of London and England.",That delays in diagnosis and misdiagnosis in medicine due to reduced time in training for doctors in general and psychiatry in particular may imperil the lives of vulnerable patients That over reliance in the current fashion on questionnaires used in diagnostics and management may impede rather than assist doctors and other clinicians firstly to arrive at the correct diagnosis in the first place and secondly to cause or contribute to underestimation or proper evaluation of the risk of self harm in particular That the NHS care commissioning structure is biased against the commissioning of services for chronic incurable conditions in general and ASD in particular That there is a lack of support and education available for parents caring for children with ASD That there is a severe shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for children and adolescents in the NHS That services for adults with ASD are even less well provided for by the NHS than those for children,"""He was fifteen years old at the time of his death""; ""He took his own life whilst suffering from Autistic Spectrum Disorder"""

Although this change was communicated orally to Katy and her family, it was not confirmed in writing and little, if any opportunity was provided to appeal this decision to alter Katy's care plan, despite the family's increasing concerns over its appropriateness for Katy.

Roberts,County of Cumbria,Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust; North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group; Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,On twelfth April two thousand and seventeen I commenced an investigation into the death of Karen Jane Edgar. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on thirteenth April two thousand and eighteen. The conclusion of the inquest was Karen was suffering from emotional and behavioural issues and was referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services CAMHS in October two thousand and fifteen aged fifteen. Her first substantive meeting with her mental health practitioner was on eighth February two thousand and sixteen when family work was planned. She did not start individual talking therapy until seventh April. Family therapy had ceased to be available. After only one more one to one session on twenty fifth April she was on fifth May seen by a psychiatrist who prescribed fluoxetine ten mg. In July it was increased to twenty mg. On twenty ninth September she took an overdose of paracetamol then raised the alarm and received inpatient general hospital attention. Her true intention was not clear. The psychiatrist changed her medication to sertraline fifty mg which commenced on about seventh March two thousand and seventeen after only twelve one to one sessions. On twenty second March she was involved in an outburst at school relating to her boyfriend from whom she had split in February. At the one to one on twenty ninth March she was angry and upset and later that day researched suicide note on the internet. Sertraline was increased to one hundred mg on thirtieth March. She had convinced herself she was pregnant and told her former boyfriend on first April. She admitted to a friend having tried to hang herself. On the evening of seventh April she had an angry exchange with her former boyfriend over the pregnancy issue via text and went home. Whilst her parents were not in the house she hanged herself from a dressing gown cord in a wardrobe in her bedroom. She was discovered soon afterwards but despite medical treatment did not recover and was pronounced dead at West Cumberland Hospital at 01 10 hours on eighth April. She had made a cut in the ligature with a pair of scissors. Medical cause Hanging. Conclusion Misadventure she hanged herself as a gesture intending to be discovered.,"Karen had been displaying behavioural and anger problems for many months when there was a major incident in August 2015 which resulted in her and her parents seeking help. Despite a referral to CAMHS in October 2015 assessment appointments did not take place until early December and January. Family work was proposed but only two meetings took place before it ceased to be available. Karen did not start one-to-one work until April 2016, nearly six months from first seeing her GP. She only had thirteen talking sessions from the first assessment in December 2015 until her death in April 2017. The psychiatrist diagnosed her with moderately severe depressive disorder and prescribed antidepressants after only two one-to-one sessions. NICE suggests four to six sessions. She was not monitored closely on four drug changes. It remains an open question as to whether the introduction of sertraline a month before is implicated in her death. Whilst the mental health worker did her level best it seems that the resources were inadequate to support Karen and she received sub-optimal care. The Trust's own report revealed a long list of failings including no care plan, lack of packages of care, gaps in workforce and skills base, absence of family therapy, failure to re-assess risk formally, lack of multi-disciplinary meetings, absence of holistic approach and not engaging more productively with her school. Many of these issues were themes found to be endemic in the Trust by the CQC in its report of twenty-sixth January 2018.",The provision of mental health services for children and young people in Cumbria is underfunded. There are long delays in getting treatment. Failure to provide for these young people means they risk entering adulthood with unresolved mental health issues.

Slater,Sheffield,Ms Louise Slater Assistant; Office of H M; The Medico-legal Centre,On 25 April 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Miss Daisy French. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 November 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was that Miss French died from multiple injuries and Asperger’s syndrome. A narrative conclusion was recorded as follows: Daisy French died as a result of injuries she received when she was struck by a train at Meadowhall Railway Station. Daisy deliberately placed herself in front of the train but due to her mental illness it is unclear whether she intended to take her own life at this time.,"Daisy was 12 years old when she was first referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in January 2013 following an overdose. Daisy had several and some lengthy admissions to the Becton Centre, a specialist in-patient facility for children and young people with serious mental health issues. Daisy was diagnosed with depression, Asperger’s syndrome and non-organic psychosis. Due to the diagnosis of psychosis, Daisy’s care was to be transferred from CAMHS to the Early Intervention Service (EIT) which is an adult psychiatric service. This transition started when Daisy was 15 years of age. Consultant Psychiatric confirmed this transfer to adult services is in accordance with national guidance but Daisy found this transition difficult and her mental health deteriorated. Daisy was restrained by British Transport Police at Meadowhall Railway Station on the 29th November 2016 and the 15th March 2017 because she was trying to get on the tracks, both times she was detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act and taken to Maple Ward which is an adult psychiatric ward at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield. Explained that all out of hours mental health services for 16 year olds is provided by the adult services. Therefore, although Daisy was well known to the CAMHS and still under their care, when issues occur “out of hours” she was to be considered an adult and therefore was taken to and assessed by Adult Services. The evidence of the adult service practitioners is that they cannot access any CAMHS records and therefore could potentially go into a mental health assessment of a 16 to 18 year old “blind”. The practitioners confirmed that was problematic. Although, because Daisy was transitioning between CAMHS and Adults Services they did have access to some records because they can access all adult services records on their own system called “Insight”. In addition, when Daisy’s mental health deteriorated further because she was now aged 16 years she was admitted to a Crisis House for adults rather than being able to access the CAMHS provision or support. Finally, Daisy wanted to try and live independently and a placement was arranged for her to reside in a Young Women’s Housing Project. During this placement Daisy was detained under section 136 after trying to get on to the track at Meadowhall Railway Station on the 15th March 2017. Daisy was again taken to the out of hours adult services and was assessed as not requiring detention and she was released back to the housing project where there are no staff on duty. Daisy continued to struggle with her mental health and the transition from CAMHS to adult Services. On the 19th April 2017 Daisy deliberately placed herself in front of a high speed train at Meadowhall Railway Station and died as a result of the injuries she sustained.","The communication/information sharing between CAMHS and Adult Services.

Voisin,Avon,Avon & Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust; Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust; NHS England,On 28 July 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rebecca Jay Romero aged 15 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 December 2017.,"Rebecca Romero died on nineteenth July two thousand and seventeen at her home address. She had been found in the bathroom with a ligature around her neck and she died from the injuries sustained. Rebecca had been discharged from a psychiatric unit on fourteenth July two thousand and seventeen and was under the care of the community team at the time of her death. She had not been seen since her discharge. Rebecca had a long history of self harm and mental health problems; she was described as appearing very vulnerable with very few factors of resilience. In June two thousand and sixteen she began using ligaturing as a means of self harm. It was agreed by a number of witnesses that that elevated Becky's risk. On tenth June two thousand and seventeen she was admitted to Pebble Lodge Adolescent Unit in Dorset as there were no beds for her in the local area of Bristol at the Unit called Riverside. On sixth July she was released for a period of leave; what in fact transpired was she never returned to Pebble Lodge after this period of leave. On fourteenth July there was a discharge meeting and a community care package was put into place. I was told that the original plan was to arrange to transfer Becky to Riverside but as there was no place available attempts were made to discharge her to Riverside as a day placement patient. Unfortunately there were no day placements available either and therefore a community care package was put into place. One witness described the community care package as ""it just didn't feel very comfortable."" Furthermore the evidence at the inquest from NHS England was at the time of Becky's discharge that a day patient placement was available at Riverside. An independent witness also gave evidence at the inquest and said he was concerned about the length of time that Becky was without a medical review and that post discharge was at a very high risk time. He stated that the amount of contact from the sixth July to the time of her death was not acceptable and that the plan to see Becky once a week following her discharge was not sufficient. A number of other points were raised at the inquest as follows: in relation to the transfer from Pebble Lodge to Riverside it appears that a Form 1 was submitted to Riverside on fifteenth June but that the referral was closed on sixth July. There appeared to be confusion by some as to whether this was being followed up. The community care plan that was in place from fourteenth July had no dates for tasks to be completed or for meetings to take place, by way of example at the time of her death a medical review appointment was still not in the diary. Different people described Becky's risks in different ways, terminology such as low, medium or high were used to describe her risk but others used significant or low and even on the date of discharge her risks were described in different ways. Part of the care plan was for there to be communication by text with Becky up until the time of her death there was only one text sent which was effectively confirming an appointment for after her death and simply stating ""how are you"". I was told that there is no current training or guidance given to staff. This case highlighted some of the difficulties in transferring children to an in-patient unit out of the area and then arranging to transfer them back to the area.",In this case there was confusion as to whether on an in-patient transfer there should be a Form 2 to go alongside the Form 1 procedure. As well as clarifying this process with all providers concerned consideration should be given that a clear documented process is put in place for in-patient transfers so that all those involved understand clearly the situation and the decision made in relation to the patient. Consideration should be given to ensuring that all care plans are time specific so that dates of meetings or dates for tasks to be completed are set at the time of the meeting so again expectations are managed and everyone knows exactly what the plan is and when actions will occur. That the issue of inconsistent terminology when assessing risk is reviewed to ensure a consistent approach. In this case there were a number of different phrases and gradings used to determine the deceased's risk. That consideration should be given to training and or guidance issued for staff communicating with young persons by text or any means of social media. Consideration should be given to reviewing whether there ought to be guidance issued when managing children who go out of area for psychiatric in-patient care and further guidance issued in the management of children when returning to their local area when they have been an in-patient out of area. Whether certain steps should be taken to ensure best practice and a consistent approach e.g. risk assessing; face to face meetings; robust care planning; parental involvement; how best to re-integrate back into the local area/team.,"""Rebecca Jay Romero aged 15 years""; ""Rebecca Romero died on nineteenth July two thousand and seventeen at her home address""; ""She had been found in the bathroom with a ligature around her neck and she died from the injuries sustained"""

Ellery,"Shropshire, Telford & Wrekin","Mr Neil Carr OBE, The Chief Executive of South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Trust",On 31 January 2017 commenced an investigation into the death of Jeff David Antwis 14 years of age The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 November 2017 The conclusion of the inquest was suicide,On Monday 30 January 2017 at approximately 05:30 hours a train travelling south along the railway line at Harlescott level crossing Shrewsbury struck the deceased causing serious head injuries. He was transferred by ambulance to the Royal Stoke University Hospital where at 17:18 hours he was confirmed dead. The deceased was a vulnerable teenager with a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome with a history of self-harm escalating to suicide attempts. In answers to a miracle question he indicated that he wished to die. An urgent medical review was appropriate but not carried out however it cannot be said to have caused or contributed to the death.,Following an urgent referral by Jeff's GP to the then Shropshire CAMHS on the 10th January 2017 a timely response was made with an initial appointment with a mental health practitioner taking place on the 12th. A further appointment was arranged for the 25th January an earlier date clashed with an existing medical appointment and in the meantime Jeff was given a miracle question to complete. Jeff answered the miracle question indicating that he wished to die. He passed it to his mother who immediately contacted the mental health practitioner who in turn referred it and the initial assessment to a consultant physiatrist for review. The consultant physiatrist did not consider the matter urgent and arranged for a routine medical review for the 17th March 2017. At the second meeting on the 25th January 2017 Jeff and his mother were informed of the appointment for the 17th March 2017. Jeff's mother immediately raised concerns and asked for it to be brought forward. She was told she would have to write in and make a complaint. This was a time sensitive situation adding to the problem without resolving it. On the 30th January 2017 Jeff killed himself on the railway line. Independent expert evidence from a child and adolescent consultant physiatrist indicated that Jeff should have been offered an urgent medical review appointment for the 27th January 2017 i.e. within seven days of the internal referral to the consultant physiatrist and not as a routine appointment the 17th March 2017. It cannot be said that such earlier appointment would have addressed Jeff's problems and altered his wish to die but it is it possible that earlier intervention may have lifted his spirits and not according to his mother wilted. It undoubtedly would have helped and at least been an earlier step in seeking to help Jeff. Other matters of concern arose from the evidence. The mental health practitioner was aware of the deliberate self-harm protocol but not its content. Carried out a risk assessment on a subjective basis without reference to any known definition e.g. serious or significant. Had no mechanism for referring back to the consultant physiatrist appointment whether she agreed with the request or not. As stated Jeff had a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome with autistic spectrum disorder. Concerns were raised to what extent these conditions may have masked Jeff's suicidal ideation on presentation and to what extent if it is the case they were recognised. From evidence given at the inquest it is clear that the provision of child and adolescent mental health service is in transition having moved from Shropshire CAMHS to part of South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Trust. Certain actions are already being taken and these concerns are raised so that a holistic approach can be taken and fed in to what is already an ongoing wider review.,"""Jeff David Antwis 14 years of age""; ""The conclusion of the inquest was suicide""; ""On the 30th January 2017 Jeff killed himself on the railway line"""

Williams,Somerset,"Head of Services CAMHS West; The Managing Director, NHS Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group; Director of Children's Services, Somerset County Council","On 22nd September 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sofia Ann Legg. Sofia was aged 14 years when she died on 26th September 2016. The medical cause of death was hanging. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, that on 20th September 2016 at 25 Saxon Way, Cheddar, Sofia deliberately suspended herself by the neck with the intention of ending her life.","Sofia had previously suffered from low mood. In Year 8 both school and family noticed significant changes in Sofia's behaviour, including self-harming. Sofia's mother was sufficiently concerned to attend the family GP who wrote to CAMHS West supporting a referral from Sofia's school. By letter dated 2 April 2015 CAMHS West stated that Sofia's difficulties did not meet criteria for specialist CAMHS intervention. In February 2016 Sofia attended her GP with her mother, Sofia's hair was starting to break, her self-confidence fell as her hair became thinner. Sofia and her mother returned to the GP a number of times and in June 2016 the GP agreed if Sofia was stressed, it was documented that Sofia has been low for months, was self-harming again but denied any suicidal thoughts. Following an attendance at the GP on 12 July 2016 it was noted that Sofia has expressed some suicidal thoughts. An expert referral was made to CAMHS West. Sofia was seen by a care coordinator at CAMHS West on 15 July 2016 and again on 29 July 2016. Sofia was given the opportunity to speak to the care coordinator alone. Sofia was placed on a six month waiting list for CBT. Sofia appeared to her mother to have a good summer holiday but upon returning to school in September 2016 Sofia started to isolate herself. Sofia's mother arranged an appointment with Sofia's care coordinator at CAMHS on 19 September 2016. Again Sofia had the chance to speak to the care coordinator alone and again Sofia admitted to suicidal thoughts. From the evidence of the care coordinator and Sofia's mother it was identified that there was a difference in recollection of what was discussed and expressed at that meeting. Matters that the care coordinator identified as discussed were not subsequently identified in Sofia's care plan, the care coordinator has no urgent contact with Sofia's school and no urgent contact with a psychiatrist. No follow up appointment was made. On the following day 26 September 2016 Sofia's mother following discussions with Sofia attended work and upon return home discovered Sofia hanging. Sofia left an apologetic suicide note.","Access to CAMHS. Sofia was rejected for referral in April 2015. Might a lower threshold and earlier proactive interventionist policy have been of positive benefits to Sofia. Availability of CBT. Sofia was placed on a six month waiting list for CBT. This delay appears considerable. Sofia's care co-ordinator at CAMHS did not obtain the urgent input of a psychiatrist in accordance with NICE guidance. The recollections of Sofia's care co-ordinator and Sofia's mother as to the meeting of the nineteenth September were at odds with each other. Sofia's care co-ordinator recollected in her evidence telling Sofia's mother that Sofia was not to be left alone. Sofia's mother deemed the impression from Sofia's care co-ordinator's evidence was of Sofia being in an extremely vulnerable and dangerous position but this was not reflected in Sofia's care plan which made no mention of her not being left alone and it was not reflected in the care co-ordinator's actions in not urgently contacting Sofia's school, where she would be during the following days, to a psychiatrist. Her care plan appears to be the critical written record of the outcomes of this meeting as it was not of sufficient detail to safeguard Sofia. Language used in the SIRI report was felt to be inappropriate. The SIRI report effectively said if the care plan had been followed the outcome might have been different and that no change in clinical practice would have resulted in any different outcome. I do not believe either of these statements were true.","""Sofia was aged 14 years when she died""; ""The conclusion of the inquest was suicide""; ""Sofia deliberately suspended herself by the neck with the intention of ending her life"""

His mother went to his mental health appointments alone without her son and the majority of the contact with either her or Brandon was by telephone. At times she managed to get him into the car but when they arrived at the appointment he absolutely refused to get out of the car in order to see the clinician due to his anxieties. Appointments were made appropriately by health care staff but contact with him by health professionals was via occasional telephone calls, when he agreed to speak to them. The last face to face contact with any member of the health care team was on the thirty first May two thousand and sixteen and his suicide occurred on the ninth August two thousand and sixteen. It was established that the efficacy of his care was compromised because of this lack of contact but Brandon was simply too anxious to attend out patients appointments and there was no provision or funding for the clinicians to go to Brandon's home to treat him.",That there is no provision of mental health care for children in Leicestershire who due to their anxiety are unable to attend hospital for treatment.

There was no protocol for this. If they had sought a collateral history from the social worker, they would have discovered that Fallon’s mum was not dead as Fallon had told them, but was alive and living in a hostel. The social worker had been rung by a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, but she was waiting to be invited to a ward round at Mile End Hospital and such invitation was never made. It seems unlikely that proper discussion with the social worker would have changed the outcome for Fallon, but it would have meant that valuable information would have been shared, and it would have meant that Fallon would have had the benefit of her social worker on hand upon discharge.

Schofield,West Sussex,Amanda Spielman Chief Executive Ofsted,On 5 July 2017 I concluded the inquest into the death of Steffan Bonnot born 6 November 1988 aged 17 who died on 1 January 2016. His inquest was originally opened on 12 January 2016. The conclusion that I reached at the inquest was that Steffan committed suicide. At the time of his death he was in the care of Brighton and Hove Local Authority.,"Steffan was a young man who had spent a considerable amount of time in foster care and children's homes. He was due to move out of the Amicus Community Children's home and into another foster placement on sixteenth January two thousand and sixteen. It was clear from the evidence that he was concerned about leaving the Amicus Community and that he was anxious about whether or not the foster carers were fully appraised of his background. He had had a large number of foster placements in the past many of which had broken down. The concerns he had about how much the foster carers knew caused him some anxiety. On Friday first January two thousand and sixteen Steffan was amongst a small group of children who attended the local cinema. This was a pre-arranged outing. On the return from the cinema Steffan's group, which consisted of two staff and another child, stopped off at MacDonalds. Shortly after arriving at MacDonalds Steffan and the other young man went to the toilet. A member of staff followed them shortly afterwards and asked them to come out. Steffan did so but then left MacDonalds without saying anything. The staff tried to follow him and locate him. They were unable to do so and sadly Steffan's body was later found at the Warningcamp foot crossing having been struck by a train. Steffan had deliberately knelt down in front of an oncoming train.","The author of the serious case review reported that the prospective foster carers who were to offer a placement to Steffan had advised that they had not been made fully aware of all the background to Steffan's case. This was, however, at odds with what Steffan's social worker told us. However there was no formal documentation detailing exactly what had been disclosed. It was not therefore possible to be clear what information the prospective foster carer had been given. As we know the failing to provide foster carers with all the background information was one of Steffan's major concerns and added to his level of anxiety about his move. The above concern would apply equally to any individuals entrusted with the care of a child. All relevant information should be made available and it should be documented as to what has been provided so that the carers can make an informed decision before any placement is agreed. The young person could then be confident as to what the prospective carer's knew.","""aged 17""; ""Steffan committed suicide""; ""Steffan had deliberately knelt down in front of an oncoming train"""

Bedford,Berkshire,The Director of Primary Care; Woodley Centre Surgery,I conducted an inquest into the death of Mr George Arthur Cheese that was heard at Reading Town Hall between the 23rd and 25th May 2017 inclusive. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Cheese took his own life whilst suffering from a depressive disorder brought on by a series of life events. A full copy of the narrative conclusion is attached.,Mr Cheese was an 18 year old young man who was found hanging in woodland near his home address on 9 April 2015. He had a number of ongoing issues in his life including the potential loss of a career in the army; a fluctuating relationship with his girlfriend; an unsubstantiated concern that he might have a serious illness and he had been subject to upsetting treatment by his colleagues at work. He was under the care of his GP surgery and the local mental health team who were treating him for anxiety and depression including prescribing anti-depressant medication.,"(1) While the evidence at the inquest dealt with the various matters ongoing in Mr Cheese’s life, I also heard evidence of the care and treatment that he received from his GP surgery. One of the doctors at the surgery gave live evidence at the inquest.

(2) Mr Cheese was prescribed fluoxetine anti-depressant medication on the 3rd November 2014 by a treating GP, following admitting to fleeting suicidal thoughts. He was reviewed on 14th January 2015 when Mr Cheese described daily episodes of intense low mood with suicidal thoughts which included taking an overdose. This led to a reference to the mental health team. At an appointment with the practice’s nurse practitioner on 3rd February, Mr Cheese was prescribed 112 tablets of fluoxetine. In the course of her evidence, it was stated that the nurse practitioner was probably just repeating the same prescription that the previous doctor had issued to Mr Cheese but that she would not have done that.

(3) It was also acknowledged, in the course of her evidence, that there was no flag on Mr Cheese’s notes to alert treating clinicians within the GP practise to limit the amount of medication provided to Mr Cheese in view of his history. She acknowledged that a flag, in such circumstances, was good practise.

(4) The concerns arising from the evidence are therefore the amount of medication prescribed to a patient who was known to be suffering from mental health issues and describing suicidal thoughts and a potential overdose and the fact that this was not being flagged to prevent large amounts of medication being provided to him as a matter of repeat prescription.","""Mr Cheese was an 18 year old young man""; ""Mr Cheese took his own life""; ""found hanging"""

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 March 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide and the cause of death 1a asphyxia 1b external airways obstruction.,The deceased had been anxious and suffering from low self-esteem for some time. She was concerned about her weight. There had been some recent family relationship difficulties and she experienced peer pressure at school relating to a stormy relationship that she had with her boyfriend. She had been referred to child and adult mental health services (CAMHS) in November 2015 by her GP but that referral was not accepted. She was referred again by her school on the 20th October 2016. The following day she had contact with the CAMHS team who offered her an appointment which she declined because of difficulty accessing the venue. On the 4th November 2016 the CAMHS team attempted unsuccessfully to contact the school referrer. On the same day her family perceived that she returned home from school unhappy. At about 1700 hours she went to her bedroom at her home address saying she had a migraine. At 1710 hours she received a text from her boyfriend saying he wished to end their relationship. At 1713 hours they spoke on the phone and she indicated to him that she was going to kill herself. At about 2200 hours her father went to her bedroom and found her on the bedroom floor with a plastic bag over her head tied underneath her chin. She was certified dead at the scene.,At the inquest it was evident that Annabel had been referred by her GP to your team in November 2015 but that referral had not been accepted. She was referred again on 20 October 2016 by her school. This time the referral was accepted and your team made contact with her by telephone on 21 October 2016. She declined an appointment because she felt she could not get to the venue. No level of risk was recorded and next of kin details were not available. The date of appointment offered and declined were not recorded. Alternative time for appointment was not recorded. No follow up arrangements were recorded. There was no attempt to contact Annabel thereafter. An unsuccessful attempt to contact the referrer was made on 4 November 2016 the day Annabel took her own life. The time period between referral and initial contact and attempted follow up appears considerable. No attempt appears to have been made to engage with her parents who would have been in a position to assist with transport arrangements. The expectation that young people such as Annabel would 'opt in' to the system may be unrealistic given the difficulties that she had in engaging.

Rachal had not been attending school for a long period of time. She was being investigated for epilepsy and it was reported by her family that she was having seizures on a daily basis. These were not confirmed on any of the investigations undertaken.

By 2014 there were concerns by professionals as to both the underlying cause of any medical condition but also her lack of schooling, her lack of interaction and underlying stressors which may have been impacting on any medical condition.

There was also some evidence that she had attempted to self harm but this was denied by her family. The court heard that by March 2015 they were concerned that there was no counsellor involved with Rachal. By this stage it was accepted by Rachal's consultant that there should have been a referral to Child Adolescent Mental Health Services. The court also heard that there was some confusion as to whether a direct referral could be made to the Clinical Psychology Services.

A CAF process had been commenced because of concerns about Rachal but there was a complete lack of progression for this process until the involvement of the Early Help Services. A meeting did take place on the seventeenth June 2015 but having heard the evidence the court found that at best from March 2015 there was a fractured, disjointed plan as to how to proceed with Rachal's care.

By the time of Rachal's death there was a complete lack of action in respect of the plan for Rachal. Those involved with her medical care wanted input from mental health services to whom no referral had been made. Those involved with her social matters had wanted an outcome on her medical conditions.","GP services

There was a failure to undertake annual liver function tests in 2014 and 2015. The CAF documentation was completely overlooked and simply placed in the medical records as read only which led to no GP involvement in the inter-agency framework and handling of this case.

Tameside NHS FT and Pennine Care NHS FT

There was a lack of understanding between medical professionals as to the means by which someone could be referred to psychological services and whether there was an unclear message from psychological services as to whether they were accepting referrals. Lack of understanding amongst medical professionals as to the cases which may or may not be suitable for referral to CAMHS. There was a significant delay in the reporting of Rachals EEG and the Court heard that this remained the case in respect of reporting of EEGs at the time of the inquest.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 September 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was that Christopher died from asphyxia due to acute upper airway obstruction. The circumstances in which he came by his death were recorded by the jury in a narrative form, as follows: Christopher suffered from mental illness and was a patient at Bethlem Adolescent Unit at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, Beckenham. He had a history of hearing voices, suicidal ideas, and self harm, usually by swallowing objects. On 31 August 2014 at about 8 pm, Christopher went to the communal toilet on the unit and obstructed his airway by swallowing the lid of a roll on deodorant wrapped in tissue paper. He called for help but suffered a cardiac arrest before the obstruction could be removed, and could not be resuscitated. Christopher's actions were in part because of cumulative and continuing failures in risk assessment and management. His death was contributed to by neglect.",,In respect of the in-patient management that there was no separate policy or guidance other than a pictorial wall chart regarding the assessment and management of risks posed by items that might be used to cause self harm. The complexities of managing these risks on an adolescent in-patient psychiatric unit were not therefore adequately considered and this led to a lack of clarity and consistency. With regard to resuscitation the emergency equipment on the unit did not include a laryngoscope. The item obstructing Christopher's airway was subsequently used by ambulance personnel using Magill forceps with a laryngoscope and this combination had been successfully used on a previous occasion when Christopher had swallowed a bottle top. Laryngoscopes are not part of the standardised items on the unit and are not included in the Resuscitation Council guidance for mental healthcare settings. It has been suggested that this is because they are complex devices that require intense training and competency assessments before staff can use them and that it may be counterproductive to make them available. However in view of the circumstances of Christopher's death and the apparent prevalence of self harm in adolescent units the matter is reported for consideration both in relation to the laryngoscope itself and the access to staff trained in its use.,"""Christopher Brennan, age 15""; ""Christopher had a history of hearing voices, suicidal ideas, and self harm""; ""Christopher went to the communal toilet on the unit and obstructed his airway by swallowing the lid of a roll on deodorant wrapped in tissue paper""; ""He called for help but suffered a cardiac arrest before the obstruction could be removed, and could not be resuscitated"""

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4th November 2016 with the following narrative conclusion On the 4th April 2015 Joshua Harry Smith aged 16 years attended a party at a friend’s house Joshua drank some alcohol but was not drunk. He seemed fine when Joshua’s father collected him arriving home at 00 30 a.m. on the 5th April 2015. At 02 15 a.m. Joshua contacted ambulance control by 999 call asking for an ambulance. He was below the cliffs near the southernmost part of Spittal Beach Northumberland having fallen. Joshua had intended to jump from the cliff then changed his mind slipped and fell down the cliff to the bottom. Earlier text and Facebook messages showed that Joshua was thinking of taking his own life. After a prolonged search Joshua was eventually found clinging to a rock in the water at the base of the cliff at 04 01 a.m. There had been significant delays because Joshua’s first call to ambulance control advising his location as Spittal was not heard until it was later played back and while ambulance police fire and other agencies tried to locate Joshua. There was no indication that JESIP principles Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Program were followed regarding briefings or co-ordination of resources and the Berwick ambulance crew felt that there was no search co-ordinator or person taking overall control. Other agencies did not feedback what resources they had committed to the incident. When Joshua was eventually located at 04 01 a.m. he lost his grip while holding onto a rock and he was taken away from the shore by movement of the waves. An RAF Sea King helicopter by that time arrived and Joshua was winched out of the sea unconscious and conveyed to Wansbeck General Hospital. Sadly Joshua’s death was confirmed at 06 15 a.m. at Wansbeck General Hospital.,As described in the above narrative.,"At 2.15 a.m. when Joshua made his 999 call he stated to Ambulance control that he had fallen from a cliff near Spittal Beach which is on the south side of the River Tweed and injured himself, that he was alone and was unable to walk. Police and other emergency services were not immediately alerted from the outset of the information provided in Joshua’s telephone call to 999. Joshua’s location could not be identified from the mobile phone call made to 999. Two Police Officers on Berwick Town Centre duties which is north of the River Tweed were asked in the street by paramedics for assistance in locating Joshua, and while paramedics went to look for Joshua on the north side of Berwick near the Holiday Park and cliffs, the police officers travelled to Spittal looking for Joshua although they had no name or further details at that time. A brief search of Spittal beach near to the cliffs by Police Officers was unsuccessful before they returned to Town Centre duties. A report to Police Control was not made at that time. The search for Joshua was briefly stood down after a North East Ambulance call to Joshua’s father indicated that Joshua was at home in his bedroom without waiting for [REDACTED] to check and confirm whether Joshua was in fact in his bedroom. The search for Joshua continued at Berwick Holiday Park on the north side of the River Tweed and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed as a result of his location at Spittal Beach not being recognised from his 999 call. After Joshua’s phone call was listened back it was observed that he had described his location as Spittal at the bottom of a cliff near Spittal beach. Joshua had explained in his 999 call that he was below cliffs having fallen was injured and that an ambulance would not be able to reach him. The Hazardous Area Response Team of North East Ambulance was not deployed to the incident until approximately 3 a.m. arriving at the scene under an hour later and were 1.5 miles away from the incident at the time Joshua was swept out to sea by action of the waves. The circumstances of the incident showed that although there were examples of good co-operation and effort among the emergency services overall command control and co-ordination were unclear and JESIP was not followed.","""Joshua Harry Smith aged 16 years""; ""Joshua was thinking of taking his own life""; ""Joshua’s death was confirmed at 06 15 a.m. at Wansbeck General Hospital"""

The jury determined that Amy had died from the complications arising from hypoxic ischaemic brain damage following the tying of a ligature around her neck. The jury returned a narrative questionnaire in which they found that Amy's death had been contributed to by neglect and they also found that there were a number of causative failures which led to her death. A copy of the narrative questionnaire is attached.","Amy El Keria was aged 14 years old at the material time. She had a range of complex needs associated with a number of mental health diagnoses. Up until the time of her hospital admission she lived with her mother and sister in Hounslow. Following her exclusion from school in early 2012 her mental health deteriorated and she started to ligature. In August 2012 she was seen for an emergency outpatient assessment and a planned inpatient admission was sought. However there were no specialist Child and Adolescent high dependency beds available immediately and Amy had to be admitted to the Priory Hospital at Roehampton. The following day she transferred to the Ticehurst House Hospital which is part of the Priory Group. During her stay at Ticehurst Amy's mental health fluctuated and at times she had to be forcefully restrained and sedated.

On twelfth November 2012, having told staff earlier in the day that she wanted to kill herself, she tied a ligature, namely a football scarf, around her neck and suspended herself from a radiator in her room. She subsequently died from her injuries the following day.",The evidence given at the inquest showed that there was a clear misapprehension by Hounslow Social Services as to their role in supporting Amy whilst at Ticehurst. It appears that Social Services did not appreciate their important ongoing role to ensure Amy's welfare whilst placed at Ticehurst. The Court expert gave evidence that Hounslow may have seen this health funded placement as a stand-alone intervention that did not require their input. Social Services clearly have a vital role to play in ensuring family contact where a child is placed far from their family home where difficulties arise. There was no assessment carried out to assess whether there was any need to provide support to a child in need under Section 17 Children Act 1989 even when Amy's mother had specifically raised the difficulties she was having with contact with Amy including the cost of travel with her support worker. The family gave evidence to the extent that having better contact with Amy and more input into her care may have brought about a different outcome particularly when she was distressed.,"""Amy Rose El-Keria born 14 May 1998 aged 14 years""; ""she tied a ligature, namely a football scarf, around her neck and suspended herself""; ""she subsequently died from her injuries the following day"""

No. Are there any other factors or circumstances outside the prison you feel to be relevant? Answer. Lack of family contact, bad relationship with his father in England, Liam's trouble with a restraining order with his girlfriend and the lack of contact with his family in Australia. Was there a delay in identifying the discovery of Liam on evening of 19th March 2015 as requiring a code blue emergency medical response? Answer. Yes. If so, did that delay possibly contribute to the outcome? Answer. Yes. Was there a delay by prison staff in assisting paramedics to reach Liam's cell on that night? Answer. Yes. If so, did the delay possibly contribute to the outcome? Answer. Yes.","Liam arrived in Glen Parva Young Offenders Institution at the beginning of February 2015. His anticipated release date was 1 April 2015. On 12 March he caused minor deliberate self harm and an ACCT document was opened, noting that the reason for his self-harm was due to bullying on the wing. He was identified as being socially isolated as his family were living in Australia. He had no visits and made no telephone calls an official visitor was planned but did not see him before he died.

2727,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/thomas-gallagher/,,2016-08-11,L. Hashmi,Greater Manchester North,Chief Constable for Greater Manchester Police,On 25 July 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Martin Gallagher,"Tom was aged 16 years at the time of his death. He had been diagnosed as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and psychosis by a child psychiatrist. In the months before his death he received care and treatment as a voluntary inpatient at a specialist adolescent mental health unit, whilst within the community he received care and support from the child and adolescent mental health team (CAMHS). He had a history of self-harm/attempted suicide, including an attempt at self-ligature. On the 10th July 2015 Tom had been working during the day and appeared relatively settled although he struggled to control the effects of his OCD. In the late afternoon/early evening, he became agitated and therefore decided to walk the dog in order to relieve the tension. He dropped the dog back home at around 19:30 but went straight out again. When he did not return home, his family tried to contact him on his mobile by calls and text messaging. Tom failed to respond. This was unusual. By 21:00 his family was becoming increasingly concerned and therefore carried out a search of the local area. At 02:44 on the 11th July 2015, Tom's father contacted Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to report that his son was missing. The call taker created a Force Wide Incident Note (FWIN), completed the '1-12' and coded the call as requiring a Grade 2 response which meant that the call required priority attendance, allocating by the radio operator within 20 minutes and attendance by a police officer within 1 hour from the creation of the Incident Log. Tom was correctly identified as a missing person. From this point on, the FWIN was delayed on no less than 14 occasions; the family's call therefore remained unallocated. Almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without rationale. No service call was made to Tom's family and as no officer was allocated, the 'Golden Hour' was missed. The Incident Response Protocol - in particular the Grade 2 FWIN Escalation Process - was not followed, the cross-border process was not instigated and neither 'Silver Command' nor the OCB supervisor were made aware of the problems that were being encountered in allocating resources to FWIN. On the night in question, GMP was experiencing what was described as an 'unprecedented/unpredictable spike' in Grade 1-3 calls. There was also an ongoing policing operation within the town centre and staffing levels were low. The deployable resources available to the duty Inspector were approximately 50 per cent lower than those 'on paper'. Staffing levels had been persistently lower than expected in the weeks before Tom's death. The low staffing levels of the 10-11 July 2015 were recognised in good time and were brought to the attention of the DRMU and the senior leadership team (SLT) on Monday 6th July at a routine meeting. However whilst it was agreed that additional resources would be allocated to support the Friday/Saturday shift a Chief Inspector subsequently declined to allocate/authorise this as he felt that the levels were 'within tolerance'. This change of decision was not conveyed to the duty sergeant who had been present at the Monday meeting and/or divisional duty Inspector. At around 08:00 Tom's father made a further call to GMP as he had not heard anything. In the meantime, [REDACTED] resumed the search for her son. At 08:07, Tom was discovered by a member of the public suspended by ligature from a tree in the park close to his home. A 999 call was made and police attended immediately. The fact of Tom's death was confirmed by paramedics at shortly before 08:30. Tom's mother heard of her son's death from a member of the public whilst trying to elicit information from an officer at the scene. Following post mortem examination the medical cause of death was given as asphyxia, fatal pressure on the neck and hanging. At inquest GMP admitted shortcomings in the way that it responded to the family's call for help. The jury concluded suicide and added the following: Tom's mental health issues, alteration in frequency of appointments with medical services due to transitional care, the FWIN not being switched to supervisor after 20 minutes, lack of contact within the initial hour to the family, lack of justification for the delays on the FWIN. It could not be concluded that the admitted shortcomings caused or contributed to the deceased's death. The jury also found that Tom died before 02:44 on the 11th July 2015.","The lack of formal training in relation to risk assessment and child mental health. Save for the initial call handler, that all staff demonstrated intentional disregard of Force policies and protocols including those with operational management responsibilities and the Operational Communications Branch OCB. That the Force has no set minimum staffing levels including within divisional response and the OCB. That when the persistently low staffing levels were brought to the attention of GMPs' SLT on more than one occasion insufficient action was taken so as to ensure that the number of officers on duty matched those identified as being required on paper. That when decisions were taken not to allocate additional cover resources no rationale was recorded no minutes were kept in relation to the decisions taken during the Monday meeting no contemporaneous record was made by the Chief Inspector regarding his decision to reverse the earlier agreement to allocate additional resources and the Chief Inspector did not communicate his decision to those who needed to know. Despite hearing evidence on the positive steps taken by GMP since Tom's death there was no solid evidence of resource commitment to prevent recurrence. That there were 14 delays placed on FWIN 0405. That almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without written rationale. That FWIN 0405 went unallocated despite some evidence of attempts to resource resulting in the very important Golden Hour being missed. That no service call was made to Tom's family to reassure them that they had not been forgotten.","""Tom was aged 16 years at the time of his death""; ""The jury concluded suicide"""

She underwent a heart transplant in April 2010. Post procedure she recovered well from a cardiac perspective. However, she developed complicated neuro-psychological problems arising from the brain injury caused by the stroke. Anielka's home life was difficult, and she was often reluctant to engage with professionals. She engaged in risk taking behaviours, which included on occasion self-harming, alcohol, illicit drug use, and becoming involved in inappropriate relationships. In December 2014, Anielka was taken off a child protection plan which had been in place since 2011. Her care was being transitioned from child and young person's services to adult services. Multiple agencies were involved with Anielka's care, and her complex needs were identified. However, no lead professional was identified to coordinate her care. On more than one occasion the agencies did not communicate with each other. This led to missed opportunities to provide a structured care plan for Anielka. In January 2015, Anielka drew on her bedroom walls a number of images which indicated suicidal intent. Local mental health services were not made aware of this. On the 4th of February 2015, she attended her final appointment at the children's transplant clinic. She travelled to Great Ormond Street with her father. Her journey was delayed by a fatality occurring on the railway line. She was also very upset after reading a report that referred to her ongoing need for support and services. The following day on the 5th of February 2015, she left her father in Gloucester City centre at approximately 1000 hours. She made her way to her training college. She then departed for home. Her father returned home at about 1500 hours and found Anielka hanging by the neck from the bannister. A dressing gown cord had been used as the ligature. Her father cut her down and dialled emergency services. Paramedics arrived shortly thereafter and pronounced Anielka deceased at 1510 hours. Police are satisfied there are no suspicious circumstances. A suicide note was found at scene.","When an individual is being cared for by numerous agencies, in particular when said individual is a child transitioning to adult services, there is no lead key professional identified, which can result in a breakdown of communication between the agencies.","""This 17 year old young lady Anielka""; ""The conclusion of the inquest was a short form suicide""; ""found Anielka hanging by the neck""; ""A suicide note was found at scene"""

She had attempted suicide on a number of occasions in the past. She suffered a significant relapse in her mental health around August 2015 and had intensive input from the Mental Health Team being dealt with and or contacted on an almost daily basis. On the 31st October 2015 she was detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act after it became clear that the input that she was having was not working and there were real concerns for her mental health and her risk of self harm/suicide. As no acute beds were available for her within the Powys area or indeed any surrounding area she was taken in the early hours of the morning to Bristol Priory Hospital where she remained until the Section was lifted on the 16th November. In the intervening period she had become physically unwell and was moved to another hospital for main stream medical care. Upon discharge home she remained under the care of the local community Mental Health Team (Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team) until her death on the 3rd January 2016. On that day concern was raised by her daughter who was unable to contact her and when police forced entry at her home address she was discovered hanging from a ligature on a bedroom door at her address.",There is no acute facility in Powys for the treatment of acutely unwell patients which the evidence showed often leads to patients being moved the length and breadth of the country to an establishment where a bed can be found The evidence also showed that the local acute unit at the Redwood Centre in Shrewsbury had recently experienced a significant reduction in the number of acute beds available compounding and exacerbating the problem As a consequence of 1 above there is often a lack of continuity of treatment which can be to the detriment of the patient concerned The evidence showed that on balance it is likely that the experience of being sectioned in these circumstances had an adverse effect upon Mrs Taylor which fuelled an unwillingness on her part to engage with mental health professionals thereby increasing her risk of self harm suicide It is believed that Powys Health Board is the only Health Board in the country that has no facility available to it for the treatment of acute admission patients in the position of Mrs Taylor,"""attempting her first suicide, the evidence showed, at the age of 16""; ""The conclusion of the inquest was 'Suicide'""; ""death on the 3rd January 2016"""

Harris,London Inner South,"Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Ministry of Justice; Mr Will Tuckley, Chief Executive, London Borough of Tower Hamlets; Director of Fitness to Practice Directorate, General Medical Council",An inquest hearing at Southwark Coroner's Court touching the death of Imran Douglas who died on 13 November 2013 in HM Prison Belmarsh was concluded before a jury on 3 November 2015 The jury's conclusion as to the death was suicide,"The circumstances that the jury recorded are complex and lengthy, despite the direction to be brief, reflecting multiple contributing factors to the death. They are laid out in an attached Record of Inquest, to enable the Ministry of Justice to understand the systemic failings throughout his detention, especially in the light of the Harris Review. Four particular significant contributory factors are relevant to this report: a lack of transition planning; systemic lack of communication between and within almost all agencies; the problem of overlapping databases, not all accessible to every agency; problems in handling the deceased at HMP Belmarsh.

In summary of the circumstances, Mr Douglas suffered from brain injury after a car accident aged 16. He suffered impulsivity, mood swings, and suicidal ideation afterwards. He was arrested and charged with murder aged 17, and entered custody in a special training centre, where his Youth Offending Team (YOT) worker recorded risk of suicide and a previous attempt. He was closely monitored and means of self harm removed and this was documented in a Suicide and Self Harm Form (SASH).

The YOT recorded in a Placement Form on 29th May 2013 that Mr Douglas would kill himself, using his clothes for suspension, if he is given a long sentence, and this was included in subsequent Placement Forms available on the E Asset System. He was admitted under s48/49 MHA for psychiatric assessment, but the psychiatrist had no recollection of seeing the SASH form, recorded no significant deliberate self harm and concluded he was of low suicide risk and not mentally ill, but vulnerable and impulsive on discharge. He was to be transferred to Feltham A YOI on 17th September. It appeared that neither Feltham staff, nor the YOT attended the CPA meeting, nor was his mother invited, so that the records did not represent the YOT worker's concerns about his risks nor his past suicidal behaviour. Feltham records never included the SASH, nor the YOT worker's concerns, and there was a dispute as to what discussions did take place between the YOT worker and a lead prison officer. Risk assessments and placement forms including suicidal behaviour and his medium risk of self harm were available to Feltham staff on the E Asset system. The prison officer agreed that had she seen them, an ACCT would have been opened. Despite a recommendation that he should have mental health supervision, and not knowing the past history, a nurse at Feltham discharged him from the mental health team.

There was a failure of transition planning, with social workers not being invited to a transition meeting and the Head of Young People failing to contact the Youth Justice Board (YJB), Population Management Unit (PMU), nor Feltham B, despite his approaching his 18th birthday on 11th October. He attended court on 7th October, where he changed his plea to guilty and was observed to have a change of mood. On 7th October, YJB sent three Service Placement Confirmations to YOT, Feltham and escort staff, which indicated then that he was a suicide risk and he returned to Feltham A. His offender supervisor did not see him between plea and sentence and there was no apparent consideration of the impact of his change of plea to guilty. The YOT worker thought a transition plan had been made, in line with his wishes, for him to transfer to Feltham B, when he appeared in court for sentencing on 8th November 2013 and that the YJB would organise this. A YJB spokesperson explained that she had no power to do this, as it was outside the young offenders estate and Mr Douglas was no longer a young offender. The Feltham Governor thought the plan was for him to return to A and later transfer to B, but this was not written down anywhere. In the event, the deceased was sent to court on 8th November, with all his belongings, with no indication of suicide risk nor endorsement on his prison escort record that he was to return, which the jury concluded meant he was not to return to Feltham A. He received an 18 year sentence, which was much longer than he anticipated and the YOT and escort staff were concerned about the effect of the sentence on him. His behaviour change led to an escort officer opening a suicide and deliberate self harm warning form. A YJB spokesperson advised that Feltham A had no authority to accept an adult, although on the phone to escort staff, they had agreed to have him back, they declined when the PMU rang. The court heard that Feltham A had 40 vacancies, but Feltham B was full, and the PMU allocated him to go to Belmarsh. The deputy director of Public Sector Prisons expressed surprise at this decision; the YOT worker agreed it was not a suitable placement. The jury recorded that there was no hotline between YJB and PMU for urgent borderline cases, nor a protocol to specifically speak to the YOI governor.

In Belmarsh two officers and a nurse saw him in rapid succession, registering no concerns about his state of mind or age, with a nurse disregarding the court staff suicide warning form. No discipline staff, nor health care staff considered he needed an ACCT opening, although the duty governor considered it should have been, on the basis of his sentence and age alone. Had the warning form been seen by the First Night Centre, it was widely agreed that an ACCT would have been opened, but it never was.

He received a medical assessment by a doctor who did see the court suicide warning form, but thought there was no risk of self harm, no need for observation nor referral, with no documentary evidence of history or examination and whose only records entry was ""feels ok"". Another nurse relied heavily on the prisoner's denial of suicidal intent. The jury noted that staff in Belmarsh did not have access to the E Asset system in YOIs. On the next day he was seen by a nurse whose secondary assessment was perfunctory and conducted without consultation with his electronic medical records. He was classed as a vulnerable prisoner due to high media interest, but officers were not initially aware of this and he was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day before his suicide on the fifth day in HMP Belmarsh.","The system of placements at transition

The YOT worker said that it was a problem having a sudden change of duties aged 18 and it would be better if legal duties were kept in parallel with their work until the Transition Plan was completed. The Head of Placements and Safeguarding at YJB was taken to an extract of the YOT worker's reflections on the operation of the transition system, in which she said that historically there was an approach that when you are 18, our role just stops that did not occur here. The famous civil servant said that officials are the servants of the public and the official must not try to foster the illusion it is the other way round. She was asked whether Imran Douglas had to fit into the system rather than the system serve him. She agreed that a more flexible policy was needed. She agreed that the Transition Process was bureaucratic, and to work, it depended on good will. She agreed that there was an inherent risk from the statutory change of duties at 18, especially when staff were under pressure, but was concerned if legislative change adds to bureaucracy. The Deputy Director of NOMS agreed that it made no sense that there was a legal hand over of roles at 18 years it would be better if handover of responsibility took place when the Transition Plan was completed.

I consider that there is an outstanding risk that, when a rising 18 enters the criminal justice system with insufficient time for the normal Transition Plan, and especially when staff are under pressure, that even with the changes in placements from courts that have been made, and the Joint National Protocol, the knowledge and expertise of the YOT and YJB may not be properly considered in a placement if the legal duty for placement has passed to the PMU before the Plan is complete. The Secretary of State is asked to consider whether a person based rather than rule based system would be safer, by legislating to allow flexibility for YJB and YOTs to decide when the duty for placement is passed to the PMU, in line with the completion of the person's Transition Plan, rather than rigidly on the 18th birthday.

The adequacy of knowledge and interagency working between social care in London Borough of Tower Hamlets and the secure estate

Evidence pointed to a disconnection between Looked After Child pathway planning and Transition Planning. A social worker said that the LAC plan was potentially informative but did not matter if it was not completed, but that now it is regarded as key and should be shared. One social worker said she did not know what a Transition Plan was. The current Head of Children's Social Care at LB Tower Hamlets said that staff pressures at the time had eased somewhat, but that under her leadership the interface with the secure estate was through the YJB and so social workers do not directly talk to the secure estate staff. This was despite the requirement for the two to work together in the Youth to Adult Transitions Framework. Given the lack of documented communications of risks and concerns between YOT and Feltham in 2013, this evidence throws doubt on the reported improvements in training and changes in interagency communication have been put into operation since.

The adequacy of electronic communication systems between agencies

The jury criticised the lack of access of HMP Belmarsh to the E Asset system and the fact that key documents from the Secure Training Centre were never accessed by the secure estate. The lack of a universal system of records throughout the offender's pathway results in information on risk not being known to others and may contribute to future deaths.

The competence of a medical practitioner, who no longer is employed in health care in HMP Belmarsh, but is on the GMC register and may practise elsewhere and as a general practitioner

The GP did not record history or examination or propose any interventions despite being aware of the young age, long sentence and suicide warning from court. The clinical review conducted as part of the Prison and Probation Ombudsman's Report concluded that health care provision in HMP Belmarsh was below the standard expected.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 6th February 2015.,"The deceased had always resided with her family in the Lancashire area. There had been increasing concern about her behaviour including her drug use, her abusive and aggressive outbursts, self-harming and her mental health. She had spent a month in July two thousand and thirteen in the Platform facility in Preston, Lancashire. This is a mental health facility for young people. Upon her discharge matters deteriorated and on the twenty-fifth of October Kesia was arrested by Lancashire Police. Her behaviour whilst in custody was concerning but she was not deemed to require sectioning under the Mental Health Act. Following her release from custody on the twenty-sixth of October she threatened to jump from a bridge. The same day she went to live with her father in the Tameside area of Manchester. Kesia had had little contact with her father and he was not aware of all the recent issues and concerns surrounding Kesia. From this point onwards Kesia had little contact with her mother and step-father who understandably had been severely impacted by the difficulties they had faced with Kesia. Due to concerns about her behaviour whilst she was in police custody in Lancashire, Lancashire Constabulary raised a safeguarding report to the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub which led to a referral to Lancashire Children's Services. This referral indicated that Kesia was a high risk and likely to self-harm. Given that Kesia was now residing in the Tameside area the referral was then forwarded by Lancashire Children's Services to Tameside Children's Services. Upon receiving the referral only part of the information provided by Lancashire was then cut and pasted onto Tameside's own referral form which was inputted onto the computer system. There was therefore incomplete information on their own form although the Lancashire form was also scanned onto the Tameside computer system. When the case was reviewed not all of the information was considered as only the incomplete Tameside form was ever read. A decision was taken not to open a file and conduct a social work assessment for Kesia but to send a referral to the Child Adolescent and Mental Health Service. Upon receipt of this referral Pennine NHS Foundation Trust assessed the information provided by Tameside and sent the referral to the administrator of the service for an appointment to be sent to Kesia. No appointment had been sent to Kesia at the time of her death. As a result of her arrest in Lancashire, Kesia was before the Magistrates Court in Preston on the fifth of November two thousand and thirteen. She received a referral order. Lancashire Youth Offending Team attended court and noted Kesia's new address in Tameside. However the case, which was then considered by at least four people in the Lancashire Youth Offending Team, was not transferred over to the Tameside Youth Offending Team at all prior to Kesia's death. On four occasions there was a failure to notice the new address for Kesia which was clearly marked on the documentation on the file. This meant that the referral order assessment and panel process was not commenced and concluded within the national guidelines prior to her death. There was also inappropriate thought given to breaching Kesia for non-compliance of her referral order. From the twenty-sixth of October two thousand and thirteen whilst in the Manchester area Kesia, on at least eight occasions prior to her arrest on the thirtieth of November, had some interaction with officers from Greater Manchester Police. On one occasion she was reported as missing from home by her father; she was located the following day residing with her boyfriend at the Armadale Road address. On two occasions Kesia made calls to the police with allegations of domestic violence against her by her boyfriend. On another occasion she made a report of an assault against her by the ex-partner of her boyfriend. On the twenty-fifth of November Kesia attended at her mother's home in Lancashire where she was aggressive, threatened to push her grandmother down the stairs and had hold of a knife whilst threatening to self-harm. Officers from Lancashire Constabulary attended, Kesia was calm at the time of their arrival and she was taken back to her father's house by her grandmother. Her father was not provided with information as to the exact nature of what had occurred. Lancashire Constabulary made a further referral to their Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub which assessed Kesia as a medium risk. Following her move to the Manchester area the inquest heard evidence which indicated that from shortly after the twenty-sixth of October Kesia was not in fact residing at her father's. She was in reality spending a lot of time residing with her boyfriend and also staying in other accommodation. On the thirtieth of November Kesia was arrested in Manchester by Greater Manchester Police for criminal damage and possession of cannabis. Shortly after her arrest and before her arrival at the police station, Kesia's presentation changed and she was extremely abusive and aggressive. She remained in police custody, for reasons set out below, until the Monday morning when she was placed before the court. Her behaviour whilst in custody was of concern to custody staff and on two occasions police requested the attendance of medical professionals from MEDACS. Whilst in custody, at the time of the first medical assessment, Kesia made a threat to jump off a bridge if she was released from custody. This was documented on the risk assessment form on the custody record. A full risk assessment was not completed on her arrival into custody nor at any stage during her time in the police station. Following her initial assessment by MEDACS there was a reasonable assessment made that Kesia was intoxicated and a decision taken to allow her time to sleep and potentially sober up. The inquest heard evidence that the first nurse was not able to complete her assessment of Kesia at this stage. A second assessment by MEDACS was conducted sometime later. The inquest heard evidence about this assessment and also viewed the CCTV footage. The inquest found that this assessment was incomplete and fell well short of being a meaningful assessment. In addition the inquest heard evidence as to whether MEDACS should be able to access records held about an individual if they had been assessed by their staff in a different police force area. When assessed in Manchester by MEDACS access to her Lancashire MEDACS records would not have been possible as her name had been entered as unknown and not updated. During her interview and subsequent time in custody Kesia's behaviour remained concerning. A decision was taken not to bail Kesia but to keep her in custody in part due to the concerns officers had about her safety. The inquest heard evidence as to the legislation surrounding seventeen year olds in custody and additionally the availability of PACE beds for children in custody. Whilst in custody Kesia had access to an appropriate adult. The request for an appropriate adult was made by Greater Manchester Police to Tameside Social Services. A form was then sent to the volunteer who attended the police station. In Manchester the volunteer appropriate adult scheme is run by the Police and Crime Commissioner. The form completed by the appropriate adult should then be faxed back to Social Services. This did not happen. Information about the threat Kesia had made to jump off a bridge was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service by way of the MG7 but it was not noted on the Prisoner Escort Record. At court Kesia was seen by her solicitor, Tameside Youth Offending Team and GEO Amey staff before her appearance in court. At no stage did they become aware of the threat Kesia had made whilst in police custody as this was known only to the Crown Prosecution Service. No remand application was made therefore the Crown Prosecution Service did not place the information as to her threat before the court. Whilst being held at the Magistrates Court Kesia's behaviour caused concern. Bail checks on appropriate addresses were not carried out. Kesia was released with a bail condition of residence at her father's address. She left court and went to her boyfriend's address where she stayed the night. She was found later the next morning in the garden of the property having tied a ligature around her neck.","Legislation and the provision of local authority accommodation

The inquest heard evidence that recent changes to legislation means that whilst in custody 17 year olds are now treated as children for the purposes of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE). However the failure to make legislative changes to the supporting legislation means that for 17 year olds there is an anomaly in the system particularly around the provision of accommodation for a 17 year old who is refused bail. For these purposes a 17 year old is still classed as an adult and not a child and therefore there is no requirement for local authorities to provide accommodation. This would require primary legislation.

There remains no legal requirement for local authorities to provide accommodation for 17 year olds who will then have to remain in police custody if bail is refused. The result is that 17 year old children risk being kept in custody for longer than necessary if there is nowhere suitable for them to be bailed to.

In addition the inquest also heard evidence as to the reality of the situation in practice and the availability of such accommodation for those children to whom the law currently does apply i.e. 16 years and younger. The inquest heard that across Greater Manchester it is estimated that, until recently, in only 10 per cent of cases where the police requested such a service from a local authority a bed was available. Attempts are being made to address this issue but at present the figure remains at approximately 20 per cent and the inquest heard evidence that this was, ""not good enough"".

Again the facts heard at this inquest seem to suggest that children younger than 17 are at risk of being held in custody longer than necessary due to a lack of appropriate facilities. The court heard evidence that the police are in the undesirable position of having to decide whether to detain someone potentially unlawfully or release them when they feel it may be unsafe to do so.

It was clear throughout the inquest that the legislation relating to 17 year olds presented challenges to those professionals who had contact with Kesia. For the purposes of safeguarding and the Children's Act she remained a child, being someone under the age of 18. Equally, however, she was old enough to consent to be in a sexual relationship. The court was left with little doubt that the differing legislative provisions for 17 year olds pose unique challenges for professionals in dealing with people of this age.

Exit risk assessments

The court heard that since Kesias death Greater Manchester Police have implemented a system to try and ensure that this situation does not happen again. It was therefore decided to hold a joint medical and police exit risk assessment when someone who has displayed self-harm ideation or behaviour leaves custody.

Initially this was introduced for people aged 17 and under but as of January 2015 it was extended to all people leaving custody.

Whilst this has been a significant commitment from Greater Manchester Police and has required the funding for an additional doctor the court heard evidence that so far this risk assessment has been conducted on over 144 people leaving custody.

This is clearly capturing a large number of people who are displaying signs of similar behaviour or thoughts as Kesia did whilst in custody and the court heard that a joint medical and police risk assessment on their exit from custody is essential in trying to ensure appropriate support when they leave the police station.

Lancashire Youth Offending Team and Tameside Youth Offending Team

The court heard evidence as to the poor understanding and communication between the Youth Offending teams of Lancashire and Tameside following Kesias re-location to the Manchester area. There was a failure by Lancashire to note her move which led to a delay in her case being transferred, but in addition there was a failure in the communications with Tameside for each team to understand what was being requested and to have oversight of the situation. This led to a lack of involvement with Kesia and a proposal to breach her. It also meant that no effective work was being carried out with her and a missed opportunity to recognise her developing situation in terms of her lack of residence and drug use.

Greater Manchester Police

Safeguarding responsibilities

The inquest heard a great deal of evidence from officers as to their understanding and actions. No intelligence was placed on Kesias nominal profile despite a number of concerning contacts with her by officers. It is a core function of the police to submit such intelligence.

Greater Manchester Police has no stand-alone safeguarding policy for matters which are not criminal. There is no clear guidance to officers regarding what to do to raise safeguarding issues. There is no process for the recording of safeguarding concerns. There is confusion and a lack of understanding as to which agencies officers should refer to and where this should be recorded. The fact that there was no record of Greater Manchester Police's involvement with Kesia, despite her having been reported missing from home, information about drugs, self-harm and being in a relationship with a much older individual did not flag-up one safeguarding referral to another agency was concerning.

Force wide incident notices (FWINS)

There were a number of reported incidents relating to Kesia and her involvement with Greater Manchester police which necessitated the opening of a FWIN. The court heard evidence as to the failure to pass on complete information to the officers who then subsequently attended on Kesia including on one occasion the fact that it had been communicated that she had a knife. The court heard evidence that the failure to pass on important information could impact on the safety of the officers and others and also lead to missed opportunities for safeguarding.

Closing codes for domestic violence incidents

Evidence was heard that when a FWIN is closed a code is attached to it. For domestic violence incidents the closing code relates to people over the age of 16 as being adults. This means that the case is not then automatically passed through to the Child Protection Team within Greater Manchester Police for a review even if one of the people involved is still a child i.e. is 17 years of age.

Whilst the case would still be considered by the Public Protection Investigation Unit however the availability for the child protection unit to have all the information relating to children may be beneficial.

Checks carried out by Public Protection Investigation Unit

Evidence was given to the court that when a Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Harassment form (DASH) is submitted to the PPI unit, where the risk level is standard then no checks on the Police National Computer or the Police National Database are carried out. The rationale for this was not clear although DC Evans indicated this may be due to the volume of work. Clearly the PNC can hold vital information about a potential offender.

Custody handovers

The court heard evidence that the handovers which ensure that custody officers taking charge for detainees and their welfare have to conduct such handovers in their own time. The system at present relies on officers and staff attending work early and sometimes staying late after a 12 hour shift to provide a handover. Whilst it is clear there would need to be some overlap in the times people are on duty, the court heard evidence as to the quality of the handovers which is clearly impacted by the fact that this crucial part of the information sharing process relies entirely on the free-time of officers and staff.

The court was advised that the provision of custody within GMP is currently under review but at present the position remains as it was in 2013.

Completion of the Prisoner Escort Record

The Prisoner Escort Record form was completed over 12 hours prior to Kesia leaving police custody. It was not checked or amended prior to her release and it failed to contain crucial information indicating that whilst in custody Kesia had made a threat to jump from a bridge. This should have been included.

Greater Manchester Police and Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust

Tameside Diversion Project

The court heard evidence regarding a project in Tameside similar to one in Newcastle the aim of which was apparently to divert young people from the Criminal Justice System. However the court heard that the Tameside Youth Diversion Project is not working as intended. The plan being that once someone is arrested there should be consideration to diverting the young person away from the Criminal Justice System if there is evidence of emotional disturbance or self-harm etc. The court heard evidence that in Tameside this signposting is only taking place to the mental health services once the young person has been processed through the Criminal Justice System and is not in fact acting as a diversion pathway. There was no evidence from those working in custody that any consideration was given to this scheme for Kesia and there appeared to be little knowledge of the scheme. On the face of the evidence the current system appeared to duplicate the work carried out by the 16-19 Mental Health Service.

Greater Manchester Police / Police and Crime Commissioner and local authorities

Multi-agency Safeguarding Hubs

The court heard evidence as to the effective working in County Council and Lancashire Constabulary of the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH). It was clear from the evidence that the interactions Lancashire Constabulary officers had with Kesia led to a simple, effective means of passing on safeguarding information to the MASH. This was not the system in Manchester and the court heard evidence that the development of MASHs across Manchester is still ongoing. The court heard that in Manchester different hubs work differently with different agendas - some relate to domestic violence only and not all of them deal with safeguarding of children. The court was advised that the plan is that by the end of the year across Manchester there will be fully operational safeguarding hubs but that each different local authority wants to go about it in a different way. This will mean that there is a lack of consistency in approach across the different local authorities in Manchester as to what will be dealt with. Worryingly some will not deal with the safeguarding of children and such an approach may lead to a lack of consensus and understanding of their roles. In addition such an individual approach will need careful understanding by other agencies as to what can be referred and what cannot potentially exacerbating an already difficult and confusing situation.

All agencies

Having heard the evidence the court felt that there was a degree of confusion and misunderstanding between all the agencies as to their roles, what they are able and not able to do and also where to access important and effective information. By way of brief examples, when Kesia was in custody MEDACS contacted the Crisis Team to see if Kesia was known to them, Kesia had never been involved with the Crisis Team. There was no contact made with the Mental Health Services who did have information that she was waiting for an appointment or with the Youth Offending Team. Tameside Youth Offending Team did not have access to Tameside Children's Social Care records so did not realise that Kesia had been referred to them.","""Kesia Lena Mary Leatherbarrow aged 17 years""; ""she threatened to jump from a bridge""; ""she was found later the next morning in the garden of the property having tied a ligature around her neck"""

Leeming,Manchester West,"The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt, Minister for Health; The Rt Hon Nicky Morgan, Minister for Education; The Rt Hon Eric Pickles, Minister for Local Government","On 4 April 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin, aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 March 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had committed suicide. The medical cause of her death was 1a hanging.","On the 15th of July 2003 a Care Order relating to Aleysha McLoughlin was made at Manchester County Court upon the application of Bolton Council. Aleysha was then placed with a family member, where she remained settled until the 9th of September 2012 when she went to stay with her mother and refused to return. On the 8th of October Aleysha left her mother's address and although there was a short period thereafter when Aleysha returned to live with her family member the placement broke down. Accordingly on the 26th of November 2012 Aleysha was placed with a foster carer where she remained until her death in April 2014. As the foster carer lived in a different area Aleysha also changed schools, and at first she appeared to make a positive start at her new school. However from in or about March 2013 her schoolwork and behaviour began to deteriorate. Likewise Aleysha appeared to settle well with her foster carer. However on the 13th of March 2013 she left her foster carer's home and did not return until the 20th of March 2013. When asked where she had been Aleysha said that she had been with her mother. In early June 2013 the head of Aleysha's year at school had a preventative meeting with her and her foster carer to address a perceived deterioration in Aleysha's behaviour. Aleysha did not engage at that meeting, and her behaviour was perceived to continue to be poor. On or about the 8th of June 2013 Aleysha again left her foster carer's home and did not return until the 20th of June, on this occasion saying that she had been with her sister. On the 25th of June 2013 whilst Aleysha's sister was visiting her at her foster carer's home Aleysha reported to her carer that her sister had taken an overdose. The following evening, the 27th of June, Aleysha herself took an overdose of aspirin and paracetamol. She was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where she initially refused treatment, and even after consenting she later removed the cannula administering intravenous medication and had to be persuaded to have it restored. During Aleysha's hospital admission clinicians from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services CAMHS assessed her and a further appointment was made for her to see a CAMHS clinical psychologist after her discharge from hospital. On the 5th of July 2013 Aleysha attended that appointment with her foster carer. Aleysha did not want any further involvement with CAMHS and as Aleysha's risk of further self harm was, for various reasons, believed to be reduced, it was decided that there was no ongoing role for CAMHS at that time, although an offer of re-referral was made should matters change. When Aleysha returned to school after the summer holiday in September 2013 she was perceived as continuing to be uncooperative and difficult to engage. On a date between in or about October 2013 and at or about Christmas of 2013 one of the social workers involved with Aleysha was informed by Aleysha's foster carer that Aleysha had inflicted some superficial cuts upon herself. The social worker believed that this was a historical event and did not ask Aleysha about it. On the 7th of January 2014 Aleysha and her sister both took overdoses of aspirin and they were taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital. Clinicians wanted to admit Aleysha to the hospital for observation because she was believed to have taken a potentially life threatening overdose, but Aleysha refused to be admitted. She was seen by a doctor in the Accident and Emergency Department of the Hospital, who decided that she had the capacity to refuse treatment and noted that she was discharged. Aleysha was subsequently seen by a doctor specialising in mental health, who had concerns that Aleysha did not, in fact, have the capacity to refuse treatment. However medical staff would not then admit Aleysha to the hospital because a medical doctor had discharged her. Whilst discussions about this were continuing Aleysha left the hospital with her sister, who was also refusing treatment. Aleysha and her sister were returned to the hospital the following morning, and a mental health nurse who was a member of the Rapid Assessment Interface Discharge RAID team then assessed Aleysha. Aleysha continued to refuse to be admitted to hospital and was then assessed to have the capacity to make that decision. In the course of the assessment Aleysha told the mental health nurse that she had self harmed by cutting herself, although she had not done that recently. That information was not passed to other agencies. Particularly it was not contained in the information subsequently passed to CAMHS nor was it given to Social Services nor Aleysha's school. During the assessment Aleysha stated that she did not then want to end her life but that she had wanted to do so at the time when she had taken the overdose. At the conclusion of the assessment it was determined that whilst Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self harm she was at ongoing risk of impulsive self harm, and arrangements were made for her to have an appointment with CAMHS, despite Aleysha stating that she would not attend. Aleysha was also referred to the Safeguarding Children Team at the Royal Bolton Hospital. On the 8th of January 2014 Aleysha was seen by her school nurse, who had been informed of her hospital attendance by the Safeguarding team. Aleysha declined further support from the nurse, who did not then contact Aleysha again. On the 8th of February 2014 Aleysha and her sister were seen to be on the wrong side of the fencing of a road bridge where they were at risk of jumping or falling onto the carriageway below. Police Officers attended, and Aleysha walked off the bridge. She was then detained by the Police under the terms of the Mental Health Act and taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital, where she was seen by two doctors specialising in psychiatry and an Approved Mental Health Professional who was a social worker, for the purpose of a Mental Health Act assessment. Aleysha did not fully engage during the assessment, and denied that she had intended to harm herself when she had been on the bridge. The assessment concluded that Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self harm, but that she remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self harm. Aleysha was then discharged from detention under the Mental Health Act. A further referral was made to the Safeguarding team and to CAMHS, although Aleysha again said that she would not attend at CAMHS, stating that she did not need it. On the 11th of February 2014 a secretary working for the CAMHS team telephoned Aleysha and offered her an appointment with a mental health practitioner on the 17th of February, which Aleysha refused. On the 18th of February a social worker contacted a mental health nurse at CAMHS in order to share information regarding Aleysha particularly with regard to the events of the 8th of February described above. The ensuing discussion included an acknowledgement of the risks presented to Aleysha as a consequence of her impulsive behaviour when she was with her sister. Aleysha's refusal to engage with CAMHS was also discussed and the social worker planned that Aleysha's foster carer should be contacted and asked to encourage Aleysha to attend an appointment with CAMHS. On the 25th of February a multi agency meeting was held by social services to address Aleysha's self harming behaviour and her refusal to engage with CAMHS. CAMHS were not invited to this, nor to any other meeting. It was agreed that in view of Aleysha's refusal to engage with mental health services her foster carer should receive some training as to means of promoting Aleysha's engagement with those services. This training had not been put into place by the time of Aleysha's death on the 3rd of April 2014. On the 6th of March 2014 Aleysha was excluded from school for five days due to her bad behaviour. A meeting took place with Aleysha and her foster carer and an individual programme of lessons was agreed, so as to support Aleysha during the period leading up to her forthcoming public examinations. On the 2nd of April 2014 a pupil at Aleysha's school told Aleysha's head of year that Aleysha had self harmed by cutting her arms. Aleysha's social worker and her foster carer were informed and when they saw Aleysha an ambulance was summoned and Aleysha was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital with her foster carer following. When Aleysha was treated she was found to have twenty nine recent lacerations on her left arm, together with scarring from older wounds. Neither Aleysha's foster carer nor Social Services had previously been aware that Aleysha was self harming to this level. Whilst Aleysha's wounds were being closed the treating nurse asked Aleysha if she wanted to see anyone from the RAID team, but Aleysha declined. Despite this the nurse contacted the RAID team and a mental health nurse assessed Aleysha. The assessment concluded that on this occasion Aleysha's self harm was not an acute incident of attempted suicide but that Aleysha remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self harm. The means of treating this risk was ongoing psychological therapy such as was offered by CAMHS and the nurse conducting the assessment encouraged Aleysha to attend CAMHS despite her expressed reluctance to do so. At about 3pm on the 3rd of April 2014 Aleysha was found deceased by her foster carer at their home address. She had hanged herself. Prior to her death she had been researching websites relating to suicide and hanging. She had also taken amphetamine, which could have induced depression.","Evidence was given at the inquest that self harm in young people is becoming a public health crisis. Evidence revealed that three out of ten young people have self harmed at some time during their lives. Accordingly the matters of concern revealed were as follows

That it should be considered that the system of training for those working with young people, including teachers, school nurses, foster carers, social workers, mental health workers and medical nurses and doctors should be reviewed so as to ensure that these professionals should be alert for signs of self harm and should take opportunities to discover themselves so that those harming themselves can be offered help and support. By way of example evidence was given at the inquest that the annual health check offered to looked after children did not include a blood pressure check. If a blood pressure check was included this would provide an opportunity for signs of self harm to be revealed

That it should be considered that additional information and encouragement could be offered to young people to inform those able to help for example teachers, nurses, health professionals etc when a young person becomes aware that another young person is self harming. The shocking self harm to which Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had subjected herself was only revealed when a school friend brought it to the attention of a teacher. There was no evidence that there was any system in place to encourage the passing of such information

That it should be considered that systems such as those now being developed in Bolton should be further developed so as to ensure that multi agency discussions involving all relevant agencies are held urgently for those at risk of self harm and particularly for those who do not engage. Evidence was given that meetings concerning Aleysha Martine Karle McLoughlin did not include the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services although evidence was given that their input would have been valuable

That it should be considered that a particular pathway of help for young people who resist engagement should be developed. There was no evidence that any such formal pathway had been shared at the present time

That a review of the capacity of the agencies involved in helping young people who are self harming to address those matters appropriately should be considered","""Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin, aged 16""; ""conclusion of the inquest was that Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had committed suicide""; ""The medical cause of her death was 1a hanging"""

Harding,Mid Kent and Medway,Secretary of State for Justice; Medway Youth Offending Team; Governor Cookham Wood; Oxleas,On 1 February 2012 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alex Kelly age 15. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 December 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was that Alex Kelly died from a hypoxic brain injury having suspended himself on 24 January 2012 from a ligature made from his shoelaces which was attached to a locker within his cell at Cookham Wood Young Offenders Institution where he was serving a sentence. He died at Medway Maritime Hospital on 25 January 2012.,"Alex Kelly was a vulnerable and immature 15 year old who had suffered repeated serious sexual abuse as a very young child. He became a looked after child at the age of 6 with Tower Hamlets the Corporate Parent. He was fostered for 10 years with a family in Medway. In early adolescence Alex developed identity issues. He had variously been diagnosed with ADHD, and assessed as mildly autistic but it was common ground that his deep rooted problems had never really been addressed in the community. Alex first became involved with the Youth Courts in 2010 and until 1st August 2011 appeared repeatedly before the Youth Courts having offended and breached orders. On 1st August 2011 Alex was remanded to Cookham Wood YOI and was later bailed on 9th August 2011. This was his first time in custody. On 10th October 2011 he was further remanded to Cookham Wood and sentenced the following day to a 10 month DTO.

Whilst in custody Alex was diagnosed by a psychiatrist within the mental health in-reach team with ADHD and conduct disorder and was prescribed medication.

Alex initially engaged well with the regime but his behaviour began to deteriorate in December 2011 and an ACCT was opened on 23rd December 2011 because of his low mood and a refusal to engage in education, activities and association. The ACCT was closed on 3rd January 2012 but reopened on 6th and remained open until his death. A Behaviour Improvement Plan designed to encourage him to engage was opened on 29th December 2011 and remained open until late January. Throughout January 2012 Alex received a number of adjudication awards for blocking the observation panel to his cell or tattooing. Awards prevented him from engaging as envisaged by the Behaviour Improvement Plan.

Alex had repeatedly made marks on his arms throughout January 2012 which were variously regarded as tattooing or self-harm.

Alex's presentation throughout the period was variable, sometimes appearing in relatively good spirits but very often refusing to engage and remaining in his cell. Alex made a number of threats to take his own life by 'stringing up' but when tasked about this issue smiled or appeared to prison staff to treat it as a joke. He progressed to writing notes to the same effect and then to making ligatures with his shoelaces.

On the evening of 24th January 2012 Alex for the first time spoke of the sexual abuse that he had suffered and indicated it was all he ever thought about. He said he wanted to kill himself and that there wasn't anything officers could do about it as there would be sufficient time between observations. A short time later he telephoned his foster carers and was seen to be upset and after started to cry but stopped himself when an officer noticed. He then told another officer who had a good relationship with him and who had been asked to speak with him because he was upset, that he was going to hang himself. He repeated this to the same officer a short time later. Officers thereafter responsible for observing Alex were not informed of these disclosures.

Alex's observations were around this time increased from three to five times per hour.

He was seen inside his cell drinking a hot chocolate at which time his observation panel was partially blocked. When an officer next went to check 15 minutes later there was no response and the panel was blocked. Officers entered his cell four minutes later to find him hanging from his shoelaces which were tied to a locker.

Whilst he was at Cookham Wood YOI Alex had repeatedly stated he wanted to see his grandmother and from the beginning of January 2012 had stated that he did not want to return to his foster parents on release. At the time of his death his placement was unresolved and a number of telephone calls Alex made before he died were seeking to find a placement with people he knew.","Alex Kelly a vulnerable looked after child of 15 years with complex unresolved emotional issues and undiagnosed mental health issues was sentenced to a Detention and Training Order to be served at a Young Offender's Institution without the benefit of a forensic psychiatric assessment. Whilst I heard evidence from a psychiatrist associated with Cookham Wood YOI that the mental health in-reach team were able to address Alex's mental health needs whilst in custody, I am aware of the deaths of a number of other children in custody who similarly had not had forensic psychiatric assessments and it is for this reason I am reporting the concern. Whilst hearing evidence in relation to lessons learned I heard from the Service Manager of Medway Youth Offending Team that they have now secured the services of a psychiatric mental health nurse to assist them in the effective management of the young people for whom they have responsibilities which I was told was proving effective and is to be continued

Alex Kelly was under an ACCT between 23rd December 2011 and 3rd January 2012 and 6th January 2012 until his death. During the operation of the ACCT there was a continued conflict between the ACCT process and disciplinary procedures; outside agencies and carers were not asked to contribute; specific acts by Alex were seen as obstructive challenging behaviour rather than signs of distress or a means of communicating that he needed help his foster carers who had not been asked to contribute had some experience of Alex using non-verbal methods of communication; the ACCT reviews tended to focus on addressing specific or recent behaviours rather than the reason for the behaviour; although Alex was frequently mentioned at weekly safer regimes multidisciplinary meetings, a holistic approach was never adopted as to how he could best be supported or whether the YOI could support his needs.

Alex Kelly was without a named social worker for a period of two months at a time when he was in danger of being sent to custody and after he was sent to custody. Difficulties in allocation were not escalated to senior management.

Social workers did not transfer documentation including emails onto Framework i in a timely manner or at all. There was no system in place for ensuring that urgent electronic communications were flagged or diverted when the recipient was absent from work.

Social workers did not all appear to appreciate that their responsibilities as Corporate Parent included a role in a looked after child's welfare whilst in custody.

Shortcomings in other agencies which affected the ability of the YOT to manage the young person were not brought to the attention of management.

There were inconsistencies in recommendations as to placement in a STC or YOI which were not reconciled. Youth Offending Team keyworkers did not all appear to appreciate that their responsibilities included a role in the young person's welfare whilst in custody. Members of the Youth Offending Team did not all appear to appreciate that the Youth Offending Team could initiate a transfer within the secure estate.

Outside agencies sharing responsibility of the welfare of a young person in custody and foster carers were not kept informed of significant events, asked to participate in ACCT reviews or asked for input into the management of the young person. Although involved in the ACCT reviews the caseworker was unaware of the range of options available to safely manage the young person including requests to transfer to a different type of secure accommodation and the use of enhanced reviews. Paperwork was not submitted for early release on the basis of non-compliance with the regime and concerns about absence of a placement without consultation with any person responsible for making decisions in relation to early release.

Outside agencies sharing responsibility of the welfare of a young person in custody and foster carers were not kept informed of significant events, asked to participate in ACCT reviews or asked for input into the management of the young person.

Officers were inconsistent in the recording of significant events; entries being made in either the wing observation log, ACCT ongoing record or not at all. At least one officer did not appear to appreciate the importance of significant incidents or disclosures or report them. Significant events in a lengthy ongoing record were not highlighted and therefore not obvious to officers reviewing safeguarding provisions. Officers were unaware of the need to involve outside agencies in the ACCT review process, the range of options available to them to safely manage the young person including requests to transfer to a different type of secure accommodation and the use of enhanced reviews. The safer regimes meetings were not provided with all relevant information and were not used to their full effect. The minutes of the meetings were not fully recorded. A holistic approach was not taken to the safe management of the young person during ACCT reviews or Safer Regimes meetings when it was apparent that he was struggling with the regime and that interventions were not working.

Officers did not always seek advice before placing the young person on report for tattooing when there was an indication in the ACCT documentation that adjudication awards would lead to a heightened risk of self-harm. There was a conflict between the use of a behaviour improvement plan and adjudications which was not recognised at the time.

Paperwork was not submitted for early release on the basis of non-compliance with the regime and concerns about absence of a placement without consultation with any person responsible for making decisions in relation to early release.

There appeared to be an inflexible approach to cell entry requiring the presence of three prison officers even though YOI was in patrol state and concerns were sufficient to require entry.

Officers concerned with the management of the young person were not informed in terms of his non-compliance with medication and the potential effect of the failure to take the medication.

Medication was found stockpiled in the young person's cell; staff dispensing medication had not ensured it had been taken when it was probably recorded as having been taken. Any failure to take medication was not sufficiently flagged for healthcare or prison staff to deal with the issue.

Brown,Devon Greater District,Devon Clinical Commissioning Group; NHS England,"On 26 August 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of George Christian Werb aged 15. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 October 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative verdict: George died on 28 June 2013 on the railway track at Seaton Station, Seaton, Devon. At that time he was on home leave from inpatient care in a child psychiatric unit. Before he went on leave he was assessed as having no suicidal risk but the information used in this assessment was incomplete inaccurate and did not reflect the actual situation. Poor engagement with the family placing him in a unit a long distance from home absent note keeping and inadequate internal communications all contributed to this outcome.","George Christian Werb was receiving treatment for serious mental health issues, including a probable diagnosis of psychosis and depression, and was detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act and admitted to the Priory Hospital, Southampton on twenty-third May two thousand and fourteen for treatment. This was the nearest unit available for a child with George's needs, notwithstanding this was more than a two hour drive away from the home address, and friend and family support. George continued to receive treatment for a number of weeks, then the Section was lifted, and periods of home leave were commenced. The second of these periods of home leave commenced on twenty-seventh June two thousand and fourteen, notwithstanding that the situation had not been effectively risk assessed. Communication with the family was poor and due to the distance between the treating hospital and home address. No family therapy had been undertaken and the family had not received appropriate and full information of their son's diagnosis and the risk of suicide had not been adequately considered before leave was allowed. George walked onto a railway track near his home the morning after his home leave commenced and died when he was hit by an express train.","The community team had to spend much time making numerous telephone calls to locate a child psychiatric bed. There was not at the time, and still appears to be no, or no effective bed bureau system to identify spaces. This is wasteful of clinician time, creates inevitable delays and is indicative that there are routinely too few available beds to serve the needs of our child psychiatric patients. On a previous admission during May 2014 the bed located was in Huntercombe, and George was removed by his father as the bedroom had inadequate furniture, had no bed linen and there was concern the environment was adding to George's distress. The distance between home and this placement was in excess of three hours travel time. On the index admission, George was placed in the Priory Hospital, Southampton, a distance of over two hours travelling time from home. This is not an NHS facility and is specifically for overflow patients from all across England, many of whom are therefore huge distances from their home, their family, their friends and community support. Due to the distance, the hospital made the decision that family therapy could not take place although the parents would have engaged if the importance of this was explained and periods of home leave were extended due to travelling times, rather than in response to clinical need. There was poor attendance at the CPA meeting, and both parents and the community team only attended by telephone, which was far from ideal and impacted on the effectiveness of communication between all parties. Having local accessibility where inpatient care is required was recognised in the Mental Health Crisis Care Concordat published eighteenth February two thousand and fourteen to be important to keep the young person close to home, school and friends and this was also recognised by all the clinicians at inquest to be important and necessary. With current provision of beds this need is not being met, and is impacting on patient care. In this case I consider the distance of the unit directly contributed to the circumstances that led to George's death.","""George Christian Werb aged 15""; ""George walked onto a railway track near his home the morning after his home leave commenced and died when he was hit by an express train."""
3607,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/mary-stroman/,2014-0454,2014-10-21,D. Ridley,Wiltshire and Swindon,Mr Nick Walkley Chief Executive Haringey Council,On 16 January 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mary Elizabeth Grace Stroman aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of a two day inquest on 16 October 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mary took her own life whilst suffering from complex post traumatic stress disorder.,"Back in 2010 Mary's family lived in Hackney and their GP was based in Islington. Problems began to appear towards the end of 2010 that resulted in Mary becoming a voluntary inpatient at the Priory North in December 2010. I found as a fact that Mary's post traumatic stress disorder that was subsequently diagnosed in 2011 was linked to mental trauma sustained as a result of episode(s) of sexual abuse. Expert opinion suggested that the index episode may have occurred 12 months prior to this possibly slightly earlier than that. There more likely than not were repeated incidents. The family moved to Haringey in the summer of 2011. It is quite clear from the evidence that I heard that there were concerns from a safeguarding perspective in relation to Mary's safety away from the family home in the community and in 2012 as early as February 2012 the consultant adolescent child psychiatrist, [REDACTED] part of the Wittington Healthcare Trust was of the view that Mary would benefit from long term therapeutic placement for up to three years which could meet her educational needs whilst maintaining her safety away from the area and in particular the London Borough of Islington. That placement finally began in June 2013. In Wiltshire she was seen by [REDACTED] the last consultation was 7 January 2014 where Mary was not exhibiting suicidal ideation or indicating a plan. For some reason which is unclear as contact with Mary throughout the day of her death indicated that there was nothing as regards Mary's behaviour that caused concern. She was in fact described as perky however at some point after 7.20 pm on Wednesday 15 January 2014 she changed her clothes and walked some 800 metres to a nearby railway line where she proceeded to lie down on the track in front of an oncoming service from Portsmouth to Bristol. She died as a result of the multiple injuries she sustained in the collision.","Delay in the decision making process as regards funding the long term therapeutic placement

As early as February 2012 [REDACTED] as indicated in the previous section was supportive of the need for Mary to be placed on a therapeutic placement scheme away from the London Borough of Islington. That view was supported by [REDACTED] from Priory North and I am aware that they wrote to your local authority in November 2012 expressing their concerns due to the lack of progress. Due to the involvement of Islington who were supportive of the proposal from a healthcare perspective Mary's educational and child social services responsibilities fell to your local authority following the family's move to Haringey during the summer of 2011. I heard evidence in the form of a report from [REDACTED] who stated that at a Haringey Complex Care Panel Meeting on the 9 May 2012 it was agreed that Mary's case for joint funded placement would be advanced. A letter from the panel subsequently stated that it accepted that Mary's needs to be given the opportunity to live outside the family home and that a range of options were going to be explored. I was informed by [REDACTED] that this decision was overturned by Children's Services on the basis it did not meet a threshold for accommodation under Section 20 and that it would not be in Mary's best interests. I am aware of the involvement of a local MP and the Stroman Family's lawyers who highlighted the local authority's duty here in terms of context and it was not until March 2013 that funding was authorised by your local authority. Again in [REDACTED] report he makes reference to a further report being commissioned by Haringey Children's Services in September 2012. The assessment was completed by [REDACTED] and it concluded ""My experience may be reflective of the paralysis within the care system around this patient but ultimately of the patient's own predicament"". Whilst in the terms of Mary's inquest I did not find a direct causal link between the delay in funding Mary's placement I am concerned in relation to future cases that could impact on an individual's mental state and mental health. It is quite clear from the expert opinion evidence that I have read Mary's educational needs in particular were not being satisfied in either Simmons House or Priory North hence [REDACTED] initial recommendation. The welfare of the child must be paramount and I would ask that you review the practises and procedures that were adopted here resulting in the decision to fund Mary's long term therapeutic placement with a view to ascertaining as to whether or not lessons could be learned with a view to improving the process and reducing the delay. I fully appreciate that Mary's case was exceptionally complex but I am concerned that the delay could affect other individuals if placed in a similar situation that may lead to self harming and even death.

The temporary termination of the placement at Tumblewood August September 2013

As part of the evidence I was aware that Mary's placement was temporarily terminated as a result of an OFSTED inspection. Many pupils at Tumblewood including Mary arrive with a history of disrupted education. One of the reasons Mary was placed at Tumblewood was for this reason given her significant history of time as a voluntary inpatient in hospital and as an inpatient at another establishment both of which were felt by those involved not to address and meet her educational needs sufficiently. I am concerned as part of the process here that given that there was joint funding that the decision to terminate appears to be have been taken by your local authority without consultation with the other partner involved Islington. I am additionally concerned as regards the general decision making process here assessing the safeguarding risk as compared to the benefit of allowing Mary to continue and return to her placement after the holiday period to an environment that provided stability rather than a situation whereby the alternative did not address her educational needs and was unsettling. At the inquest I was satisfied that at the time of her death any issues that arose following her forced absence from Tumblewood were being addressed from the educational perspective which included involving Mary in that decision making process and that there was no direct causal link with her death. My concern is as regards the way your authority handles matters in the future which could potentially unsettle an individual's mental state possibly resulting in self harm or even death. Again can I ask you to review the matter with a view to looking to identify any learning points and to communicate them back to me? In evidence I was unaware of any other pupil whose placement had been terminated as a result of the same report.","""Mary Elizabeth Grace Stroman aged 16""; ""Mary took her own life""; ""she proceeded to lie down on the track in front of an oncoming service""; ""She died as a result of the multiple injuries she sustained in the collision"""
3674,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/peter-stanley/,2014-0390,2014-09-02,C. Dorries,South Yorkshire West,"Rt Hon Nicky Morgan MP, Secretary of State for Education; Rt Hon Lord McNally, Chair of the Youth Justice Board; The Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police; Chief Executive, GeoAmey",On 2 August 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Stanley aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 July 2014.,"Peter Stanley, aged just 17, was found hanging in woodland on the outskirts of Sheffield on 2 August 2013. There was a history of concern regarding Peter's mental health, his problems possibly originating from use of a so called 'legal high'. An assessment by an experienced community mental health nurse (CMHN) at the end of 2012 recognised that Peter could be developing a psychosis and he was offered a care-coordinator. Unfortunately Peter subsequently refused to engage. It was felt better that the service withdrew with an open invitation for Peter to re-engage when he was ready rather than 'harass' him and potentially spoil chances of later engagement. On 10 April 2013 Peter presented himself to the local authority as 'homeless' because his parents could no longer cope with his behaviour. He was seen by a housing officer and social worker. Peter did not want to be 'looked after' (that is go into the care of the authority) and a bed was found at a suitable establishment ('Roundabout') to provide assessment and help with more immediate issues. On 3 May Peter saw his own GP complaining of an injury to his back from 'falling downstairs'. Although not disclosed at the time it is clear that Peter suffered this injury when attempting to hang himself on stairs at his mother's address. The significant nature of his injury suggests a violent episode and given his non-disclosure at the time it would be difficult to see this as anything other than a serious attempt on his life. On 14 July Peter committed a serious and violent episode of damage at Roundabout. He was barred from the premises and thus rendered homeless. Peter was arrested for the damage and seen in the detention area by a custody nurse, because he had been banging his head on the wall. He denied any history of mental health issues and said he was only banging his head to cause trouble. Because of his behaviour Peter was subject to constant supervision in the police cells. He also required full bodily restraint at one point. Peter appeared before the Magistrates from custody next day (15 July) and was made subject of a referral order to the Youth Justice Service. The Youth Justice team (YJT) were not made aware of the bizarre behaviour in custody and arrangements were simply made to see him a week later. Later that morning Peter (now homeless) attended at the local authority Housing Department with his father, although [REDACTED] was not in the room for much of the interview. A social worker from Children's Services (SWCS) was also present. Housing had little to offer because of the circumstances in which Peter was removed from Roundabout and as there was no supported bed provision available he was declared 'intentionally homeless'. This left Peter to continue within the responsibility of Children's Services. Peter made a disclosure during this interview about his suicide attempt on the stairs but not whilst his father was present. In fact [REDACTED] never knew of the apparently serious attempt on the stairs whilst Peter was alive. There were continuing but unsuccessful efforts to find Peter more suitable accommodation than the Bed and Breakfast initially allocated. The SWCS apparently felt that the YJT would be the quickest route to a mental health assessment but despite discussion about Peter the YJT were not given any information about the mental health history or needs and nothing was put in progress. Although the Children's Services record system clearly identified the CMHN's previous involvement, he was not contacted at any time before Peter's death. On 31 July a YJT substance misuse worker saw Peter for a drug screen (not in relation to mental health). Peter told her of many thoughts about suicide, of his attempt on the stairs now four months before and of hearing voices. He said that he felt very low and was so distressed that he wanted to run into oncoming traffic or slice his own leg off. He felt that he had very little support from anyone and feared that he might be schizophrenic. This was taken seriously and a meaningful risk of self-harm was recognised although not seen as immediate. An appointment to see the YJT mental health worker (who was on leave) was made for a few days hence. The SWCS was contacted but there was little more provided. Further action was left with the YJT pending the mental health assessment the following week. The YJT determined to support Peter pending the assessment but were not really equipped to do so. No contact was attempted with Peter's father, nor any attempt to seek a medical view of the situation by telephoning Peter's GP. The following day (1 August) Peter did not attend a planned course. The YJT telephoned him twice. The first time he was plainly under the influence of drugs or alcohol and said he was unwell. When called later he was incoherent. The YJT became very worried and called the SWCS. Nothing seems to have come from this save that arrangements were made for an out of hours team to telephone Peter each morning over the coming weekend. Peter's whereabouts were unknown as he was not at the bed and breakfast. In fact, Peter was actually with his father that same afternoon. He described Peter as withdrawn, abrupt and intolerant. He plainly did not see his son as suicidal but then he had no knowledge of either the earlier attempt or of the disclosures to the substance misuse worker. They parted when he took Peter back to the bed and breakfast as he felt his behaviour was not acceptable for a planned visit to the family home. Peter's body was found some hours later. The circumstances were plainly of a deliberate self-hanging.","(1) Peter's mental health problems may have stemmed from the use of a so called 'legal high'. I understand that some, but not all, mainstream insurers have been persuaded to adopt a policy of not offering cover to establishments that sell such substances. Can this be encouraged further? (2) When young people are discharged from, or have failed to engage with, Adult Mental Health Services there is no formal 'step-down' policy. The Sheffield Child Death Overview Panel advise me that this should include a referral to a Multi Agency Support Team or Community Youth team who can then establish a key worker and 'team around the child' approach. (3) On the basis of evidence given by [REDACTED] Assistant Director of Fieldwork Services, Sheffield City Council, it is clear that the custody nurse could have accessed the Children's Services records for Peter on 14 July, even during the night, by calling the Social Services 'out of hours' team. Every local authority has an out of hours system which would cover adults as well. However I am told that this is not generally known amongst those providing custody medical services. (4) There is no specific requirement that health professionals completing assessments of young persons in custody suites include a thorough assessment of mental health. (5) A prisoner escort record known commonly as a PER would have been handed over from the police to the privatised court detention officers when Peter was produced before the magistrates. This contains details inter alia of risks, self harm issues, medical attention and warning markers. I understand that the Youth Offending Service believe that the PER should be routinely given to them it would inform assessments as to the immediate needs of the young person. This would only arise, of course, in the relatively few cases where the young person has spent a period in police cells. (6) Peter was classed as 'intentionally homeless' after his release from court on 15 July. [REDACTED] gave the court compelling evidence that this was wrong and that Peter should have been treated as a 'Child in Need'. Emphasis on the 'Child in Need' process when a young person was homeless would ensure proper assessment and sharing of information. Failures in sharing Peter's mental health history needs were significant issues in this case. This emphasis is now standard practice in Sheffield but I understand it is not likely to be the case everywhere. (7) This case shows the need for a greater number of places in supported accommodation. (8) The Sheffield Child Death Overview Panel have also recommended that no young person should be deemed intentionally homeless. (9) It is evident that front line social services practitioners are not always aware of when and where to make mental health referrals. (10) It is understood that the number of Youth Offending Service staff who have access to, and training for, the Social Services records system is limited. (11) There is no system to ensure that where there has been previous psychiatric services involvement by a young person that such information will be used to inform assessment and the 'Child in Need' planning process. (12) There is no system to ensure that when a young person has presented with previous suicidal ideology that advice is taken from health professionals regarding the potential risks. (13) There is no system to ensure that 16 and 17 year olds placed in supported accommodation have needs based access to support services, including mental health and substance misuse, irrespective of whether they fall within s.20 of the Childrens Act.","""Peter Stanley aged 17""; ""Peter Stanley, aged just 17""; ""Peter was found hanging""; ""circumstances were plainly of a deliberate self-hanging"""

This occurred during 2011 and the incident probably occurred in France. During October 2012 to January 2013 a number of events occurred including that she revealed the fact she was bulimic and the fact she had been assaulted, she took an overdose, self-harmed at a party, and wrote a number of letters which when read after her death appeared to have been suicide letters. Although she was referred by the school nurse to Child and Adult Mental Health Services (CAMHS) she was not seen until the day before she died and no one who saw her thought that she was suicidal and everyone who had dealings with her seems to have misunderstood her true feelings and intentions.",As for CAMHS part of the Foundation Trust the referral system was not working adequately and the referral was not followed up after triage even though it was classified as urgent. Staffing levels at CAMHS were inadequate in terms of pure numbers and also in terms of experience and training in connection with teenagers. Those dealing with Helena failed to recognise the escalation of the incidents in which she was involved in terms of their seriousness and their increasing frequency. As far as Cumbria County Council is concerned they are involved because I understand they are responsible for provision of the school nurse service although they contract this out to the Partnership Trust but nonetheless the responsibility lies with Cumbria County Council. I thought that the expectations of the school nurse in this particular case were totally unrealistic. I heard in evidence that she was responsible for five senior schools and twenty or more feeder schools to those five senior schools and although the total number of pupils involved was not clear it is obviously thousands rather than hundreds. She worked a twenty six hour week had forty current cases at Kirkbie Kendal School alone. The provision of service at this level is totally unfair on the school nurse concerned unrealistic in the sense that others have expectations of a school nurse which one part time provider cannot meet. The school’s counsellor had been in post for many years and there was no proof of her qualifications or her competence nor of update and training or registration with any professional body. The County Council needs to be more thorough with checking credentials.,"""date of birth 20 February 1997""; ""The cause of death was 1a Hanging""; ""she took an overdose, self-harmed at a party, and wrote a number of letters which when read after her death appeared to have been suicide letters."""

The inquest jury concluded that on the twentieth January two thousand and twelve Jake Hardy was found partially suspended in his cell at HM Young Offender Institute Hindley. The medical cause of his death was I a Hypoxic / Ischaemic Brain Injury, due to I b Cardiac Arrest, due to I c Hanging. He died as a result of his own deliberate act but the evidence did not establish, beyond reasonable doubt, whether he intended that act to cause his death. His death was caused or more than minimally contributed to by failures by the State to protect his life, namely a failure to provide him with adequate personal officer support and monitoring; a failure adequately to record and consider reports of previous self-harm and thoughts of self-harm and suicide; a failure adequately to refer to the Safeguarding Department observed and reported verbal abuse; a failure to record on C-Nomis and in the wing observation book observed and reported verbal abuse; a failure from the twenty-ninth December two thousand and eleven onwards to investigate reports that he was being verbally abused by other young persons and to take action to address such abuse; a failure on the eighteenth January two thousand and twelve onwards to provide, update and utilise under the ACCT process an adequate care map in respect of his risk of self-harm; a failure from the eighteenth January two thousand and twelve onwards to move him from cell F1/24 to a different location; a failure on the evening of the twentieth January two thousand and twelve to permit him to use the telephone; a failure on the evening of the twentieth January two thousand and twelve to supervise association properly and to protect him from the negative behaviour of other young persons towards him; a failure on the evening of the twentieth January two thousand and twelve to review the level of his risk of self-harm; a failure on the evening of the twentieth January two thousand and twelve to review the regularity with which he was checked; and a failure on the evening of the twentieth January two thousand and twelve to review the suitability of his location for his safety overnight. At the conclusion of the inquest the Interested Persons requested time to make, and respond to, written submissions concerning my duty to make a report to prevent future deaths. I granted the request because of the complexity of the facts and issues considered during the inquest and the quantity of documentary material relating to changes which have been made since Jake Hardy's death. I have received written submissions from all the Interested Persons, the last being received on the twenty-second May two thousand and fourteen. I have since taken time to review the evidence and to consider all the submissions and all the documentary material before me.","Jake Hardy was a 17 year-old young man from Chesterfield, Derbyshire who was sentenced to a detention and training order and sent to HM YOI Hindley, Wigan in December 2011. He was a young person with a number of vulnerabilities. He had been diagnosed as having learning and behavioural difficulties, had been issued with a Statement of Special Educational Needs and had attended a special needs school. He had a low reading age and was emotionally immature. He also had a history of being bullied by his peers at school and some history of self-harming behaviour and suicidal ideation. He relied heavily on his family, especially his mother, for emotional support.

As the jury's findings show, several of the policies and procedures then in place within the HM YOI Hindley designed to identify, monitor and protect vulnerable detainees and those at risk of self-harm were not utilised either as fully as they should have been or at all in relation to Jake. Further, there were failures by prison and clinical staff both to consider and to record relevant information in Jake's records.

Over the seven weeks that Jake was in HM YOI Hindley he told staff on a number of occasions that he was being verbally bullied by other detainees but no referral was made to the Safeguarding Department until shortly before his death. Further, a written report made in late December 2011 by Jake's Youth Offending Service worker, linking the verbal abuse to Jake's risk of self-harm and suicide, did not result in effective protective steps being taken.

After evening lock-up on the 17th January 2012, Jake smashed the television in his cell and used the broken glass to self-harm. He was placed on an Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork process but the jury found that, when it was reviewed, there was a failure to create an adequate care map in respect of his risk of further self-harm.

When questioned about the incident, Jake stated that he was being verbally bullied and that detainees in other cells were shouting out obscenities about his family. Subsequently, perpetrators of the verbal abuse were identified but no action was taken to re-locate either them or Jake, in part because Jake resisted this. Jake's mood and presentation between the 17th and 20th January was variable but concern for his mental health and his safety were raised when he was disciplined for breaking his television.

On the 20th January 2012 Jake appeared to be calm and cheerful during the day but he became angry and upset when the prison staff supervising evening association forgot to unlock his cell as he had wanted to telephone his mother, to whom he had not spoken for several days, before the other detainees were released from their cells. He was told by the staff that he could use the telephone later, although this was not in fact permitted because of his subsequent behaviour.

During the association period Jake remained in his cell and a number of detainees congregated outside his door. The evidence revealed that some of those detainees behaved in a harassing manner towards Jake, opening and closing his observation flap, hitting his door and calling and gesturing to him. Supervising staff did not take any or sufficient steps to prevent or stop this. Jake was again angry and upset and he repeatedly tried to cover his observation panel with paper and he was kicking his door for over an hour. Further, shortly after evening association was finished, Jake was found to have broken the furniture in his cell.

Despite Jake's presentation and behaviour, the prison staff failed prior to final lock-up to review under the ACCT procedure the level of Jake's risk of self-harm, the regularity with which he was to be checked overnight and the suitability of his location for his safety overnight. Jake was found by night staff less than an hour later, on a routine check, to be partially suspended by a ligature tied to a window bar.","It was apparent from the evidence I heard that a significant proportion of the children and young persons placed in HM YOI Hindley are vulnerable and have complex needs. This may well be true of the children and young persons placed in other Youth Offender Institutions also. Clearly, the nature and extent of Jake Hardy's vulnerabilities were not unusual amongst this population, with many detainees having some form of learning difficulty. I was told that other detainees are vulnerable for different reasons, for example because they have been abused or neglected or their upbringing has been adversely affected by a parent's misuse of alcohol or drugs. Many are looked after children. I was also told that these detainees' complexities affect their reaction to authority and boundaries and are probably the reason they ended up in custody in the first place. It was also apparent that vulnerable detainees are likely to lack the emotional and intellectual maturity and resilience they may need to cope with the pressures of life in custody such as separation from family and bullying and that the risk of self-harm and suicide can increase in consequence. I was told that safeguarding these detainees is made more difficult by the prevalence of their volatile and unpredictable behaviour. Overall, the evidence suggested that the placement of vulnerable children and young persons with complex needs in the environment of a Youth Offender Institute particularly if some distance from home does, in some cases, result in an increased risk of self-harm and suicide which it is often difficult for prison and clinical staff to manage effectively, even with the benefit of the various policies and procedures which are in place. As stated above, significant changes of policy and procedure have been introduced at HM YOI Hindley in order to address concerns raised about the identification, monitoring and protection of vulnerable children and young persons and those at risk of self-harm and suicide. It may well be that some or all of those changes would provide better protection to detainees in other Young Offender Institutes but I am not aware that consideration has been given to the adoption of these changes elsewhere in the estate. A number of the prison staff from HM YOI Hindley who gave evidence at the inquest clearly lacked any or sufficient aptitude or temperamental suitability for the demands of working with vulnerable young persons with complex needs and or any or sufficient understanding of those needs and their causes such as the nature and effect of specific learning difficulties and the effect of abuse or neglect in childhood. I have been told that these matters are now addressed to some extent by the Youth Justice Board and HM YOI Hindley but that further changes are being considered to the way in which prison staff working in Young Offender Institutes are recruited, screened for aptitude and trained. I report this concern so that any outstanding further steps can be considered. The evidence revealed an almost complete failure to provide Jake Hardy with the benefit and protection of a Personal Officer, despite a comprehensive scheme being in place. Currently the scheme is of pivotal importance for the identification and monitoring of vulnerability and risk. There remains a concern about whether all officers at HM YOI Hindley have a sufficient understanding of this role and its importance and about the absence of any system to alert managers to any failure by a Personal Officer to meet his obligations under this scheme or to audit his performance. This concern may be of relevance to other Young Offender Institutes also. Cells containing ligature points such as window bars are still in use at HM YOI Hindley for detainees who have been assessed to be at risk of self-harm or suicide. This concern may be of relevance to other Young Offender Institutes also. Verbal bullying by means of detainees shouting out at night is a common problem in HM YOI Hindley and can increase the risk of self-harm and suicide by those targeted, especially overnight. The fabric, layout and design of the cells in HM YOI Hindley does not remedy this problem. Further, it is difficult for the night orderly officer on duty on a wing, who is there alone, to tackle the problem effectively. There is no effective system in place to ensure that the problem is routinely monitored and tackled effectively, whether by means of additional staff or otherwise. This concern may be of relevance to other Young Offender Institutes also. The children and young persons detained at HM YOI Hindley are provided with a weekly credit which they may use to telephone family or other approved numbers. Calls are made from a communal telephone located in the association area of a wing. Prison staff have a discretion to permit further calls to be made from an office telephone for good reason. I was told that in-cell telephony has been introduced in newly built parts of the children and young persons' estate but it is not available in HM YOI Hindley and other Young Offender Institutes. Currently, therefore, these detainees are not able to speak privately on the telephone and there is no sufficient system in place to ensure that a child or young person in crisis or in need of emotional support whether by reason of being bullied or experiencing feelings of self-harm or suicide can speak to a family member without significant delay. The shift patterns of Senior Officers working on the wings within HM YOI Hindley are such that they do not always overlap and handover is often by means of written entries in a handover book. The handover book I saw contained short notes addressing random matters and there was apparently no routine recording of a more comprehensive review of the shift. There is no system in place to ensure that important information and outstanding tasks are sufficiently recorded by one Senior Officer at the end of his shift and then read by the next Senior Officer at the start of his shift. It was clear from the evidence that it is the Senior Officer's responsibility to have an overview of what is happening on the wing and matters of relevance to the safeguarding of detainees housed there. Therefore, the passing of key information and outstanding tasks between Senior Officers on a wing is of real importance to the safety of detainees. This concern may be of relevance to other Young Offender Institutes also.","""Jake Reginald Hardy, aged 17 years""; ""The medical cause of his death was I a Hypoxic / Ischaemic Brain Injury, due to I b Cardiac Arrest, due to I c Hanging.""; ""He died as a result of his own deliberate act""; ""a history of self-harming behaviour and suicidal ideation"""

Hashmi,Manchester North,"Affinity Healthcare Ltd; Manchester Mental Health & Social Care Trust; Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust; Department of Health; Faculty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Royal College of Psychiatrists","On the 8 January 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Miss Samiyo Sahra Shih Farah then aged 17 years of 1 Outringham Drive, Openshaw, Manchester. The investigation was concluded at the end of the inquest on the 16 April 2014. The conclusion of the jury at inquest was that the deceased killed herself whilst suffering from depression and was combined with a brief narrative.","The deceased was a highly articulate and intelligent young woman who had moved to the UK with her family in around 2004. She had a history of self-harm since the age of 14. On the 30th October 2012, Miss Farah consulted her GP who diagnosed depression. On the 31st October 2012, she was admitted to the A & E department having taken an overdose of paracetamol. She was subsequently transferred to an adult MAU under the care of Registered General Nurses for medical treatment of the overdose. Miss Farah was seen on admission by the nurse-led Mental Health Liaison team (MHL). This was said to have been the process in place within the trust at the material time. The deceased was not therefore referred directly to a Consultant Psychiatrist for assessment. The MHL nurse appraised MAU staff regarding Miss Farah's presenting condition and advised that if they had any concerns regarding her mental health, then further contact could be made with the MHL team. The MHL nurse did not see the deceased again until discharge on the 8th November, although she participated in a multi strategy meeting in the interim. Anti-depressant therapy was not instigated on the basis that medication was only one of a variety of types of treatment. During the course of her admission, the deceased made allegations against family members which triggered a safeguarding investigation. This necessitated the involvement of the multi-disciplinary team. The allegations made were unsubstantiated and the deceased was discharged home with a plan of care in the community (Child & Adolescent Mental Health Team - CAMHs - and intensive home treatment team). A children's social worker was involved in the discharge planning process, however it was unclear what or how many different discharge options were made available to the deceased at this time. Whilst on the face of it Miss Farah appeared more settled following discharge, her family felt that she continued to demonstrate uncharacteristic behaviour. On the 26th November 2012, the deceased's mother discovered that her daughter had purchased a large number of paracetamol and cocodamol tablets. She called for an emergency ambulance. Miss Farah was described as appearing happy at the prospect of readmission. Miss Farah was seen by doctors at the same A & E department whereupon she was referred to a Psychiatrist for assessment. Whilst the decision to refer directly to a physician was no doubt wholly appropriate, it was at odds with the previously identified referral process (MHL) particularly bearing in mind the circumstances surrounding admission on each occasion. Nonetheless, the deceased was diagnosed as suffering from marked depression with suicidal ideation. Arrangements were therefore made for her to be admitted directly to an adolescent mental health unit on the 27th November. The only bed available at the time was in the private sector. This bed was commissioned with the proviso that as soon as an NHS bed became available, the deceased would be repatriated. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health team (CAMHs) became involved and a lead practitioner was identified. Following admission, the deceased was placed on 1:5 observations. A STAR Risk Assessment was initiated following admission and completed subsequently. A key nurse was allocated but she went on leave very soon after the deceased's arrival. There was conflicting evidence regarding whether associate nurses were used or allocated and at what grade (the associate acting in the absence of the key nurse). Between the 13th and 15th December 2012 Miss Farah self-harmed by ligature (shoelaces) twice and was found head-banging against a wall. She remained on 1:5 observations. The STAR risk assessment tool was not updated at the time, nor was it updated prior to repatriation. A bed became available at the NHS hospital sometime after the 17th December. Miss Farah was unhappy to transfer to another unit as she had started to form therapeutic relationships with staff and felt safe where she was, on 1:5 observations. She made her views known to those caring for her. On or around the 18th December, the doctor in charge of Miss Farah's care formed the view that it was clinically preferable for her to remain. He allocated the task of contacting the Commissioners to the staff nurse on the ward round. This, it was subsequently conceded, was inappropriate and that contact with the Commissioners should have been tasked to a senior manager or have been the responsibility of the clinician himself. The ward round ended late, by which time the funding office who held the contact details for the Commissioners had closed. The staff nurse maintained that as he was unable to contact the Commissioners, he rang the NHS unit directly in order to put forward both the patient's view and the clinical preference of the doctor only to be told that the transfer was to go ahead the next day. Communication between CAMHs, the private hospital and NHS provider was limited to say the least. The CAMHs lead was not advised of Miss Farah's wish to stay at the private unit, the date of her transfer or the self-harm incidents of the 13th to 15th December. Had he been made aware of her views and the clinical preference of the Consultant, then he would have escalated matters to his manager. Miss Farah was transferred to NHS care on the 19th December. En route, the escorting Health Care Assistant purchased shoelaces for the deceased from the shop next to the NHS unit with, he maintained, the full agreement and knowledge of the discharging staff nurse. This was so as to ensure the patient's dignity. The escorting Health Care Assistant maintained that he handed over the transfer documentation and gave a brief verbal handover to a nurse on the accepting unit. This handover included bringing the recent purchase of shoelaces to their attention. The staff at the NHS unit maintained that they were not advised of the ligature or self-harm incidents of the 13th to 15th December and that had they been told, they would have questioned the appropriateness of the deceased's transfer and had the transfer been agreed, that this information would have materially altered their plan of care for the deceased. A STAR risk assessment was completed by the Occupational Therapist following admission. The deceased was later seen by the junior doctor and placed on 1:15 observations following discussion with the Consultant. It was subsequently conceded that a call ought to have been made to the transferring unit to enquire as to why the deceased had been on 1:5 observations for 22 days prior to transfer as this was unusual. Initially, Miss Farah was placed on the acute corridor (three young people were in residency at the time, with two staff). After a short period, she was transferred to the main ward area. On the 23rd December 2012, a search was conducted of Miss Farah's room, along with the rooms of two of her peers. The deceased had allegedly been passing contraband to others within the unit. Items found within the deceased's room included strips of material taken from an item of her clothing, two pairs of shoelaces (one set hidden under a bed pillow), broken CDs and a plastic bag was found hidden upon her person. The deceased had previously researched the use of exit bags as a way of self-harming. The contraband items were confiscated. The deceased was allowed to keep her clothing and was kept on 1:15 observations. The STAR risk assessment was not updated until the 28th December. Key staff and managers were however notified via the Datix system, save for the Consultant responsible for Miss Farah's care. He was a locum at the time and was not included within this notification process. He was told of the incident the following day and observed Miss Farah on the ward with no direct patient contact. The patient observation rate remained 1:15. On the 30th December 2012, a unit search was directed by senior managers. At 09:30 a nurse entered Miss Farah's room but could not wake her. He called for a female member of staff to assist before approaching the deceased. Miss Farah was found unresponsive in her bed with a non-suspension ligature around her neck. The ligature had been constructed from shreds of fabric from her clothing. CPR was commenced and paramedics summoned. Life was confirmed extinct at 10:02 on the 30th December. During a search of the deceased's room by police after her death, a serrated drink can was discovered hidden in the deceased's bag. The senior investigating officer believed that this item may have been used to create the shreds of clothing used to form the ligature.","Observation protocol - there is no national guidance or policy on the observation of children and adolescents within specialist mental health units. At present, clinicians are forced to adopt or adapt policies applied to adults with mental health issues. The care needs of young people are quite different to those of adults. Communication or contact between transferring establishments - there is no formal policy or protocol in use between the private sector and the NHS detailing steps that should be taken and by whom upon transfer of patients between sectors, thus risking that not all key information both verbal and written is properly communicated before, during and after transfer. Whilst progress is being made in this regard at local level following the death of Miss Farah and may well be the basis upon which any national policy or protocol might be formulated, there is currently no communication or transfer protocol in existence. This also potentially impacts upon all other healthcare sector providers for example the acute sector, hospital to care home, acute to rehabilitation or community services etc. There appears to have been an inconsistency of approach following Miss Farah's admissions to A and E. She was referred directly to a psychiatrist on the second attendance when she was clearly unwell but had not managed to self-harm but was not on the first attendance when she had taken an overdose. This also raises the question as to whether she ought to have been referred to a psychiatrist on the thirty-first of October two thousand and twelve.","""Miss Samiyo Sahra Shih Farah then aged 17 years""; ""the deceased killed herself""; ""Life was confirmed extinct at 10:02 on the 30th December"""

Hassell,Inner North London,The Right Honourable Jeremy Hunt MP Secretary of State for Health Department of Health,"On 18 October 2012, one of the assistant coroners for Inner North London commenced an investigation into the death of Tallulah Wilson, a fifteen year old schoolgirl. I concluded the investigation at the end of the inquest on 22 January 2014. The jury made a narrative determination, finding that Tallulah jumped in front of a train, taking her own life.","The jury found that, as a result of Tallulah's dissatisfaction with her friendship group, she created an online persona. She posted about self harm and suicide. She included photographs that she said were of herself following cutting. Her consultant psychiatrist gave evidence that, with hindsight, it seems that when her Tumblr account was deleted following her mother's discovery of the damaging nature of her posts, Tallulah may have felt herself to be in some way deleted. Thousands of people had read her posts and she had gained great satisfaction from that. So on the one hand, her internet use may have had a negative impact; and yet on the other hand, preventing her internet use may have had a negative impact.","Although Tallulah was treated by a number of healthcare professionals, and her mother was extremely concerned about her wellbeing, no person who gave evidence felt that, at the time they were looking after Tallulah, they had a good enough understanding of the evolving way that the internet is used by young people, most particularly in terms of the online life that is quite separate from, but sometimes seems to be used to try to validate, the rest of life. Research; the development of improved clinical practice at a national level, details of which are then disseminated by national training; and risk assessment refinement, all seem to be key. Digital lives basic training and audit is already available, but is not part of standard induction training to raise awareness for all in psychiatric and psychological fields, let alone for all doctors. I heard at inquest that the Department of Health has taken the lead nationally on youth suicide prevention, commissioning research exploring the use of the internet and trying to understand the role of social media in youth suicides.
