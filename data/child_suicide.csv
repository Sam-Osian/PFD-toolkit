Royal College of Paediatrics & Child Health, NHS England 2. President, Royal College of Psychiatrists, London Office, 21 Prescot Street, London, E1 8BB 3. Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP, Secretary of State for Health & Social Care E","On 3 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Allison Vivian Jacome Aules. Allison was 12 years old when she passed away on the 19th July 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 17th August 2023. The conclusion was that Allison died as a result of suicide, contributed to by neglect.","Allison Aules was referred to the mental health team in May 2021 with concerns around evidence of self-harm, low mood, anxiety and enuresis. Her case was inappropriately screened as routine and the referral was triaged 8 weeks later. Allison was not communicated with at this time, but her mother shared a full account of concerns with the triage psychologist. Additional concerns were raised during triage and the matter was taken to a multi-disciplinary team. The team decided that Allison should be assessed face to face. They determined the case to be low risk and placed it in the green zone. The concerns shared with the service should have resulted in a more urgent face to face assessment. The assessment of Allison took place 9 months later. This was not a face-to-face assessment, as directed by the multi-disciplinary team. There was a telephone discussion, initially with Allison's mother alone. Allison later spoke to the assessor but there was no full assessment of her mental state. There was no full exploration of the concerns raised in the referral and in the triage discussion. There was no evidence of the assessor determining the cause of Allison's worrying presentation. There was no carefully documented assessment of risk. There was no carefully devised risk management plan. A decision was made to discharge Allison from the mental health team, with no multi-disciplinary review or liaison with the referrer. Allison continued to receive counselling provided at her school, but this concluded at the end of term, on the 15 July 2022. On the 18 July 2022 Allison was found suspended in her bedroom. The failure to provide basic mental health care to Allison contributed to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced. The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern. The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country. There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams. The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor. The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10 – 12 per week. The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week. There is a concern that ongoing under resourcing of CAMHS services (whilst demand continues to increase), will result in future similar deaths. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 April 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that: on 3 June 2019, Leah Barber was found deceased at the Bolton Woods Quarry, Bolton Hall Road in Bradford. Leah was suffering a range of mental health pressures in the last 18 months of her life, and her mental health fluctuated in the terms of the nature and severity of those pressures. She had previous thoughts of taking her own life and had tried to do so on two occasions. [REDACTED] On the morning of 3 June 2019 Leah left a note at her home address for family which indicated an intent to take her own life. From the location within the quarry at which she was discovered and a post-mortem examination it was apparent that Leah had fallen from a height of around 30 metres. The evidence showed that Leah had taken her own life. The medical cause of death was: 1a. Multiple injuries with inhalation of water 1b. Fall from a height",As per box 3 (immediately above).,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) A detailed review of the evidence in this case, which included evidence from two Schools ( ), as well as from Bradford Children's Social Services, the TRACKS Education team (at Bradford Council), the SCIL Team and the Council's SEND Team, revealed that no one person or department at Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Bradford Council had an overview of Council's involvement in relation to Leah (prior to her death). Of greater concern was that that remained so after each of the Council departments involved were notified that Leah had passed away. Every organisation which had contact with the Coroner's service in relation to Leah's death, with the exception of Bradford Council, was able to provide the Court with an overview/analysis of their involvement with Leah prior to her death and (where appropriate) the lessons they had learnt as a result their involvement with Leah. The Police and the local Mental Health Trust were examples of two public bodies who had and were able to provide an overview/analysis to the Court in terms of their involvement with Leah and confirm whether there were any lessons to be learned by them. The evidence provided by witnesses from the various Bradford Council teams which were involved with Leah, showed a clear disconnect in the involvement of the various Council departments. That was not caused by those individuals who had provided written statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide oral evidence. Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actions/omissions on the part of individuals/teams within the Council which more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Leah's death, the concern is that Bradford Council appeared not to have a system/process in place which allowed anyone (whether an individual / a team) within the Council to have an overview of deaths where there had been previous Council involvement with the deceased (in this case a child). In the apparent absence of such oversight Bradford Council would not be able to learn lessons from such cases (or even know if there were lessons to be learned). The absence of such a single point of oversight as was apparent in Leah's case, contributes to the risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. 6"

Molly Ann Sergeant died on the 16 October 2020. The investigation concluded at the end of the 5-day inquest on 7 December 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was Narrative with a medical cause of death of '1a Hanging","Molly-Ann Sergeant was found deceased on 16 October 2020 hanged [REDACTED] in Woodlands [REDACTED] with the intention of ending her life and left a note. Molly was treated for depression and had a history of chronic self-harm that had required a prolonged hospital admission at St Aubyn's under the Mental Health Act and did not accept her diagnosis with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Molly was discharged on 17 August 2020 following phased community leave with a plan in place for her mental health. Confusion between different statutory provisions led to her case being closed to social care and, significant delays in this case being reopened. Molly was allocated a social worker five weeks after her discharge for an assessment that was ongoing. Molly attended her Care Programme Approach meeting on 9th October 2020 and left distressed. Suicide – Social care failed to carry out appropriate requested assessments during Molly's prolonged hospital admission and there was not a coherent co- ordinated approach to meeting Molly's social aftercare needs. Molly's right to aftercare services was recorded but the functions were not discharged as they should have been during her admission, and this contributed to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Molly had a delayed diagnosis of Autism. Molly was diagnosed during her detention at the St. Aubyn Centre when she experienced a mental health crisis and detained under the Mental Health Act. (2) There was insufficient assessment for discharge planning purposes of the impact of Molly's recent diagnosis of Autism by Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (3) There was insufficient consideration given to the impact of Molly's delayed diagnosis of Autism on her chronic high risk of suicide in her discharge and discharge planning in a background of Molly not accepting her diagnosis. (4) Lack of escalation to Essex County Council when there was a failure to respond to requests for assessment and attendance at discharge planning meetings and the key worker/care co-ordinator carrying too heavy a workload as a consequence. (5) Essex County Council did not: a. act on appropriate referrals to social care by Essex Partnership NHS Trust b. conduct required assessments of Molly during her detention c. did not appoint a social worker until after Molly was discharged 3 There was a lack of understanding of the impact of Molly's detention on her right to assessment as a child in need and how this changed during her detention under the Mental Health Act. (6) A lack of understanding of section 117 Mental Health Act rights and potential for consideration for entitlements to meet Molly's needs related to her mental health disorder, by Essex County Council: a. compelling Molly to choose between family members as part of her discharge planning and then as a consequence changing Molly's status during her detention from homeless. b. Lack of assessment for any s117 needs to facilitate discharge c. Lack of appreciation of the impact of Molly's autism diagnosis in a background of chronic suicide risk on decision-making and Molly's potential to understand the decisions being made. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28th September 2022. I concluded with a narrative conclusion of:- Jade, who was vulnerable, had been struggling with his mental health. He had been using alcohol and drugs to mask underlying issues and he had been finding it difficult to engage with services in order to address this. There were missed opportunities by a number of services to proactively engage with Jade to ensure that he was being encouraged to address his dependency on alcohol and drugs and notably the missed opportunity to carry out a child in need review when Jade was approaching 18 which did not occur due to his case being closed prematurely. Jade's death was contributed to by neglect. 4","In 2019 Jade's behaviour started to deteriorate. He dropped out of St Pauls' College and started to get involved in criminal activity. He came to the attention of Children Services, the Mental Health Service and the Police (having been the victim of assaults, being involved in domestic disputes and having been arrested for aggravated burglary). Alcohol and substance misuse played a substantive part in his lifestyle. At 22:07 on 20 May 2020 Mrs Hutchings (Jade's mother) reported to the police that Jade (who was 18 at the time) had not returned home. She said that he had left the house at 17:00 under the influence of alcohol and drugs saying that he would be back soon. He didn't return so Mrs Hutchings contacted his friends but they had not heard from him. She was Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 concerned for her son as this was out of character for him and he had previously been assaulted. The Police treated Jade as a missing person and tried to locate Jade. At 03:00 police located Jade at Hastings Town Centre. He was drunk. The Police did not detain him under Section 136 Mental Health Act as they did think it was necessary. They transported him back home to Haywards Heath. On arriving home he went to bed. When Jade woke up the following morning, he was argumentative with his mother. He eventually calmed down and apologised. Later that morning his mother and sister left the house to go to the shops. They arrived back home at about 14:00 and went upstairs where they found Jade hanging Mrs Hutchings and some of her neighbours began CPR on Jade and an ambulance arrived along with several police officers who assisted with CPR. Jade was taken to Brighton Hospital where despite treatment he died on 23rd May 2020. The Cause of death is recorded as: - 1a Hypoxic Brain Injury 1b Asphyxia due to Hanging by Hanging 21/5/20 5","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Inadequate Police training on Mental Health During the course of the Inquest officers involved in dealing with Jade (and in particular around the exercise of their Section 136 powers on 21/5/20) acknowledged that they had received very little mental health training. Some officers could not recall any additional training provided since their initial training when they first joined the force. The officers admitted that although they were aware of the Sussex Police mental health guide they had not read it in full. The expert police witness, , told the Inquest that in his view the online training provision that we were told was being rolled out in Sussex was not sufficient. None of the officers involved in this case had yet undertaken this online training. It was his opinion that officers should be provided with the nationally recognised two day training course written by the College of Policing, The course is available for all Police forces to be rolled out locally. This training had not been adopted by Sussex Police. There was also confusion amongst Officers (and a lack of clear understanding) around the provision and use of service the Haven at Millview could provide. 2. REBOOT - Lack of provision to for older age group There was clear evidence that Jade was vulnerable and had become involved in violence and crime in 2019 (the year before his death). It was believed by some that Jade exploited by gangs running county line drug operations. A need for an early intervention was identified by his social worker and a referral to Reboot was made. The Inquest was told that at the time REBOOT was prioritising 12 – 14 years children and as Jade was nearing 18 they were unable to work with him. This was a missed opportunity for Jade to be involved in a form of early intervention before his life started unravelling and he became more heavily entrenched in the world of crime. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 It is understood that at the time of Jade's death the Police and Crime Commissioner was responsible for the REBOOT scheme but at the time of writing this report the scheme is now run by Sussex Police. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The inquest started on Tuesday 11 October 2022 and concluded today, Friday 14 October 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. 4","Charley Ann Patterson Deceased suffered with low mood and anxiety related to a number of factors including the restrictions in place due to COVID-19, relationship difficulties with peers and other influences. She had suffered bullying in the period leading up to her death through electronic means. She shared two known previous instances of self-harm involving cutting to her arms which were superficial in nature. She voluntarily attended Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington with her mother at approximately 20.00 hours on 29th May 2020 after she had self-harmed for the second time a few days prior. She was assessed and promptly referred to and seen by the Psychiatric Liaison Team at approximately 21.30 hours. There · were superficial cuts to the left arm which did not require medical intervention and she wanted support with her anxiety and low self-esteem and to learn positive coping strategies for times of emotional distress due to a number of factors. As part of the discharge plan on 29 May 2020 she was referred to the Young Persons Universal Crisis Team and an assessment with them took place upon agreement via telephone on 1 June 2020. She did not meet the criteria for referral to Children and Young Peoples Service as she did not present with a significant degree of psychological dis tress or mental health difficulty. She was discharged with support netting and a plan where it was discussed and agreed with her and her mother that there would be a referral to the Northumberland (Early Help) Hub. No referral to the Northumberland (Early Help) Hub was made. There was no referral to the mental health trust saf eguarding team and there was an absence of communication 5 with other services and professionals although it is not possible to say if those referrals and steps had been undertaken whether the outcome would have been any different. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was commenced, and paramedics arrived, and a return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. She was conveyed by ambulance to Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington and upon arrival was in cardiac arrest. Despite continued attempts at resuscitation life was confirmed extinct at 19.31 hours on 1 October 2020 within Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington. Charley Ann Patterson had left a number of drawings and a note with references to the intention of ending her life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ­ (1) During the course of the inquest, it was a concern to me the increase in the number of children and young people who are now being seen with regard to their emotional well- being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them requiring support and assessment since the Coronavirus pandemic and the delays that now exist before they receive treatment and support. (2) I heard that in 2020 if the criteria for referral had been met for referral to Children's Adolescent Mental Health Services there would have been a triage of the child or young person within 8 weeks, treatment within up to 19 weeks with the number of referrals at that time being 1,595. In 2022, subject to meeting the criteria for referral, there would be a triage of the child or young person within 3 weeks but that the waiting time for treatment has increased from up to 19 weeks to up to 63 weeks with the number of referrals being 2,275. (3) I heard evidence from Cramlington Learning Village where Charley was a pupil and they told me since Charley's death they have strengthened their support for children suffering from anxiety and other mental health issues by increasing the mental health learn, employing two emotional literacy teaching assistants, a Mental Health and Well Being Practitioner, another Thrive Practitioner and increased the number of Deputy Safeguarding Leads to 5. (4) I heard from a Paediatric Nurse Practitioner who is based in the Accident and Emergency at Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington who told me in evidence that in 2020 it was the case that she would see a referral from a child or young person struggling with emotional distress, anxiety, mental health difficulties and instances of self-harm and overdose once a week but that since the Coronavirus pandemic the incidence of assessments for children and young people with those issues has risen from once per week to once per shift. I also heard from the Group Nurse Director forCumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust in the North Locality who told me that in May 2020 she would see 100 referrals a month from children experiencing anxiety and mental health difficulties but in May 2022 the number of referrals has increased to 300 children per month. The reason for the referrals is complex but includes the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic with staff seeing an increase in demand in the numbers of young people suffering with anxiety, low self-esteem, bod image, OCD and instances of self-harm and overdose. (5) I ask for there to be an assessment of the services and resources that can be offered to meet the increase in demand in the number of children and young people seeking support with regard to their emotional well-being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them since the Coronavirus pandemic and to reduce the delay in receiving early support in order to avoid a mental health crisis. 6"

I opened an inquest on the 1st December 2017. The inquest concluded on the 30th September 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was “Molly Rose Russell died from an act of self-harm whilst suffering from depression and the negative effects of on-line content”. The medical cause of death was 1a Suspension. 4","Molly Rose Russell was found having hanged herself on the Twenty- First of November 2017. Molly was 14 years old. Molly appeared a normal healthy girl who was flourishing at school, having settled well into secondary school life and displayed an enthusiastic interest in the Performing Arts. However, Molly had become depressed, a common condition affecting children of this age. This then worsened into a depressive illness. Molly subscribed to a number of online sites. At the time that these sites were viewed by Molly some of these sites were not safe as they allowed access to adult content that should not have been available for a 14-year-old child to see. The way that the platforms operated meant that Molly had access to images, video clips and text concerning or concerned with self-harm, suicide or that were otherwise negative or depressing in nature. The platform operated in such a way using algorithms as to result, in some circumstances, of binge periods of images, video clips and text some of which were selected and provided without Molly requesting them. These binge periods, if involving this content are likely to have had a negative effect on Molly. Some of this content romanticised acts of self- harm by young people on themselves. Other content sought to isolate and discourage discussion with those who may have been able to help. Molly turned to celebrities for help not realising there was little prospect of a reply. In some cases, the content was particularly graphic, tending to portray self- harm and suicide as an inevitable consequence of a condition that could not be recovered from. The sites normalised her condition focusing on a limited and irrational view without any counterbalance of normality. It is likely that the above material viewed by Molly, already suffering with a depressive illness and vulnerable due to her age, affected her mental health in a negative way and contributed to her death in a more than minimal way. 5","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The following matters were raised during the Inquest:- 1. There was no separation between adult and child parts of the platforms or separate platforms for children and adults. 2. There was no age verification when signing up to the on-line platform. 3. That the content was not controlled so as to be age specific. 4. That algorithms were used to provide content together with adverts. 5. That the parent, guardian or carer did not have access, to the material being viewed or any control over that material. 6. That the child's account was not capable of being separately linked to the parent, guardian or carer's account for monitoring. I recommend that consideration is given by the Government to reviewing the provision of internet platforms to children, with reference to harmful on-line content, separate platforms for adults and children, verification of age before joining the platform, provision of age specific content, the use of algorithms to provide content, the use of advertising and parental guardian or carer control including access to material viewed by a child, and retention of material viewed by a child. I recommend that consideration is given to the setting up of an independent regulatory body to monitor on-line platform content with particular regard to the above. I recommend that consideration is given to enacting such legislation as may be necessary to ensure the protection of children from the effects of harmful on-line content and the effective regulation of harmful on-line content. Although regulation would be a matter for Government I can see no reason why the platforms themselves would not wish to give consideration to self-regulation taking into account the matters raised above. 6"

Cygnet Health Care 2. NHS England 1,"On 19 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney born on 11 September 2003. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which commenced on 7 March 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was:- On the 10th of April 2021 in Cygnet Hospital, Sheffield, Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney performed an act of self-harm by tying 2 non-fixed ligatures. As a result of insufficient care, crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response, this led to her unexpected death two days later on the 12th of April in the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield. There was also a jury questionnaire which was completed and is appended to this Regulation 28 report for information. The medical cause of death was: 1a: Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 4","Mental Health Overview It is clear from the evidence that was heard during the inquest that Chelsea initially developed a type of eating disorder that required support. She was admitted to a number of mental health inpatient units leading to her admission to Cygnet in Sheffield. Whilst in this facility a number of material things happened:- 1. Chelsea began to self-harm using ligatures which was a new behaviour 2. Chelsea's working diagnosis became PTSD 3. Chelsea made a number of allegations of abuse by members of her family and others which required investigating 2 4. Chelsea declined to share information with her family Chelsea's family were advised that young people are not given a fixed diagnosis and that the working diagnosis was PTSD. Chelsea's family were keen to explore a diagnosis of autism however despite there not being a fixed diagnosis for Chelsea this was not explored by the treating team and Chelsea's diagnosis of PTSD does not appear to have been routinely reviewed through her admission. To be clear; I mean that her diagnosis was not reviewed, not that her treatment and plans were not reviewed. There also seems to have been a move away from a diagnosis of an eating disorder and following the inquest I am not clear that I understand the rationale for this other than PTSD appeared to be a better 'fit' for Chelsea's symptoms. Ligatures Chelsea started to use ligatures in Cygnet having not done so previously. Again, this does not appear to have been a cause of significant concern and appears to be the norm within Chelsea's peer cohort. There was one particular issue for Chelsea however which came to light during the inquest which was that male members of staff felt concerned about interacting with Chelsea alone: even where that delayed support in risky situations. Engagement with Chelsea's Family I heard evidence that there came a time when Chelsea did not which for her parents to be aware of what was happening in Cygnet or have any information about her health and that she had capacity to make this decision. I have subsequently received the Capacity Assessment that supports this view. I also heard in evidence that the Capacity Assessment ought to have been revisited and that there were circumstances when a patient's wishes could not be respected. This was particularly relevant to Chelsea's mother having limited information and then supporting her on s17 leave. I also heard that Chelsea was supported by a legal advisor for the purposes of her detention under the Mental Health Act. I also heard no evidence that her age was considered and whether or not she was competent to make this decision even if she had capacity. Chelsea was 17 at the time of her death; this required careful exploration with her and there was no evidence of this. Emergency Response on the Day of the Final Ligature Incident I heard evidence that the check on Chelsea was delayed due to another emergency on the unit, namely the tying of a ligature by another individual. I also heard evidence that the timing of Chelsea's checks were not in accordance with recognised policy and ought perhaps to have prompted a different review and approval process (although the timings were appropriate and designed to keep Chelsea safe). I heard evidence, and the jury expressly accepted, that the alarm being pulled for the other patient using a ligature would be heard by Chelsea and was a relevant factor in her ligature event. I then heard that when she was checked the member of staff who checked on her would not lay hands on her as he was a male member of staff alone in the room and was worried about repercussions. He therefore sought support from a female member of staff who went to check on Chelsea and realised that she was not conscious. She then shouted for help and a ligature knife. There were then further delays as others came to observe Chelsea, collected the ligature knife, and removed the ligature then commenced CPR with the red bag. The jury found that these delays were unreasonable in the circumstances. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence about the co-ordination of CPR was that every member of staff present believed one individual was leading the CPR response; however, that particular individual was not aware of that. Whilst this did not materially change the CPR in this case it was certainly not indicative of a well- 3 rehearsed and practiced response to an emergency situation. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: – 1. The diagnosis whilst described as not being fixed; was not adequately reviewed. The primary witness for Cygnet in relation to diagnosis lacked professional curiosity even when asked questions in evidence. For example dismissing the potential that Chelsea may be hyperbolic in some of her descriptions of incidents and could that be relevant to diagnosis or treatment; evidence from the family about another member of the family with an autism diagnosis was not followed up (the evidence from Cygnet being that they had not been aware the family wished to explore this); nonetheless in evidence it was dismissed as a possibility. 2. Whilst it is important that the young person is believed and has confidence in those with a therapeutic relationship that she will be believed when she makes disclosures; there was almost no professional curiosity about the allegations and whether they spoke to something else going on with Chelsea. The allegations that were made were blindly accepted by the team and one example where this was problematic is that part of Chelsea's PTSD diagnosis was based on flashbacks. One of the flashbacks which she described related to finding her aunt dead. Her Aunt was not dead and in fact attended the inquest proceedings however this had not been clarified with the family and the treating team accepted this information from Chelsea unequivocally. It is clear there is a very fine balance to tread as it is clear that Chelsea was suffering from flashbacks and had suffered trauma, there was no demonstrable exploration of this. 3. The decision not to share information with family was made based on one capacity assessment. This did not fully address the issues with Chelsea of understanding the consequences of that decision and neither does it adequately break down the information which Cygnet may wish to share with family. This appears to have been a blanket decision and once a capacity assessment determined that Chelsea had the capacity to make that decision there is not evidence available to me of conversations with Chelsea to establish exactly what she would and would not share with family and that the consequences of those decisions were adequately explored with her. I would have expected; at Chelsea's age, that a social worker would be involved in supporting her with this decision and reviewing it regularly. This decision about her capacity and information sharing were also not revisited which they ought to have been regularly. Not least because Chelsea's mother was responsible for supporting her with s17 leave and was entitled to fully understand the risks to Chelsea or herself through this. 4. There was no evidence of debrief after prior incidents of ligatures or other self- harm attempts and therefore crucial information about Chelsea's state of mind, motivation and methods was missing from future planning and risk assessments. 5. There was limited concern about the number of ligature incidents collectively across the ward. They appear to have been accepted as normal behaviour. There was no record of Chelsea using ligatures prior to her admission onto this ward. This reality for staff appears to have led to a downgrading of the seriousness of the use of ligatures. With staff describing in evidence when they would and would not intervene and what would and would not constitute a serious incident in relation to ligatures (i.e., a hospital admission would be required before it was regarded as a serious incident requiring immediate changes to risk levels and observations). It may be that this approach to ligatures also contributed to the delay in Chelsea's final ligature being removed. 4 6. Male staff were nervous and uncertain of how to approach Chelsea when they were alone. Clear guidance needed to be made available to them on how to deal with this. Although in evidence staff said that if there was an emergency they would attend even if alone this was not the case in practice as the male member of staff sought female support before recognising that Chelsea was in crisis. 7. The approach of three members of staff checking Chelsea before the ligature knife was brought and used led to avoidable delay. I am aware from the evidence that there are practice exercises involving the 'Red Bag' however I am not clear that the same is practised in relation to the check, identification of a ligature and obtaining and using the ligature knife in these situations. 8. Whilst in evidence I have heard about the practice exercises using the 'Red Bag' it is clear that there was limited confidence and clarity around the CPR needed for Chelsea. There was not a clear structure of one person leading and others knowing exactly what and how to do tasks. 9. There were opportunities for commissioners to support Cygnet earlier when case managing Chelsea's package of care. The new behaviour of using ligatures should have invited professional curiosity from Commissioners who should have sought assurance about the overall practice of ligature use and intervention from Cygnet but also what that meant specifically for Chelsea and how Cygnet were keeping her safe. This may have led to a review by Cygnet and a better understanding of Chelsea's ligature use. 10. Commissioners also ought to have spoken to Chelsea themselves and assured themselves about the decision not to share information with her family; particularly her mother who had been a huge support for Chelsea prior to Covid- 19. The impact of the cessation of face-to-face visits on anyone detained under the mental health act, but particularly young people like Chelsea appears to have been underestimated. 6"

Lily was 17 years old when she passed away on the 1st June 2019. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 9th August 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion: 1 Lily Girton took her own life whilst suffering from a mental illness. Her death was contributed to by a failure of the community CAMHS team to expedite an assessment by a psychiatrist; to carefully and robustly assess and manage her risk to self and by a failure to titrate up her anti-depressant medication to an effective dose. 4,"Lily Girton suffered from anxiety, depression and emotional dysregulation . She sought assistance from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in December 2018. She was asked to register with a new GP before she could access the service. On 12 March 2019 she was seen for her first assessment with the team . Later the same day, Lily presented in distress at Euston station and required detention under section 136 of the MHA for her own safety. She was taken to University College Hospital where she was admitted to a paediatric ward and where she received care from the psychiatric liaison team . Following this brief admission , Lily was prescribed antidepressants by her GP who expected the community CAMHS team to continue monitoring and prescribing this medication . The community team did not do this and Lily was not seen by a psychiatrist within the community CAMHS Team . Lily was seen by a social worker within the CAM HS team , who had been appointed as her care co-ordinator. The care co­ ordinator provided cognitive behavioural therapy . She did not take steps to expedite the psychiatric appointment; did not take steps to ensure that Lily's medication was appropriately titrated and did not carefully assess, document and communicate Lily's risk to self. On the 29 April 2019, Lily was admitted to University Hospital again , requiring a longer admission and presenting with higher risk. The concerns of the hospital team were communicated to the community CAMHS teams, but Lily's care plan was not materially altered. On the 31 May 2019, Lily was involved in an altercation with a group of males in a kebab shop. She was mocked by the males and she reported that one of the males had hit her. In the early hours of the 1 June 2019, Lily was discovered partner's home address. Her life was pronounced extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. The altercation in the kebab shop is likely to have contributed to a decline in Lily's mental state on the 31 May 2019. The failings in the care provided to her by the community CAM HS team left Lily without the resilience to manage the decline in her mental state. 5 CORONE~SCONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern . In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken . In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you . The MATTERS OF CONCERN are",". - The Inquest heard that CAMHS services nationally have a lack of adequate staffing levels in the form of doctors, in the form of psychiatrists, registered mental health nurses and psychotherapy staff. The Inquest heard that consultants often have an average of 130 to 150 active cases on their caseloads . This is substantially higher than the recommended caseloads by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The lack of staffing and resources contributed to Lily's death and there is a concern that the ongoing shortages of suitably trained staff within CAM HS teams poses a risk of future deaths of young people. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 June 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Robyn took her own life whilst struggling with her mental health. The mental health services failed Robyn as they did not recognise the deterioration of her mental health nor provide her with the care and treatment she required. Her death was contributed to by neglect. 4,"On 7th May 2021 Robyn Skilton was found in Southwater Park, having tied a ligature around her neck. Emergency services were called but death was confirmed at 1251 hrs. Robyn had a history of mental health problems which included self harming. Despite her deteriorating mental health, at the time of her death, she was still awaiting a formal assessment by a Child Psychiatrist. 5","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Robyn was failed by the Mental Health Services quite frankly due to the current lack of resourcing and provision in place to support young people struggling with their mental health. Due to the lack of availability of a Child Psychiatrist there are long waiting times for children to be assessed. Robyn was not seen by a Child Psychiatrist and/or Psychologist, despite there being a need for this to happen, thereby enabling her to be diagnosed and receive a treatment plan. Robyn's parents did everything they could during this period to support Robyn, including paying for a private counsellor, but sadly Robyn's mental health continued to deteriorate during this time, and she took her own life. Robyn initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) similarly did not happen in a timely manner. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 I do appreciate that the landscape that the local mental health Trust (Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust) was working under and the fact that Covid heightened the level of complexity across many services but there were many failings in the care provided to Robyn. It became very clear during the Inquest that there is significant under funding of the local mental health Trust who like many mental health Trusts have seen an explosion of referrals to their Children and Mental Health services (CAMHS). By way of an example:- Referrals to West Sussex CAMHS have increased by 95.6% from May 2019 (389) to May 2022 (761) West Sussex CAMHS caseload has increased by 85% from May 2019 (2239) to May 2022 (4147) West Sussex CAMHS Duty caseload has increased by 112% from May 2021 (492) to May 2022 (1494) Mental Health A&E presentations, in period April 2021 - March 2022, have increased by 40% on previous year (April 2020 - March 2021). Additionally, across Sussex CAMHS, as a whole, the referrals data shows:- • May 2022 was the highest number of referrals the service has ever received (1350). • Of those 1350 referrals, 80% (1,081) were accepted into the service. • In comparison, in May 2019, 579 were accepted (65% accepted) • So, an additional 502 young people have been accepted in May 2022 compared to May 2019 Despite the increase in numbers accessing CAMHS there has not been any relative increase in resources to meet this demand and therefore the current position is is unsustainable and it is putting many young people's lives at risk. 6"

The medical cause of death was recorded as : 1a) Polytrauma The conclusion was a narrative conclusion - Died as a result of catastrophic injuries sustained after he jumped from the at the Rock centre in Bury. There was no evidence of his intention and he had a history of psychosis.,"4 Stanislav was 17 years old when he died on the 3rd February 2022. In concerns had been raised about his mental health and he was admitted as an inpatient. He was diagnosed with acute on-set psychosis. He was discharged from hospital in May 2020 and his care was passed to the Early Intervention team. Stanislav presented as a high risk to others. He travelled to Slovakia with his family in September 2020 and he returned in January 2021 . At this time there had been a clear deterioration in his mental health. There are repeated attempts to engage him and referrals for a mental health act assessment. On the 22nd January the court heard that a mental health act assessment was attempted at the home address. In attendance was a Section 12 approved independent psychiatrist, a Consultant Psychiatrist from the treating trust, the Approved Mental Health Practitioner and a professional who was involved in sourcing a bed for Stanislav. All members of this group gave evidence to the court as to what they understood had occurred on this day. There was a difference in opinion as to whether :­ a) A mental health act assessment had been conducted. The psychiatrists were of the opinion due to the brevity of time in which Stanislav was observed, merely walking past them into the house, an assessment was not done. This was at odds with the AMP who believed an assessment had been conducted. b) The next steps which were to be taken. Three of the professionals understood an application to the Magistrates court for a Section 135 warrant to allow entry into the property. This was not the understanding of the AMP who did not progress this action, having formed the opinion an assessment had in fact taken place. The Court heard evidence the Psychiatrists were expecting a further attempt to conduct an assessment later that day or the next day. On the 26th January 2021 Stanislav's treating Consultant Psychiatrist became aware of the outcome of the mental health act assessment. Due to ongoing concerns in relation to Stanislavs mental health a further mental health act assessment was arranged for the 3rd February 2021 . Stanislav jumoed of the 3rd February 2021. 5 CORONE~SCONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are",:­ 1. The Independent Section 12 Consultant Psychiatrist did not make and the court heard does not have the facilities to make any notes in relation to the assessment. 2. Following the assessment on the 22nd January 2021 there was no documented agreement as to the outcome of the assessment between all professionals. This would have negated the confusion and lack of understanding as to what had occurred and the actions required. 3. 6

The investigation concluded on the 17th June 2022. The Conclusion of the inquest was: ACCIDENT as part of a narrative Conclusion 4,"Shona had suffered psychological trauma as a child and had been treated by mental health services since the age of about 8. By the age of 18 Shona had an established diagnosis of a severe emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) together with emotional dysregulation and was at high risk of impulsive behaviour that could lead to serious injury or death. She had a long history of self-harming but cutting herself with sharp objects and had multiple scars on her body. Shona was transferred to Tesito House psychiatric unit (“Tesito”) from an acute psychiatric unit on the 22nd January 2018. Tesito was operated by Alternative Futures Group (“AFG”). This is a not-for-profit Charitable organisation that operates several psychiatric units. Tesito was a 24 bed unit in Ardwick , Manchester to treat and support women with complex needs which opened in 2017 but only cared for 8 patients. Services were provided in partnership with Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (“GMMH”) Shona was a patient of GMMH and was detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. This meant she was suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which made it appropriate for her to be detained in hospital in the interests of their own health and safety or the protection of others and that there was appropriate treatment available to her which could not be given unless she was detained in hospital. That remained her legal status. Her Responsible Clinician (“RC”) was a GMMH Consultant Psychiatrist assisted by a locum junior Psychiatric doctor who worked on weekdays. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings and ward rounds occurred frequently but sometimes were not attended by her named nurse and nor were the records of these kept appropriately updated and/or reviewed. At Tesito she was treated with antipsychotic medication, mood stabiliser drugs and antidepressants together with psychological therapies. Shona said that she heard voices of a persecutory and a derogatory/negative nature as well as having visual hallucinations. These were not assessed to be genuine psychotic symptoms but represented intrusive thoughts when she became distressed. However, even if they were not psychotic related auditory hallucinations, she could still act upon them. There were numerous incidents 3 on repeated occasions particularly when she was emotionally distressed and/or when she acted impulsively. . Whilst on section 17 leave from the unit she had absconded on more than one occasion and also took overdoses of paracetamol for which she required hospital treatment. During one of the hospital admissions she was able to cut her neck she had kept from a previous home visit. Her mood and condition was very variable and she could change from being happy and stable to becoming distressed and self-harming extremely quickly. Sometimes she said that this arose out of frustration and that at other times because she wanted to kill herself. The last formal risk written management plan was prepared on 16 October 2018 but was not regularly updated prior to her death. Her overall management was dealt with at MDT/ward rounds. After a period of Christmas home leave on 25 December 2018 she returned to the ward intoxicated and expressing suicidal ideas . There were seven further incidents of her using ligatures between the 28th and 31st of December and ligature cutters had to be used to remove them. On the 31 December she described hearing voices telling her to end her own life. There were further incidents of headbanging and on the 1 January 2019 during another incident of head banging she threatened to hit a member of staff who had attempted to remove items from her room in order to ensure her safety given the risk of self-harm. Shona's ability to repeatedly access forms of ligature was said to be a matter of concern but there was no clinical management plan formulated to address the risk that this posed and investigate how this was occurring. she was obviously cyanotic and suffering from asphyxia. Ligature cutters were used to remove the ligature. On the morning of 8 January, she was found to have ligatured again and resisted staff who try to remove it. She ligatured it again within an hour and then once more in the afternoon. At the MDT/ward round on 9 January her condition was noted to have improved and for the next couple of days she was stable but was still regarded as being at high risk of self-harm or suicide and was on 15-minute observations. The nursing staff had the discretion in the exercise of their clinical judgment to take such action as they thought were appropriate to protect her life. During the early evening of 11 January, she was noted to be in happy and stable mood. At about 03:15 hours on 12 January she was found in the bathroom of her room with a ligature . This was removed by the use of ligature cutters although Shona resisted attempts to do this. She declined PRN medication and was preoccupied by using her phone but did not appear to be distressed. The nurse in charge decided not to put her on one-to-one constant observations but on random nature for shorter periods of time. She also decided not to search her room. Although the nurse in charge had last worked shortly before Christmas, she was aware of Shona's general history of self- harming behaviour and that she had also read and was aware of the records relating to the incidents that happened at the end of December 2018 and also on the 1, 7 and 8 of January 2019. She was also aware that the use of ligatures by Shona could be fatal. At about 04:23 hours she was found in her room just inside the door in a state of cardiac arrest with another ligature Staff removed the ligature and began CPR was although a defibrillator was brought to her room it was not used but it was not explained why. About 10 minutes later paramedics arrived and took over the resuscitation. There was a return of spontaneous circulation, but it was not necessary for them to use their defibrillator. 4 She was taken to the Manchester Royal infirmary where despite treatment her condition deteriorated, and she died on 14 February. She died as a consequence of asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation After Shona was found in a state of cardiac arrest on 12 January some staff made retrospective clinical records which began at 05:35 hours. A support worker recorded that another support worker had been told by Shona that she was planning to ligature during the night but no contemporaneous clinical records were made of this. Neither of them could specifically recall telling the nurse in charge. The nurse in charge countersigned this record and agreed that she must have read the clinical note. Further clinical records were made and timed at 06:00 hours by the nurse in charge and she made no reference to this issue. She subsequently made her manuscript statement and a police statement but did not make any reference about the support worker recording that Shona had told them that she was planning to ligature and that she was unaware of this. No record was made after Shona was found to have used to ligature at about 03.15 hours or that the nurse in charge asked her whether or not she had another ligature and Shona had denied doing so. Although there were meant to be four observations an hour performed there were missing observations and, on some occasions, other members of staff were asked to do the observations but that was not recorded. The nurse in charge was unaware of this. Consequently, the records were not complete or accurate. It was also established that the women on the unit would swap or acquire objects to harm themselves including ligatures and this was known by the staff. A company called “Safety Matters” was commissioned by AFG to undertake a serious incident investigation and produce a report examining the circumstances surrounding her care and treatment as well as the appropriateness of the service provided. In addition to identify any root causes or contributory factors and make recommendations to reduce the likelihood of re-occurrence. The author said in the report that he had undertaken many reviews of services, staffing models, suicides and homicides including root cause analysis. One of the authors agreed that it was not a full and thorough report because there were other documents and information, he would have liked to obtain but did not or did not think they were relevant. He was unaware that any members of staff had made manuscript witness statements shortly after the events. Nor did he ask for any staff member to prepare a statement during the course of his investigation. Although he was aware that there was a police as well as a coronial investigation he did not think it relevant to ask whether or not any evidence or witness statements could be disclosed to him. The report did not consider whether the observation records were accurate and if not why or how they were undertaken in practice. The investigation was concluded without knowing the pathological medical cause of death, but on the basis that Shona had died as a result of the use of ligature. The clinical and other staff involved were interviewed and written records of those interviews were kept but there was not a consistent method of ensuring that those interviewed agreed with the records or wished to amend and correct them. However, important issues were not investigated. The support workers were not asked about what was or what was not recorded in the clinical notes concerning Shona saying she was planning to ligature and whether or not they told anyone else and if so who and when and why no clinical records were made of it. The nurse in charge was not asked whether or not she was aware of this and, if so, what she did about it or her clinical rationale for her decisions. Nor was she asked why she had not made any reference to it in her own retrospective clinical records if she was unaware of this important clinical information. The nurse was recorded as saying that “Policy seems to be let people have ligatures to take responsibility even if they have to be cut off many times during the day.” This was not further investigated with AFG. 5 The Care Quality Commission (“CQC”) carried out an inspection of the Service on 6th and 7th March 2018 and published a report dated 24th July 2018. Having reviewed the records of all eight patients at the Service, the CQC found that not all patients had written risk assessments. Those risk assessments that were in place were poorly written and individual risks to the patients and others were not sufficiently mitigated. In five care records, although risk assessments were present, they were not comprehensive. Risk management plans lacked detail and, where a level of risk was identified for one patient, there was no evidence of review or updates of the assessment. Following incidents, risk management plans were not updated. At the time of the inspection the staffing establishment levels were below those identified for the Service. This resulted in 50% of the shifts being filled by bank and agency staff. The Service did not have a robust process for identifying the required staffing levels, but the staff received appropriate training. Overall, the service was rated as Inadequate. The CQC carried out a further inspection of the Service on 13th December 2018 and published a report dated 27th February 2019. Overall, they found that that there had been improvements in patient risk assessments and their review as well as care plans. Lessons learned from incidents were not always being shared with staff at the Service. Mandatory training had not been completed by all eligible staff. Only half the qualified nurses had completed intermediate life support training. Staff did not receive all the training required to perform their roles prior to working with individuals. Staff did not have access to specialist training to work with high-risk patients. Staffing levels did not ensure that patients had a consistent level of support and access to activities. Systems processes and standard operating procedures were not reliable or appropriate to keep people safe. Overall, the service was still rated as Inadequate. AFG submitted an application to the CQC to cancel the registration for Tesito House on the 21 February 2019 and CQC removed the location from being a registered service provider on the 28 February 2019.The unit was then closed. The CQC did not carry out an investigation themselves after Shona died because Tesito House had been de-registered and closed although they could have done because she was a detained mental health patient. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The lack of appropriate contemporaneous clinical record keeping by the nurse in charge as well as other nurses. 6 2. The lack of appropriate contemporaneous clinical record keeping by the Support Workers. 3. Patient observations were not being completed as directed and accurate records were not being kept. 4. There was inadequate communication between the Nurse in Charge and Support Workers about important clinical information relating to self-harm as well as completion of observations and the records. 5. That patients could obtain ligatures and other objects that could be used for self- harm/suicide and/or used against other patients and staff members. 6. Regular training on all the applicable policies/procedures and use of an Automated Electronic Defibrillator. 7. Completion and updating of all care plans including risk assessments after MDT meetings/Ward rounds as well as an auditing process. 8. The need for appropriate clinical supervision of nurses and support workers. 9. The lack of a clear clinical assessment and plan to investigate and deal with repeated self-harm attempts that could result in serious injury or death as well as the repeated access to and use of ligatures. 10. The opportunities missed by the Safety Matters Ltd Serious Incident Investigation report process to obtain other relevant information and/or make additional enquiries which could affect the overall findings and recommendations for learning, improving practice and procedure as well as patient safety. This will also help improve other investigations that the authors of the report may do in the future. 6"

Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust 2. Cambridgeshire County Council 1,"On 8 April 2020 the coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Daniel France, age 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 January 2022. Danny was 17 years old and was living at a YMCA hostel. He was on medication for depression and had been referred to secondary mental health services. He had made previous suicide attempts. On 3 April 2020 he of his accommodation with the intention of taking his own life. The medical cause of death was asphyxiation by hanging and the conclusion was suicide. 4","Danny was a vulnerable teenager: he had left home and was living in hostel accommodation; he had changed his GP practice; he was trans, had changed his name and had been referred to the Gender Identity Clinic; he had recently been discharged from secondary mental health services in Suffolk and had been referred to mental health services in Cambridge; he had previously been under CAMHS and was now being referred to adult mental health services; he had diagnoses of anxiety and depression and had been prescribed medication; he had made previous suicide attempts and had long term suicidal thoughts; he had sought counselling from IAPT but this was declined because he was considered too high risk; he had been assessed by First Response Service but had been considered as not requiring urgent intervention. Safeguarding referrals about Danny were made to Cambridgeshire County Council in October 2019 and January 2020. Both referrals were closed and it was accepted that the decision to close both referrals was incorrect. In December 2019 Danny's new GP referred him to Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT). He had been seen by the Primary Care Mental Health Services but was still awaiting assessment by the Adult Locality Team at the time of his death. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – My concern in this case is that a vulnerable young person can be known to the County Council and Mental Health Trust and yet not receive the support they need pending substantive treatment. Danny was repeatedly assessed as not meeting the criteria for urgent intervention and yet the waiting list for psychological therapy was likely to be over a year from point of first presentation. That gap between urgent and non-urgent services is potentially dangerous for a vulnerable young person, where there is a chronic risk of an impulsive act. I understand that there is a long term plan to extend young people's services to age 25, but I remain concerned about the ongoing situation, and that a young person today could be faced with the same challenges in finding support pending substantive treatment. I believe this concern is the combined responsibility of Cambridgeshire County Council and CPFT. These organisations may wish to consult in preparing their response to this report. The inquest heard evidence about the considerable delay in obtaining appointments for the Gender Identity Clinic, and about the shortage of availability for psychological therapies such as CBT. These are matters for policy and funding. This report will therefore be copied to NHS England and The Secretary of State for Health for information purposes only. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 January 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows Medical cause of death: 1(a) Hanging The four questions - who, when, where and how – were answered as follows: Jake Adam CAHILL died on 14 September 2020 at Cornwall by being an impulsive act in a moment of crisis, that was wholly unexpected and could not have been anticipated. Short form conclusion: Suicide 4","Jake had been subject to police investigations for a minor criminal offence committed in March 2020. The police issued a conditional caution which was administered on 4 September 2020. Jake was clearly upset at being issued with a police caution and having conditions imposed. Subsequently the local youth 2 Information Classification: CONTROLLED offender service (YOS) sent Jake's mother, , some documents for completion. This included a self-assessment form, being a document produced by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales. The letter from the YOS instructed to pass that self-assessment form to Jake for completion. handed this form to Jake late in the evening of 13 September. The form was written in the first person and three questions were highlighted at Inquest, with a yes/no box for completion • I have thought about hurting myself • I have tried to hurt myself • I have thought about killing myself Jake ticked 'no' for each of these questions. The following day Jake took his own life. In connection with the self-assessment form there was no evidence of any consideration being given to the need for sensitive questions raised in the form to be discussed with Jake by a professional before Jake completed the form. Evidence was taken from police on the subject of the risk assessment forms used by police. These forms do include questions whether an individual intends to harm or kill themselves. This form is never sent to individuals but is always completed by the individual with an officer present, that officer being required to explain and if necessary, contextualise the questions. The court heard that the guidance to the self-assessment form issued by the Youth Justice Board makes no express reference to the need for consideration to be given and documented as to whether the self-assessment form needs to be discussed with a vulnerable young person before completion of the form. The guidance examined at the Inquest was a document entitled 'AssetPlus guidance v2.0'. Jake had no history of any mental health conditions, or any history of self-harm or suicidal ideation. There was no evidence from friends and family of any warning sign as to Jake's state of mind. Toxicological examination was negative, in other words no drugs or alcohol were found in samples of blood taken from Jake after death. The police investigation had searched through Jake's browsing history. That enquiry revealed nothing of concern until the day of Jake's death 14 September 2020, by way of image caches captured on his browsing history",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) that there was no evidence of any consideration being given to the need for sensitive issues raised in the self-assessment form to be discussed with Jake by a professional before Jake completed the form. (2) that the guidance to the self-assessment form issued by the Youth Justice Board makes no express reference to the need for consideration to be given and documented as to whether the form should be discussed with a vulnerable young person before completion. 6

The inquest concluded on the 10th September 2021 when I found that the medical cause of death was - Ia Multiple Traumatic Injuries and my conclusion as to the death was that - Oskar Nash died as a result of Suicide contributed to by neglect on the part of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. Oskar Nash's death was more than minimally contributed to by the failures of : (i) Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service : To undertake a clinical assessment of Oskar's mental and emotional health at any stage, despite a series of requests for them to do so, and a consequential failure to diagnose, treat, monitor and otherwise support Oskar as necessary, in order to minimise his risk of suicide. (ii) Surrey County Council's Special Educational Needs Department : (a) To ensure that Oskar's Educational, Health and Care Plan contained sufficient and updated information about his mental and emotional health needs and his risk of suicidal ideation, and the provision required to meet those needs, and (b) To place Oskar in an appropriate school, rather than in March 2019 his inappropriate placement in a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs. (iii) Surrey County Council's Children's Services Department and Targeted Youth Support Team : (a) To complete the required assessments following Oskar's referral in November 2019, and to provide any effective intervention or support, and (b) To reallocate the management of his case to a Registered Social Worker following escalation of Oskar's risk level in the course of November 2019. (iv) St. Dominic's School and Cobham Free School : To ensure that there was a sufficient sharing of information about Oskar's history, special needs and current situation, prior to his transfer from a special needs school to a mainstream school in March 2019. I subsequently held a hearing to receive evidence relating to the prevention of future deaths and this was concluded on the 7th December 2021, with time allowed subsequently for written submissions. 4","Oskar Nash was 14 years old when he died. He had been diagnosed with autism at the age of 4 years and he suffered associated high anxiety throughout his life. It is likely that he also had one or more undiagnosed emotional or mental health condition(s). Oskar had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both of which receded when his needs were sufficiently supported. Oskar was well known to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service and to Children's Services, having been the subject of a number of referrals to both. His education was managed by the Special Educational Needs Department of his local authority as he had been issued with an Educational, Health and Care Plan. All state agencies concerned with Oskar had knowledge of his history of suicidal ideation. In March 2019 Oskar transferred from a special needs school to a mainstream school. Initially he appeared to cope, but from early November 2019 onwards, he regularly refused to attend school and a period of escalating risk followed. Referrals were made to CAMHS and Children's Services but Oskar did not receive any effective support. On the 9th January 2020, Oskar Nash gained access to an area of and, a short time later, at about 17.06 hours, he deliberately moved . His body was found the following morning. Full details of the events and failings which lead to Oskar Nash's death are set out in my “Factual Findings and Conclusions” document, a copy of which is sent with this report. 5","The evidence heard at the inquest revealed many matters giving rise to concern. The evidence received at the prevention of future deaths hearing showed that many of those concerns have been addressed. However, in my opinion the following concerns remain and give rise to a continuing risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows : A. Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Concern 1 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff responsible for the triage of referrals to child mental health services had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I have been told that the triaging process is now undertaken by an “Access and Advice Team” but I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff in that Team to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 2 The evidence at the inquest revealed that, despite a series of referrals to child mental health services over many years, Oskar Nash never received the clinical assessment he needed. I have been told that the system now in place ought to result in a child such as Oskar being seen and assessed by a clinical team. I am satisfied that the introduction of the Access and Advice Team, in the context of the new Mindworks service, is intended to ensure that a referred child's needs are properly identified and met. However, on the basis of the evidence I heard at the prevention of future deaths hearing, including from a special needs school which has experience of referring its pupils, I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that some referrals may be inappropriately closed (for example because the child, at an early stage, declines to engage) or inappropriately referred to non-clinical partner agencies. In this context, I am concerned that there is a lack of specific monitoring of what proportion of referred children reach a clinical team and the extent to which the outcomes match the expectations of the referrers (so that any ongoing “barriers” in the system, which may be preventing proper access to the clinical teams, can then be identified and eliminated). Concern 3 The evidence showed that a referral to the child mental health services is triaged initially as being crisis, urgent, priority or routine. The criteria for crisis, urgent and priority referrals are specific and narrow and, consequently, the great majority of referrals are categorised as routine. I have been told that the routine referrals are automatically categorised as “low risk”. I am concerned about this as it is clear from the evidence that a child may not meet the criteria crisis, urgent or priority but, like Oskar Nash, may nevertheless be at a high or medium risk of harm. The Trust is currently receiving a high volume of referrals and so there is a considerable waiting time for its “routine” cases to be addressed. It seems inevitable, therefore, that there are children in this category who have been wrongly assumed to be at low risk of harm but who, in fact, face a high risk of harm which is currently unrecognised and unmanaged. Concern 4 I was told that the Standard Operating Procedure manual for the triage of referrals to children's mental health services is to be updated to reflect the Trust's new working practices but that this has not yet been done. I am concerned that important changes to the system of work (for example, the vital requirement that a referred child's records are reviewed before any triaging decision is made and the child/family are spoken to) are not yet established in written guidance. Concern 5 The evidence at the inquest showed that the clinicians who were responsible for ensuring that Oskar Nash's medical conditions, including his risk of self-harm and suicide, and his consequential needs, were properly and sufficiently recorded in his Education, Health and Care Plan, failed to do so; this was in part because they did not fully understand their role and obligations in this regard. On the basis of the evidence at the prevention of future deaths hearing, I am concerned that there continues to be a lack of understanding amongst the clinicians currently providing medical advice as part of the EHCP process as to their role in that process. I am further concerned that there is in place no programme for the training or monitoring of these clinicians in relation to these responsibilities. B. Surrey County Council (and National) (i) Education and Special Educational Needs Department Concern 6 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in the Education / SEN Department, including SEN caseworkers, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 7 The evidence at the inquest showed that, in the months before his death, Oskar Nash was moved from a special needs school and placed into a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs. I found that the inappropriate placement, by SCC, of Oskar into the mainstream school contributed to his death. Prior to the placement, the mainstream school had been provided with Oskar's Educational, Health and Care Plan, but this failed adequately to identify and record his mental and emotional health concerns, his risk of suicidal ideation, his consequential needs, and the provision required to meet those needs, and it had not been updated to reflect a series of subsequent reviews of the Plan and significant subsequent events. The mainstream school was not provided with any of the extensive and informative records from the special needs school from which he was being moved. I was told by the mainstream school that, had they seen the records held by his special needs school, they would have recognised their inability to meet his needs and informed the SEN Department accordingly. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that it continues to be the case that a prospective school will usually be provided by the SEN Department with the child's EHCP only. Further, it was apparent that there is a lack of clarity as to the extent to which a current school may or should provide records or information to a prospective school. I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that placements of children with EHCPs are being made on the basis of inadequate information and record sharing. On the evidence before me, it was clear that, even if an EHCP were comprehensive and fully updated (which may not be the case), it is unlikely to contain all matters of relevance to the question of a prospective school's ability to meet the child's needs. I was given no good reason why fuller information and record sharing, sufficient to ensure that the prospective school can properly assess its ability to meet the child's needs, should not take place before any child with an EHCP is placed in a new school. I am concerned that there is no system in place, locally or nationally, to ensure this is achieved by the relevant SEN department for every child with an EHCP. I am also concerned that there is an ongoing lack of clarity as to schools' powers and duties to share information and documents, and any data protection ramifications this may have. (ii) Children's Services Department Concern 8 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in SCC's Children's Services Department, including Social Workers and other Team members, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self- harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 9 At the inquest I found that following Oskar Nash's final referral to SCC's Children's Services Department, which was made approximately two months before his death, there was a failure to appreciate the seriousness of his situation and the risks arising, and a consequential failure to allocate his case appropriately. I found that this contributed to his death. The inappropriate allocation resulted, in part, from the application of SCC's then “threshold of needs” document, which was used to inform the level at which support should be provided. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence about SCC's revised “threshold of needs” document, as well as the recent guidance (including a “toolbox”) in relation to suicidality, which has been introduced since Oskar's death. Despite these changes, I remain concerned that the “threshold of needs” document does not adequately and clearly reflect the known risks of mental health difficulties, self-harm, and suicidal ideation for autistic children (given their prevalence in this group of children) and that, consequentially, there is an ongoing risk that an autistic child in these circumstances will be allocated an insufficient level of support, as was the case for Oskar. C. Surrey County Council and Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group (and National) Concern 10 At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence concerning the post- death reviews conducted into Oskar Nash's death by the Surrey Child Death Review Partnership Team and the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership. The evidence showed that neither process resulted in a sufficient or effective investigation of the death; I consider that the evidence shows that fact finding was superficial, there was no meaningful analysis of the part played by statutory agencies in the causation of his death, and only very limited learning was identified. Ineffective review by the child death review processes results in the risk of further deaths in similar circumstances and I am concerned that the local and/or national process, guidance and oversight are insufficient to ensure that an effective post- death investigation, which should not be dependent on the inquest process, is achieved in all cases. D. National Issues Concern 11 From the evidence I heard at the inquest and the prevention of future deaths hearing, it was apparent that the national “Working Together” guidance focuses on children who are in need of safeguarding by reason of risks within the home or from other parental failures to keep the child safe. It was apparent that the consequential approach tends to look critically at the child's family and parent(s) and their parenting skills, and that this is likely to be inappropriate if the child is in need through disability. I consider that this had a detrimental impact on the approach of agencies to Oskar and his family. I am concerned that “Working Together” does not provide clearer guidance specifically for the safeguarding of children with disabilities, including Autism, and the approach to be taken by agencies to parents and families. Concern 12 The evidence at the inquest revealed a widespread lack of knowledge and understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self- harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. There was a lack of training across all the state agencies from which I heard. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence of more training being available, but also of an ongoing absence of comprehensive, relevant and mandatory training. I was told that the National Autism Strategy does not currently include a timetabled commitment for relevant mandatory Autism training to be provided to all state agencies working directly with autistic adults and children. I am concerned that this poses an ongoing risk to autistic children and their ability to access the services they require for their support, welfare, and safeguarding. 6"

The Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I conducted on 17th – 28th January 2022. The conclusion was a narrative conclusion and the medical cause of death was 1a. Hanging. 2. Depression 4,"These were recorded as :- Manon Edie Jones, aged 16, suffered depression and emotional dysregulation. Her behaviour was impulsive and she had a significant history of self harm. Her mental health deteriorated from late February 2018 when she concealed an overdose and a knife. On 5th March 2018 she used a knife to cut herself and required to be disarmed by the police. She was admitted for the night to the University Hospital of Wales where she was subject to continuous observation for her safety and transferred to the Ty Llidiard Unit with 3 escorts. Her observation levels were reduced to 15 minute observations on the night of her arrival at Ty Llidiard and her admission to Enfys ward. The reasons for this were not recorded. Shortly after 21.10 on 7th March 2018 staff levels on the ward fell as staff left it to respond to an alarm. At 21.18 Manon was found by 2 staff She could not be revived. In light of her history of impulsive actions it could not be determined whether she intended to end her life. The narrative conclusion which I returned was: Manon Jones died from ligaturing while suffering a mental health episode in circumstances where she ought to have been subject to continuous 1:1 observation pending further assessment. The Inquest focused upon:- 1. The provision of community care in the week leading up to the admission 2. The adequacy of risk formulation upon and after admission 3. How that risk informed the care and treatment planning including levels of observation and the placement of Manon in a bedroom with ligature points 4. Staffing levels 5. The assessment and engagement of Manon while a patient at Ty Llidiard 6. The effectiveness of the resuscitation. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The clinicians assessing Manon on admission to Ty Llidiard did not have available to them the records of her care made in the community by the Crisis team, the Community Intensive Treatment team or the University Hospital of Wales (2) The Clinical records in the Ty Llidiard Unit were not all entered contemporaneously in a single clinical record (3) The absence of a single in and outpatient clinical record impaired the ability of the clinicans at the unit on admission to be able to assess Manon, fix a safe levels of observations, and safeguard her. 6"

MM was discovered a few hours later by a group of youths in a despite CPR an attending paramedic confirmed her death at 23 03 hours. She took her own life and a subsequent note found in her room at the Cove evidenced her intention to do so. In the Narrative conclusion failings at the Cove were identified in that :- 1. Formulation and risk management plans were not revisited when self-harm incidents occurred and did not include Mazie's needs and how they were to be met. 2. Her risk assessment held limited risk history and management plans in regard to Mazie's risk of going missing. 3. There was no written standardised procedure for agreeing and facilitating leave. 4. Communication of relevant information and record-keeping did not meet the required standard. 5. There were insufficient staff members with the 4 residents who were on leave. 4 5",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 November 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was that: On the 7th April 2021 Kaja Weronika Spiewak died after deliberately . She suffered from schizoaffective disorder and was under the care and treatment of mental health services. 4,"On the 7th April 2021 an onboard supervisor (OBS) for Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd noticed Kaja on Barnham Station at about 8.00am. The same OBS noticed Kaja boarding her train at Barnham station at 11.05am. Kaja got off at another station but the OBS was concerned about her welfare. The OBS invited Kaja to get back onto the train and then contacted the Govia Thameslink Railway control room raising her concerns about Kaja's vulnerability. The OBS did not report the concerns to the police and the Govia Thameslink Railway witnesses gave evidence that this would have been the recommended course of action. The Govia Thameslink Railway control room staff agreed that the OBS would hand Kaja over to the station staff at Havant train station. The control room staff then made contact with Brighton train station (as Kaja's reported destination), Havant station and conductors on a number of trains. After Kaja had left Havant station the control room staff were not able to ascertain where she had gone. By 12.04pm the control room Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 staff had been informed that Kaja was not on the expected train. No further actions were recorded as being taken by control room staff until 1.40pm. Kaja had actually arrived at Southbourne Station by 11.50am and remained on the platform until approximately 12.20pm. She then Kaja was declared deceased at 1.07pm. 5","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) I heard evidence from the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd that training on dealing with vulnerable persons was not mandatory for frontline staff. In fact only 583 out of 7,500 staff had attended a course run by the Samaritans entitled Managing Suicidal Contacts, 40% had completed some e-learning and an unknown number had completed an internal course. In addition refresher training on this issue was an aspiration only and had not been rolled out by Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd. I also heard evidence that the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd did not have any input into the training for their team based in the joint control room. I am therefore concerned that those members of staff most likely to have contact with vulnerable or suicidal persons, as well as those responsible for assisting frontline staff, are not all properly trained to deal with the situation in the best possible way. (2) I heard evidence that Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd staff control room staff relied upon a protocol entitled 'Person ill on a train' when a vulnerable person was reported to them. The witness responsible for the Govia Thameslink Railway control room team accepted that this was not an appropriate document to rely upon as it made no mention of vulnerable persons. I am therefore concerned that the control room staff do not have the appropriate information to assist their colleagues and to arrange an appropriate response when a 'concern for welfare' report is made to them. (3) I heard evidence that the Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not log all actions taken after the concern for welfare report. I am concerned that it is not possible to assess whether all reasonable and appropriate actions were taken by the control room staff and whether individuals or teams have further training needs. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 (4) The Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not contact British Transport Police, 999 nor share the information about this 'concern for welfare' report with Network Rail despite having a joint control room. I heard evidence that there was no written protocol covering when Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd staff should share a 'concern for welfare' report with Network Rail staff in the shared control room. I am concerned that there is not appropriate information sharing and reporting to other agencies, including British Transport Police, when a 'concern for welfare' is raised. 6"

The medical cause of death given was: 1a. Suspension I returned a conclusion of with Frankie's death more than minimally contributed to by the failures of: 1. Stepping Stone School: a. To provide an effective e-security system as tasked to do so by the department of Education. b. To ensure Frankie's use of the iPad was monitored to confirm her safety. c. To provide Frankie with supervision when not attending lessons despite having an Educational Health Care Plan in place. 2. : a. A lack of robustness in their policies to remove age inappropriate content that allowed Frankie to read stories on their platform on the day of her death featuring , an act which she goes on to complete herself. 4","Frances Rose Thomas (Frankie) was a vulnerable teenager with a number of significant underlying difficulties including childhood trauma, high functioning autism, oppositional behaviour and impulsivity. Stepping Stones School is a school for students with moderate physical or learning difficulties. Frankie was offered a place in year 8 and started in April 2016 with an Educational Care Plan in place. Throughout her time at the school Frankie often refused to attend lessons and at the time of her death rarely attended more than one lesson a week. When not attending lessons, she was left on her own without any formal supervision. During this time, she had access to a school computer and an iPad. During the Inquest I heard evidence Frankie only had access to the during school time using electronic devices supplied by the school. There was an e-security system in place for school computers but it was not monitored by nominated safeguarding leads. This allowed Frankie (as it did for all students) to freely access the without any observation as to what websites were being accessed and for an assessment to be made of their appropriateness. Furthermore, the iPads had no e-security system in place at all, again allowing Frankie to freely access the without any supervision. On the day of her death, Frankie was found to have accessed The stories that Frankie accessed on this platform featured . After school Frankie went home and undertakes a similar act resulting in her death on 25th September 2018. 5","1. I heard evidence that the Department of Education have devolved responsibility for e-security systems with schools having to 'tender' for web filtering software and hardware. However, the guidelines issued by the Department of Education require updating and are insufficiently robust to ensure their effectiveness and meet the changing demands of e-security in schools. 2. There is a wide range of software vendors providing different lists of blocklists with different vendors enabling different categories with no oversight or regulatory guidance by the Department of Education as to what 'blocklists' are either acceptable and/or suitable for a school environment. 3. is not a specifically blocked and not only can it be accessed by Key Stage 4 students there is encouragement to do so in some schools. However, I heard evidence that the sites Frankie accessed through . Furthermore, there is inadequate independent scrutiny by to remove age inappropriate stories put on their platform. 4. Some websites are only blocked when there is a particular key word in the URL If the relevant trigger word (e.g. ) is not there it makes it difficult for the filter to 'see' the content of the website to be able to block it, hence why stories on could be read. However, there are software systems available that acts as a 'key logger' and 'screen reader'. Whilst this will not block the site it will generate a report to the nominated safeguarding individual for further action.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

At Kesia's Inquest I heard that her place of residence, City Road in Winchester, was a residential housing unit for vulnerable young people aged 16-21. The facility meets a housing need only for the young persons placed there. It was found on the evidence that A2 Dominion employees did not have sufficient training or tools (i.e. implements) in place to prepare staff for the situation that they faced on the 20th January 2020 when they found Kesia hanging in her room, nor could they carry out any physical actions to assist her (i.e. cut her down). There appeared to be no prior appreciation of the risk(s) of self-harm, overdose or attempted suicide of residents, and so on discovering Kesia suspended in her room, the staff were inadequately prepared on multiple levels.
(a) I heard that whilst there has been additional training for the staff on areas of risk such as self-harm, overdose and/or suicide, there have been no physical changes in terms of the provision of tools and implements that staff could use should they be confronted by a young person in distress and/or in need of life-saving attention. It appears to me that without multi-factorial changes there remains a real and significant risk that staff at the residential units will remain unable to take any immediate and potentially life-saving action. The only tools and equipment that remain supplied is a standard home-style first aid kit which is entirely ineffective if a young person has suspended themselves from a ligature.
(b) Although additional training and courses have been added to both the induction training and on-going professional development of staff within the residential units similar to City Road, I remain concerned by the way in which key policies and training are communicated and implemented as this does not appear to have changed. It was clear from the evidence that updates to policies are emailed to employees with a request that the employee responds to the email to confirm receipt. This proved to be wholly ineffective as what appeared to be expected by the company was that the employee would read, digest and understand the policy, and confirm when he/she had done so. The employee on duty on the 20th January 2020 was clearly unfamiliar with the appropriate policies and had only confirmed that he had received the email (which appeared to be all that was required) and not that he had actually read, digested and understood the appropriate policy/ies; how to apply them in practice and what was reasonably expected of him. Although enhanced risk training is now place, it appears to me that without any enhanced diligence to ensure that policies are actually read and understood by those working face-to-face with the vulnerable young adults then the overall effectiveness of risk training and identification is severely flawed."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 May 2021. • The conclusion of the inquest was that Chris died by suicide when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train on 26 January 2019. • Box 3 of the record of inquest recorded that: “Chris was an informal patient at the Darwin Unit for Young People, Fulbourn, Cambridge. Shortly after 6.30 pm on Saturday 26 January 2019, she was permitted to leave the hospital for a cigarette break. She did not return to the unit as expected, but instead went to the nearby railway line. At about 7.35 pm Chris died when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train, approximately 150 metres to the east of the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing” • I gave a wider narrative conclusion together with factual findings delivered in open court. My narrative conclusion included that: “Given the proximity of the Darwin Unit (and also the Fulbourn Hospital) and previous trespass incidents involving vulnerable patients: (i) Network Rail had made available a suitable and valuable facility for direct communication between CPFT and the signallers to slow the trains. (ii) Network Rail's fencing between and around the Cherry Hinton Bypass and Teversham Level Crossings was less than optimal. However, it would be mere speculation to conclude that this contributed to Chris' death.” 4","My factual findings included that Chris may have accessed the railway line from the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing, from the Teversham Level Crossing or though or over the boundary fence between those level crossings. My factual findings further included that: 1) Network Rail had too readily assumed that Chris had accessed the railway via the Cherry Hinton Bypass Level Crossing. 2 2) Both BTP and Network Rail fell into error in promoting that from a credible hypothesis into a firm assumption. 3) Network Rail in written evidence had gone so far as to state that “Access was made by Ms Gould at the crossing not via boundary [fencing]”. There was no proper basis for such a firm assertion of Chris' route of access and this detracted from the otherwise careful evidence provided to the Court by Network Rail. 4) While compliant with standards, the fencing of the lower Class II type between the two level crossings near the Darwin Units should have been considered for upgrading given the proximity of the mental health units and the frequency of trespass incidents. 5) The boundary fencing at the time of Chris' death was less than optimal given the known risks. 6) It is to Network Rail's credit that they have now proactively decided to install 1.8m palisade fencing across the whole boundary area. 7) The annual inspections reporting the fencing as being in good condition did not appear to have captured the frequent cases of damage to the top line of the fencing. Such damage may not have rendered the fencing as in poor condition, but it pointed to trespassing incidents which ought to have been fed back into the risk assessments for the area. 8) In combination, the number of trespass incidents, and the frequent top-line level damage to the fencing should have led to the conclusion that the boundary measure was not preventing trespass. That should have led, but did not in fact lead, to the boundary fence being inspected every three months rather than annually. 9) I noted that Network Rail had already indicated in evidence that it would in future be inspecting the fence boundary every three months. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) Following completed suicides on the railway network BTP and Network Rail are both involved in considering further mitigating measures that may be appropriate at the location to guard against further fatalities. (2) In Chris' case, earlier consideration to the fence boundary being a credible route of access may have led to the fence boundary being improved more quickly after her death. (3) I am concerned that your investigation into, and consideration of, Chris' death did not keep a sufficiently open mind that she may have climbed the boundary fence to access the railway line. If similar assumptions are made in other investigations, there is a risk of future fatalities: there is a risk that mitigating measures will be missed if BTP and Network Rail too readily assume that one point of access to the railway was used when the evidence permits of credible alternative routes of access. Accordingly, I am concerned that"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 April 2021. An investigation commenced on 5 February 2019 into the death of Christine Elizabeth GOULD (Chris) aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 May 2021. These were separate inquests. • Sam died by suicide by an overdose of prescribed medication on 2 September 2018. • Chris died by suicide when she deliberately stepped in front of a passing train on 26 January 2019. The conclusion in relation to Sam's death was that the main cause of her death was her Borderline Personality Disorder, which treating clinicians assessed to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood. The conclusion in relation to Chris' death was that the main cause of her death was: (1) her serious mental health disorder (variously diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Mixed Disorder of Conduct and Emotions). Treating clinicians assessed this to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood; (2) The recent death by suicide of her sister Sam (who also suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder) similarly assessed by clinicians to be related to the allegations of their prolonged sexual abuse. In each case, there was a wider narrative conclusion and factual findings delivered in Open Court. Relevant to both CCC's and CPFT's involvement in Sam's death the narrative conclusion included that: “Following two very challenging school related incidents in February 2018, Sam's secondary school faced a difficult decision on whether to permit her to be educated on the main school site. Their decision making approach was unsatisfactory, 2 although they were entitled to be very concerned at the risks involved in Sam being taught on the main site. Communication and joint working between the school, the local authority and CAMHS was, in significant respects, ineffective. A degree of distress and disruption from the events in February 2018 was inevitable but the agencies did not sufficiently mitigate their impact.” Relevant to CCC's involvement in Sam's death, I detailed shortcomings in my factual findings regarding how both education and social care sides of the local authority dealt with Sam's needs. Relevant to CPFT's involvement in Chris' death, the narrative conclusion included that: “When a patient went missing, there was provision for CPFT to contact the train signallers direct in order to slow the local trains (this was provided for in a joint protocol with Network Rail). That step should have been, but was not, immediately taken when Chris failed to return. Had the trains been slowed, it is possible that Chris would not have died that night. This failure occurred because of a combination of factors: a. the particular risk of Chris going to the railway line was recognised but should have been better communicated and documented so that, if Chris went missing, it was immediately clear to all staff; b. the CPFT policy for missing (AWOL) patients was complex and had not been summarised into a shortened ready guide that could be used live during an incident; c. there was some confusion as to whether or not the CPFT AWOL policy had superseded the joint protocol with Network Rail which had permitted the signallers to be contacted directly; d. the AWOL policies were inadequately trained and then inadequately implemented on the night.” Also relevant to CPFT's involvement in Chris' death, I found that there was an inconsistency of approach in what was recorded as Chris' diagnosis. Having apparently settled on a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and Complex PTSD, I found that it was inappropriate for CPFT to keep reverting to a diagnosis of mixed disorder of conduct and emotions rather than continue to identify Border Personality Disorder (or EUPD) in the diagnosis. 4","In addition to the circumstances evident from the summary of the conclusions and findings set out above, when Sam and Chris were cared for at home (which was, during several periods, the best place for their risk of self-harm/suicide to be managed), the need for vigilance around the clock became extremely challenging for their parents. This involved not just physical supervision but a need for care over medication storage and access, and social media use. Although the First Response Service was available, the parents found that it did not offer sufficient support in practice and Chris' increasing aversion to the emergency services (caused by PTSD) meant that the use of ambulance and police responses was also highly problematic. The family's greatest need was for support in the overnight period, which was a need with which social care services and CPFT were not able, materially, to assist. 3 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) Overnight assistance for adolescent mental health patients being cared for at home but with high levels of need (For CPFT and CCC). I heard evidence of increased funding for CPFT being used to extend home treatment options, but that this would be unlikely to extend to a 24/7 service. I also heard evidence from CCC that available support would now be considered under s17 Children Act or s117 Mental Health Act or both but that this would need to be jointly funded between social care and health. I remain concerned that a clear pathway to securing overnight assistance (even if only on a respite basis) for similar cases of exceptional need has not yet been clearly agreed between CPFT and CCC. I am concerned that if alternative supported accommodation in the community were the best solution, there does not appear to be provision for it in-area, so that admission to a mental health unit becomes more likely. (2) Involvement of CCC alongside CPFT in complex adolescent mental health cases where the risk is of suicide / self-harm (For CCC). In some respects CCC's involvement in Chris and Sam's care (social care and education) lacked direction, focus, knowledge and efficiency. I heard evidence of improvements in training in the relevant education and social work teams, and concerning the new Strong Families, Strong Communities Securing Best Outcomes for Children Strategy (March 2021). Further, that CCC is restructuring all of its early help and adolescent services and will be implementing a formal contextual safeguarding framework and that these developments will be in place by the end of 2021. I am concerned that in the midst of restructuring and new guidance, there remains a risk that education inclusion officers and social workers on the ground may still not have sufficient knowledge, guidance and supervision to ensure that CCC give practical and robust support to parents and adolescent patients, alongside treating healthcare agencies, where the main risk of serious harm to the child is from self- harm or suicide arising from adolescent mental health disorders, rather than neglect of harm by a third party. (3) Diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (For CPFT). I am concerned that the evidence in Chris' case, in particular, suggested a degree of age-related reluctance consistently to use the terminology of Borderline Personality Disorder (or Emerging Personality Disorder or EUPD), even when a highly specialist second opinion had supported this and appeared to have been accepted. There are risks associated with a reluctance to use a personality disorder diagnosis (c.f. Position Statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists dated January 2020). I received evidence that there have already been some changes/improvements in the preparedness to recognise Borderline Personality Disorder and that further consideration will be given in the context of the new ICD 11. (4) AWOL patients from Darwin Centre for Young People (For CPFT). I heard evidence that since Chris' death, staff have been reminded of the applicable policies; and that an audit has shown good compliance with the provision for calling the local signallers. I heard evidence that there is to be a further review of CPFT's own AWOL policy. I remain concerned that: (i) CPFT's own policy is too lengthy and complex to serve as reference-guidance during a live AWOL incident. In particular the flow chart summary is unnecessarily complex and hard to follow (at least as a tool to consult during a stressful incident); (ii) there is a risk of confusion in having two policies both of which are meant to be followed; (iii) there did not appear be desktop-drills / other training exercises / information grab-packs (etc.) to ensure that all nurses in charge are properly equipped and trained to deal with AWOL incidents efficiently (iv) steps ought to be taken at managerial level to ensure that the confusion over the two policies and whether one had been superseded (evidence of which only emerged during the inquest) cannot recur in this, or other areas, when new policies are introduced. 4 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was: • Sam died by suicide by an overdose of prescribed medication. • The main cause of Sam's death was her borderline personality disorder, which treating clinicians assessed to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood. The disorder caused a persistent but unpredictable and fluctuating risk of serious deliberate self-harm and suicide. • There was a wider narrative conclusion, the aspect most relevant to this report being that: “There was a systemic weakness and failing in the lack of a protocol for [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service – CAMHS] and the GP service to communicate with local pharmacies concerning 16-18 year old patients with mental health conditions who were at risk of deliberate overdose. Sam was therefore able to pick up older prescriptions on 1 September 2018 without challenge. It was those medications … that were fatal in the combined amounts Sam ingested on the night of 1-2 September 2018.” 4","There was a safety plan agreed with Sam's consultant psychiatrist whereby, although Sam was over the age of 16, Sam's parents would be responsible for her medication. On 30 August 2018, Sam's treating psychiatrist in the community made a change to Sam's medication giving her a paper prescription. Sam expressed a preference to tell her mother about the change in medication (new prescription of Topiramate) directly and the psychiatrist had to make a judgement call whether or not to breach medical confidence and tell Sam's mother about this directly. On balance she chose not to. In the event, Sam did not tell her mother about the new prescription. Shortly before 1 pm on Saturday 1 September 2018, Sam instead went to her local pharmacy with the prescription for Topiramate and Lorazepam. She collected those medications as well as 2 older prescriptions for other medications she would previously not have known were being held there. At her home on School Lane, Fulbourn at some time after 01.23 on the morning of 2 September 2018, Sam took a very large quantity of some of the prescribed medications. She went to bed, fell unconscious and died within at most a couple of hours. The local pharmacy (who do not have access to patients' records on SystmOne) had not been told about the safety plan. As Sam was 16 years old, she was assumed competent to take her own prescriptions and the pharmacists had no immediate reason not to provide them to Sam, being ignorant of the safety plan. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) There did not appear to be any national guidance or standards that directed or encouraged appropriate sharing of risk information and care plans with the local pharmacy. As a result, the pharmacy was unsighted on the fact that the treating psychiatric team had a safety plan involving Sam's parents being responsible for handling and administering all medication. Had the pharmacy been aware of this plan, it is likely that they would either have refused to provide the medication with which Sam overdosed or, at least, contacted Sam's parents or General Practitioner. (2) A local protocol has now been introduced whereby the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ensures that any pharmacy used regularly by their patients aged 16-17 are (where appropriate) advised of relevant care plans, as well as the responsible GP being so informed. This is now to be part of mandatory training for CAMHS prescribing staff and is to be discussed in the local Joint Prescribing Group to ensure better communication between the local NHS Trusts, G.P.s and local pharmacies. Accordingly, action has already been taken in the local area to prevent similar fatalities. However, (3) I am concerned that there is a risk of future fatalities if action is not taken at a national level to ensure that pharmacies are appropriately involved in medication safety plans for mental health patients aged 16 – 17, given that such patients may otherwise be able to obtain prescribed medication with which to overdose. 6"

The determination of the inquest as to the medical cause of death was a massive head injury and multiple trauma owing to impact with a train, and as to conclusion, suicide. 2 4","In Autumn 2018, Xuanze was a student attending Coventry University enrolled on a degree course in Architecture. He was aged 17, having been born on 10/12/2000 in the Heping district of Shenyang, China. He was living in student accommodation. At Coventry University he was categorised as a Tier 4 overseas student. Due to his age and nationality he was required to have a guardian within the UK. A condition of his UK student visa was that he attended his university course. Xuanze's attendance on his university course was limited. Because of the amount of the course he missed he was sent a number of emails requesting his attendance at meetings with staff to discuss his absence. He did not respond to these invitations which resulted in an email being sent to him on 29/11/2018, indicating that he was at risk of being removed from the course and that he should attend a meeting to discuss this on 03/12/2018; removal from the course would in turn have affected his permission to remain in the UK on his student visa. There was no face to face meeting with Xuanze in advance of the email being sent to him on 29/11/2018, and neither Xuanze's family nor his guardian were informed that Xuanze was not attending his university course, nor were they informed of the meeting he had been requested to attend to discuss his removal from the course. On 03/12/18 shortly before 5 a.m. Xuanze left his student accommodation and went to Coventry Railway station. He walked to the end of platform one and proceeded along the side of the tracks. Approximately 500 meters outside of Coventry Railway station heading south, Xuanze was struck by a passenger train which caused him to sustain catastrophic injuries. He is likely to have died instantly as a result of the collision and his life was formally declared extinct at 07:35 hours. The inquest conclusion is suicide. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The investigation concluded by way of an inquest hearing from 2 to 5 December 2019 (a copy of the record of inquest is enclosed with the covering letter to this report). My findings at inquest were as follows: -

- Medical cause of death: -
1a Ligature around the neck.
1b Mental health issues and autism.

- Summary of circumstances: -
Jacob died as a result of placing plastic ties around his neck as ligatures. Although he had not given any immediate indication to anyone that he was contemplating taking his own life he was assessed as being at on-going risk of serious self-harm. Due to the nature of the act, his self-harm history, the on-going assessed risk, and his leaving of a 'suicide' note I found that he had undertaken a deliberate act with the intention of taking his own life. Just prior to his death a six month unregulated placement had recently been ended, and prior to that placement he had spent over two and a half years in a succession of secure placements.

On the evidence I did not find that factors associated with the unregulated placement had directly contributed to Jacob's death.

- My conclusion as to Jacob's death was a short form conclusion of suicide.","Jacob had diagnoses of autism and mental health problems. Following a serious overdose in February 2014 he was thereafter placed in a succession of secure placements under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983 and the Children Act 1989 until he returned to his home area of Chesterfield around Christmas 2016 when he was placed, under the provisions of s.20 Children Act 1989, in an unregulated placement for young people aged between 16 and 18 years of age and was also supported by local authority social care and child and adolescent mental health services. The Chesterfield placement was not a specialist placement for young people with autism or mental health problems and the placement had been made in the context of a specialist placement having given very short notice of termination of placement. There had been many episodes of self-harm following the overdose in February, some serious, including just two months prior to his death and he was assessed at on-going risk of serious self-harm. The Chesterfield placement came to an end following Jacob's decision to move in to live with his father where he received on-going support from the agencies.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

As I have stated I did not find that the evidence established a causal or contributory connection between the unregulated placement and Jacob's death. I found this to be so on the applicable civil law test, the balance of probabilities. However in my summing-up I did express my serious concerns that Jacob had been placed in an unregulated placement despite his history, needs, and risks.

Evidence was given at the inquest hearing by two former employees at the placement that they had no prior experience of working with young people (indeed no experience of working in any form of care-related work) and were left in charge of the unit where Jacob was placed after a very short period of commencing employment (one former staff member said that he had only completed two shadowing sessions before being asked to be in sole charge of the unit overnight).

The evidence of the responsible local authority was that it had not sought evidence from the placement provider as to staff competency and training, or that suitable policies and procedures were in place; it effectively accepted the assurances of the provider.

The local authority stated that it now has systems providing for greater scrutiny and diligence but it was explained that where residential/supported provision is solely for young people aged 16 to 18 that provision falls outside or the statutory regime of inspection and regulatory compliance as enforced by Ofsted. My understanding is that the issue of unregulated placements for 16 to 18 year olds has been widely highlighted as a cause for concern but the evidence of a senior local authority manager at inquest was that she was unaware of any plans nationally to address the issue despite concerns having been very widely raised.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: -

1. Vulnerable young people, aged 16 to 18, are being placed in unregulated placements.

2. Any young person under the age of 18 placed in an unregulated placement is likely to have very significant vulnerabilities, and it is likely that young people with complex needs and at significant risk are being placed in such placements; indeed this was the case for Jacob.

3. As the placements are unregulated there are no statutory regulations to comply with relating to competency and appropriate policies and procedures by the provider and there is no regulatory body to check and assess those providers. This is clearly a very concerning situation given the very high level needs that some of the young people will have.

4. The lack of statutory regulation then places an onus on local authorities to check that a provider is competent and safe. Whilst in making individual placements it must be the duty of a local authority to satisfy itself as best as it is able that placements are 'safe', given the pressures on local authorities it cannot be the case that they are in a position to mirror the type and nature of inspection and oversight that might be provided by a regulator such as Ofsted.

5. In view of the points made above the lack of statutory regulation is placing vulnerable young people at risk, and there is a realistic possibility that deaths may occur."

Name:

Daniel Cameron SHORROCKS

Medical Cause of Death:

Multiple Injuries

Conclusion:

Took own life

On 1 January 2018 at Berry Head, Torbay, Devon","The deceased was born in Torbay on 3 September 2000. Before his birth Torbay Childrens Social Care had identified potential for his significant harm following his birth.

He was known to the Police by September 2002 when he was found playing alone in a park. Reports were made to Torbay Childrens Social Care indicating that he had been neglected.

At age five, consideration was given to long term care by Torbay Childrens Services. In June 2007 approval was given for a kinship care in Essex. This was brought to an end at short notice and he was returned to Torbay. He spent several years in various foster care and respite care placements. The precise number of placements could not be identified.

In January 2010 he was made know to the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service following his jumping a river and expressing a wish to die. On 18 September 2017 the deceased's then foster carer became concerned for his welfare, having found a note. The Police were notified. The deceased was located on a viaduct by the Police and taken to a place safety for assessment. He was referred to the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service Crisis Team. The Crisis Team subsequently closed his support/case. On 14 December 2017 he was accepted into the Torbay Autism Assessment Service.

On 1 January 2018 the deceased told his then foster carer that he was going to visit a friend and would return at 7pm. The deceased visited his friend. The account of the investigating Police Officer is that he discussed ending his own life with the friend. At 7.01pm his foster carer received a text 'Dead at Berry Head'. The deceased's jacket was located at the top of a cliff at Berry Head. His dead body was at the foot of the cliff.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) I ask please that your Department reviews the availability of resources to those Local Authorities which have a high proportion of young people in care and disproportionately few qualified and experienced staff.

(2) I would also ask your Department to review the integration of services between Local Authority Care Services, Adolescent Mental Health Services and Pastoral Care provided in education settings."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28/06/2019. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging from ligature around the neck 4,"Sam died on 09/11/2018 at home Milton Keynes having been found hanging by the neck by his sister on her return from school. Sam had been engaged with COMPASS services through a school referral. He had been referred to CAMHS in May 2018 but did not meet the threshold for engagement. His GP suggested other organisations who Sam could approach voluntarily for support, but he did not take up these suggestions. 5","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1) Sam's GP referred Sam to CAMHS when he presented to the GP with irritability, anger and a report that he was close to being excluded from school. CAMHS rejected the referral because Sam did not meet their threshold of moderate to severe mental health issues. CAMHS did not suggest any alternative assistance. The GP did follow up with Sam to sign post him to two independent organisations who Sam would have to approach independently for help. The GP made it clear in his evidence that there is a lack of lower level assistance for young people who present with 'life issues' such as low mood, irritability and anger issues, but who nonetheless need help and assistance but do not meet the criteria for access to CAMHS services. 2) Sam had been referred to, and was receiving the services of COMPASS having been referred by his School. The GP was not made aware of this engagement and was unable to take this into account at the time when Sam did present himself to the GP. The evidence from COMPASS is that they maintain the confidentiality of patients even minors using their services unless they have express consent to disclose that information from the patient themselves. Without all relevant information neither the GP nor CAMHS was in a position to make a fully informed decision about the Sam's needs. Sharing of information between relevant health agencies to ensure fully informed decisions are made as regards the healthcare needs of an individual should be a priority. 3) Evidence at the inquest from the GP also indicated that a reduction in healthcare provision at Sam's school and in particular the removal of a medically qualified person(s) has meant that confidential health information is no longer shared between the school and the GP surgery. The school now only engages First Aiders, who are not medically qualified, and who do not therefore exchange information which in the past has proved essential in flagging concerns between the GP and the School. This is another route which has been closed and which would have allowed a potential flag to have been raised in respect of concerns around Sam and his wellbeing to be shared confidentially between GP and school. 6"
1872,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/geoff-gray/,2019-0216,2019-06-20,HH Peter Rock QC,Surrey,1. The Chief,On 26 February 2019 I commenced an inquest into the death of Pte Geoff GRAY. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2019 The conclusion of the inquest was that Geoff Gray's death was by suicide. 4,"At approximately 01.10 hours on 17 September 2001 in the grounds of the Officers' Mess of the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, Surrey, Private Geoff Gray was found shot. Beside him was a SA80 rifle that was set to automatic, he had two fatal wounds to the head. Geoff was 17½ years old. At the very outset the assumption was made by attending civilian and military police and by the coroner's officer that this death was a suicide. A 'routine' coronial post-mortem was requested and was performed on the day of Geoff's death. The examining pathologist was told the death was not-suspicious and was not directed by the coroner to carry out a forensic post-mortem. The examination was therefore one of several bodies examined in that session. There were no investigating police officers present who could give further information to the pathologist if required (albeit for training purposes two members of the RMP had attended). In the course of the post-mortem examination: no photographs were taken; there were no x-rays or other imaging undertaken; a body map was not drawn; there was no attempt to reconstruct the skull or track the bullets; there was no attempt to match entry wounds to the relevant item of clothing (a beret). The deceased's clothes were sent for destruction the next day rather than retained for chemographic analysis. 2 The examining pathologist, who was a forensic pathologist, told me that generally photographs and x-rays would not be taken at a routine post mortem and that he would never do so. Other investigative inadequacies in the investigation of Geoff Gray's death were added to by the absence of either a forensic post-mortem, or at least additional steps being taken within a 'routine' coronial post-mortem and the retention of Geoff's clothes. Two earlier deaths of young trainees from gunshot wounds at the same barracks in 1995 (Private Sean Benton and Ms Cheryl James), were also both investigated with 'routine' coronial post-mortems. In Sean Benton's case I have earlier heard the fresh inquest into his death, which concluded in July 2018. His post-mortem was carried out by a general histopathologist, who had no experience of performing an autopsy after a death from high velocity gunshot wounds. At the inquest into the death of Sean Benton two expert Forensic Pathologists, and produced a joint report in which they agreed that much potentially useful evidence had been lost due to inter alia the absence of post-mortem photographs and the lack of adequate post-mortem description in relation to both the external and internal features of the gunshot wounds. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. I instructed as an independent expert in forensic pathology. He told me that the practice in Northern Ireland is that every firearms death, whatever the circumstances, will be subject to a forensic post-mortem. 2. Both and , the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem told me that that there is no specific guidance to either pathologists, and as I understand it to coroners, that urges them to give particular consideration to the nature of the post- mortem examination in cases of death by firearms, even when that death is of a child. 3. It is of concern that where assumptions of suicide lead to cursory post- mortem investigations this creates a risk that homicides will go undetected. The higher the possibility that homicides will be distinguished from self-inflicted deaths, the greater the deterrence to those who might have reason to try to make a murder look like a suicide. 3 4. The use of a forensic post-mortem, or at very least something more than a basic 'routine' examination in all cases of sudden death by gunshot may, by enhancing the quality of investigations and ensuring that assumptions of suicide are properly tested, reduce that risk. 6"

Chief Executive, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust Copied for interest to: 2. Noah Lomax's family. 3. The Crookes GP Practice, Sheffield. 1",An investigation was commenced into Noah Lomax's death on 8 August 2018 and an Inquest was opened the same day. I concluded an inquest on 24 May 2015. The findings of the court were as follows: Medical Cause of death 1(a) Multiple Injuries Conclusion: Suicide 4,"Noah was 15 years of age. At the beginning of July 2018 Noah's mother was made aware of online communication between Noah and a friend in which he expressed an intention to take his own life by jumping off a bridge. Noah's mother acted immediately upon this concern and both made an appointment for Noah to see his GP and to attend Door43 an organisation that provides emotional support for young people. Noah's and his mother attended the GP appointment with the specific intention to obtain help by way of a referral to CAMHS. Noah's GP was told that he had suicidal thoughts and had plans to take his own life. Noah's GP completed a written, non-urgent, referral to CAMHS CAMHS processed the referral promptly but the referral contained insufficient information for a risk assessment to be performed Therefore, CAMHS closed Noah's referral but invited his GP to provide further information. Noah's GP planned to use the appointment arranged on 6 August 2018 as an opportunity to obtain the further information sought by CAMHS. Noah's family were not notified that CAMHS had declined the referral. The Trust accepted that the process of requesting further information was not sufficiently robust and that telephone contact with the GP should have been made. This would have avoided the need for a re-referral. Had the information been known that Noah was actively making plans to take his own life CAMHS would have categorised his appointment as urgent and seen him within 2 weeks. Assumptions were made regarding the support being offered to Noah by Door43. The Trust accepted that the actual level of support ought to have been confirmed directly between CAMHS and Door43. The Trust accepted that the current referral form does not capture the information required to process referrals without delay. Noah went on holiday with his father and step-mother between 22 July and 29 July 2018. Noah was not seen by CAMHS on his return. On 1 August 2018 Noah was not open with his mother about his plans. Instead of spending the day with friends he travelled, by a pre-planned route, to Conisborough Viaduct. Sometime after 1.30pm Noah took his own life by jumping from the Viaduct. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. As I made clear during the Inquest I was concerned about the adequacy of the CAMHS, GP referral form. , Noah's GP, was inexperienced she had not completed a CAMHS referral form before. She accepted that she had not provided sufficient detail in the form. This resulted in CAMHS being unable to assess Noah's risk and declining Noah's referral. This in turn meant that Noah did not receive an appointment with CAMHS before his death. The Trust's investigation report stated that the evidence “suggests that the current referral form does not capture the information required to process referrals without delay.” , CAMHS Clinical Lead, said that there had not been any other problems with the form with GP's not completing them sufficiently. I am not sure how is able to be so confident about this. I was told that redesigning the form had been considered by the Trust but was told that this was not the answer. Instead, further training has been provided to GPs within the area. Guidance is attached to the form to assist GPs in completing the form. Having carefully considered the evidence I am not satisfied that steps have been put in place to ameliorate the risk identified. Given the realities of the pressures on a GP's day expecting a GP to use their 10 minute appointment to extract sufficient information for the referral and then at some point complete a referral form, with which they may be unfamiliar, creates the risk that relevant information may not be provided. I would invite the Trust to reconsider whether the form could be improved to reduce the risk of inadequate or insufficient information being provided which may result in a delay in care. 6"

He was discovered at around 1640 and despite advanced life support measures was confirmed as having died at 1812 at Salisbury District Hospital in Wiltshire the same day.

At about an hour earlier he had lnstagrammed a friend in respect of which he was aware that a school friend of his had spoken to a teacher earlier that day and he was hopeful that he would get some support and help. A couple of Brad friends had become increasingly concerned for Brad especially following their return to school about a week earlier and had spoken to the Head of Year that morning. I was satisfied having heard the evidence that an immediate risk of harm was not conveyed to the Head of Year and in fact one of the students who spoke with the teacher in evidence indicated that he personally did not think that Brad would go through with his actions and take his own life. The evidence was clear that shortly before the return to school, for the Spring term, that Brad's outlook had changed and when talking about self-harm and suicide Brad's tone took a more serious nature and this ultimately was of concern to his friends. As I sure you are aware communication these days is not simply face to face and in the digital age there are many internet based communication platforms that people, especially young persons, use to communicate and one of those platforms was Discord and before returning to school Brad appeared to be expressing thoughts of taking his own life and this continued whilst gaming following their return to school. He actually indicated that he had made an attempt 2 days earlier but his friends for fear that their parents would ban them from using their electronic equipment did not communicate this to anybody. What was apparent from the evidence was that Brad was becoming increasingly aware of the concept of suicide and exploring methods. There was evidence that pointed to him if not directly viewing the video footage taken by (You Tuber) of a Japanese Forest where people hang themselves, that he did enter and view discussions on the subject and also entered other discussions boards such as Reddit where suicide was being advocated for and advocated against and where methods were being discussed. It was clear to me that Brad was developing an unhealthy interest in relation to the concept of suicide and the means to achieve one's own death. The reason why I did not return a suicide conclusion was primarily having regard to the lnstagram message that Brad sent to his friend approximately an hour before he was found which did not point to an immediate risk of death and no note was left at the time. I found more likely than not that Brad was experimenting with the method, however, it is not commonly known that having placed an ligature around ones neck that it can compress nerves and blood vessels that can lead to unconsciousness in a matter of seconds and unless there is somebody there to cut you down the likely outcome is death. CORONE~SCONCERNS It will come as no surprise that my concern here relates to the internet and the regulation of it. Brad had access to the worldwide web however as with other cases that I am sure you are aware of that have been highlighted of late, my concern here is that some of the material Brad was exposed to was of a nature that a young person of his age should not be exposed to as they cannot, in my view, properly assimilate and process the information that they view. The amount of information on the subject of self-harm and suicide that is currently available to young persons on the internet goes beyond freedom of expression and I am concerned that the extent of such information Normalises actions which at the end of the day are simply not normal. It is not normal to self-harm and it is not normal to perform an act which results in that person's own death. I fully appreciate that the responsibility does not rest solely with Parliament, but the control of this entity has to start somewhere although I fully accept that to counter such activity will involve the combined efforts of Parliament, internet service providers, internet site owner, schools and colleges, parents/guardians as well as the young person's themselves. I can take judicial notice of when I was growing up that I do not recall ever discussing self-harm and suicide in the same way as it is discussed now, and I fear that the abundance of this type of information and the ease of its accessibility is leading to this concept of Normalisation of such actions.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25th January 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was: Narrative Conclusion Aryan Akghar died on 06.03.18 in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield following an incident on 16.02.18 when he hanged himself from a self‐administered ligature with the intent to take his own life. Aryan's death occurred against a background of four serious attempts to take his own life on 03.01.18, 06.01.18, 09.01.18 and 11.01.18. Aryan was assessed on 09.01.18 by specialists from the Adult Mental Health Trust in the Northern General Hospital Sheffield and discharged home to his family. That assessment recommended an urgent response and visit the next day by the Home Treatment Team. The Home Treatment Team declined the referral because Aryan was under 18. The STAR team in CAMHS did not at that time provide an urgent response service. The first visit by mental health professionals to Aryan therefore was not until 15.01.18 because of this gap in provision. Aryan was seen by the STAR Deliberate Self Harm team on 15.01.18, 21.01.18 and 03.02.18 and was then discharged. Aryan then hanged himself on 16.02.18. 4","Please see the narrative conclusion set out in box 3. Aryan's medical cause of death was due to hanging. All witnesses accepted that there was a gap in services for Aryan and, notwithstanding the evidence of the Medical Director of the Sheffield Children's Hospital, I remained concerned that difficulties in securing funding might jeopardise his proposed solution. 5","The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows: 5.1 A gap in services was identified for 16 and 17 years old's with urgent mental health issues, such as Aryan had. On 9th January 2018, Aryan was assessed as requiring urgent mental health input, commencing the next day. This was not available as a service for under 18's in Sheffield and Aryan did not receive any contact from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) until 15th January 2018. In evidence I was told that additional resources in the CAMHS service were close to agreement in order to prevent this kind of problem arising in the future. However, this would be subject to a commissioning process from the Clinical Commissioning Group for Sheffield which could not be guaranteed. 5.2 It was accepted in evidence by the Medical Director of the Sheffield Children's Hospital on behalf of CAMHS that such additional resource was required. The delivery of the necessary funding to properly resource the CAMHS team was not guaranteed. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16/01/2019. The conclusion of the inquest was: Ellie Long took action to end her own life. The evidence does not reveal whether she intended to die.

The medical cause of death was:
1a Hypoxic Brain Injury
1b Cardiac Arrest
1c Hanging
II Anorexia, Depression","Ellie Long was receiving treatment in the community from the Eating Disorder Service. She was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa and Depression. On the morning of 10 December 2017, Miss Long went to her bedroom, where she was found hanging later that morning. Emergency Services were called, and Miss Long was taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where she died on 12 December 2017.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. These were dealt with by way of written representations submitted on behalf of IPs. Some of the concerns raised have been dealt with and I propose taking no further action. However, as indicated in Court today, in my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The matters of concern are as follows:

1. Record keeping and Auditing of Record keeping

a) Not all records were properly recorded on Lorenzo. Further, personal handwritten notes were made of some meetings which were not then reflected in the electronic records. Some of these notes only came to light during the inquest hearing. It is, of course, imperative that all staff recognise their obligations in respect of keeping full and contemporaneous electronic records and that full disclosure of all relevant documents is made in a timely fashion before the inquest commences. This avoids potential delay in the inquest process and further distress to the family.

b) Some action has been taken by NSFT in this respect, not least in that the team is now better resourced staff-wise. Further action has been and is being taken to ensure staff appreciate the importance of full record keeping. An audit of the records has been undertaken to ensure full compliance with record keeping requirements but this will only continue until 100% compliance has been achieved.

c) Concern remains in that staff do change over time and matters raised now do not necessarily remain at the forefront of an individual's mind, especially when under time pressure. Good record keeping is an integral part of any good service and must be second nature to all staff. It must be fully appreciated by all as ""a vital component in the management of risk"". Further, record keeping has been raised elsewhere as a matter of concern within NSFT.

d) I have concern that full record keeping and disclosure requirements will not remain a priority.

2. Communication with External Agencies

a) An initial full, updating letter was sent to Ellie's GP. However no further updating information was sent. A letter was written providing updating information, but this was not sent. No further updating information was sent to the GP by telephone, letter or email.

b) The evidence heard is that efforts were made to contact the school by telephone. However, the school had no record of any such calls. There is no evidence of email or written correspondence or further telephone calls in an effort to communicate with the school.

c) It is accepted by the Trust that sharing of relevant information is necessary. NSFT has indicated it will ""remind staff of the importance of recording efforts to share information/maintain communication"".

d) Sharing of information and communication with external agencies is a matter which has been raised with NSFT on previous occasions. The importance of ""recording efforts to share information ..."" may not be sufficient to prevent future deaths. It is the importance of sharing information and communicating with external agencies that should be addressed here. Recording of information is dealt with at Point 1 above."

Chief Executive, Midlands Partnership Foundation Trust 1","On 2 nd May 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of [REDACTED] 18 years of age, and opened an inquest on the 10 th May 2018. The investigation was concluded at the end of the inquest on the 14 th and 15 th November and 17 th December 2018. [REDACTED]. . The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.",[REDACTED] was found deceased [REDACTED]. She was found [REDACTED]. [REDACTED} had mental health issues starting from around 15 to 16 years of age. They resulted in self-harm and 2 suicide attempts the last of which was in September 2017. Mental health care had been provided to [REDACTED] both before and after her 18 th birthday ([REDACTED]). She was in contact with mental health services up until the evening of the 30 th April 2018 before she killed herself the next morning.,"On the evidence various issues were addressed and set out in the coroner's determination and findings and can be referred to for wider reading. Two specific issues arose which could not be said to have caused or contributed to death but could in others. 1 Delay in IAPT counselling a) After turned 18 she moved to adult mental health services. She had parallel contact with her GP surgery . Shortly before 18th birthday, according to the MPFT clinical review (page 9 of 33), was referred to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) by the Access Team for assessment for psychological therapy or counselling. On the 14th November 2017 (page 12 of 33) it was agreed with to add her to her GP surgery waiting list for counselling in line with her treatment preference. remained on the IAPT waiting list for counselling at the time of her death. b) The evidence at the inquest was that a 3 month time interval would be optimal but in case, in relation to this GP surgery, 10 months would be the norm. Such a delay is sub-optimal and could have an adverse effect on a 2 patient waiting for counselling to commence. 2. Risk assessment and progress notes. a) The electronic records were hard for a lay person to follow or understand particularly when said to have been updated or validated with the potential for original entries to have been overwritten (as opposed to amended or deleted). If the user of the system understands it then that does not make it unfit for purpose but it was not clear how a user would readily see what had originally been written. b) This is distinct from progress notes and/or risk assessments being accurately recorded. It was not clear when and how often risk assessments should be updated and how and when they would be read in conjunction with the progress notes. Were risk assessments intended to be summaries if a user did not have time to read all the progress notes? What function were they intended to serve? Consideration should be given as to whether the system can be improved. 6"

Chief Executive Calderdale Council","On 30/1/18 I opened an inquest into the death of Ursula Niamh MacEochaigh Keogh who, at the date of her death was aged 11 years old.
The inquest was resumed and concluded on 15/11/18
I found that the cause of death to be: -
1a. Head injury
1b Fall from a height

I arrived at a narrative conclusion as follows:
On 22/1/18 Ursula Niamh MacEochaigh Keogh intended to take her own life.","On 22/1/18 Ursula left her school at Lightcliffe Academy and boarded the school bus in company with her friend. At approximately 3.30pm Ursula got off a stop earlier than usual and made her way to the North Bridge in Halifax from which she jumped. She was subsequently located at 6.20am in the river approximately 100 yards away from the Shears Inn Public House, 2km downstream from the North Bridge. When Ursula was retrieved from the waters paramedics found that she had very sadly passed away and this was confirmed at the hospital.","During the inquest I heard that Ursula's mother contacted Ursula's GP at spring Hall Medical Centre by telephone on 13/11/17 in order to discuss her concerns about Ursula's history of self-harm and that this resulted in her mother being advised by a GP to get Ursula's school involved. Although the school subsequently advised Ursula's mother to contact her GP, during the telephone conversation of 14/12/17 to further discuss Ursula's self-harming, the GP advised her mother to contact the Psychology Team attached to the school, so that Ursula could be assessed for referral to Child & Adolescent Mental Health Team if necessary, in accord with the protocol previously issued by Calderdale CAMHS referral pathway, notwithstanding that at this time the school did not have the services of a Psychology team to make the referral.

I further heard helpful evidence from [REDACTED] Highway Asset Manager, Calderdale Council), who told me about the current plans for preventative measures at North Bridge, Halifax in order to deter further like tragedies.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows: -

 To review the current practice of referral by GP to the school for consideration as to the appropriateness of referral to CAHMS
 Consider improving communications between professionals, particularly health and education to eliminate contradictions offered in the advice.
 Consider the appropriateness of fast tracking the implementation of preventative measures currently under consideration at North Bridge Halifax"

Ben had little involvement with any services at the time of his death. Bury Safeguarding Childrens Board have undertaken a Serious Case review into previous contact and a number of learning points arise from this.
However during the course of the Inquest evidence was heard on one specific issue which I am of the opinion needs to be addressed in order to prevent future deaths. Details of this are set out below.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
During the course of the investigation into Bens death it emerged that on a number of days in the month prior to his death he had searched on the school (St Phillips Secondary school) computers ""how to kill myself "", ""how to tie a noose"" and "" why I shouldn't commit suicide"".
It was explained to the Court that the school filters are accessed via Smoothwall which provides age appropriate filtered content. Whilst Ben could not access these pages as they were blocked , there was no mechanism in place at the time for the school to be made aware that a pupil may have attempted to search for such pages.
The Court heard evidence that at the time of Ben's death the only monitoring was in lessons and was solely reliant on the teacher trying to watch what students were doing. The school has 900 pupils and the Court heard in any one day there can be 12,000 attempts by pupils to access blocked content. Not all of these would be as concerning as the content Ben was trying to access, some may relate to social media pages which the school does not allow.
Evidence was provided to the Court that since Ben's death, Smoothwall have now upgraded functionality and staff now receive notifications when blocked high risk safeguarding categories are attempting to be accessed.
These alerts are ""real time"" notifications and go to three identified members of staff. Since this installation staff have been notified of two other children attempting to access similar sites to Ben and have taken action to speak to them and also to speak to their parents to offer support.
However it is not known if this functionality is mandatory for all schools or indeed whether other software providers who are used by schools have this option.
If schools do not have this facility you may wish to consider disseminating this information, this is of course a matter for yourself."

[REDACTED] CNWL CCG Chair Central & North West London NHS Foundation Trust HQ Stephenson House 75 Hampstead Road London. NW1 2PL","On the 3rd October 2018, evidence was heard touching the death of Maximilien Conrad Kohler. Max had been found deceased hanging by a belt around his neck from a pull-up bar positioned across his bedroom door at his home address. He was 15 years old at the time of his death. The findings of the court were as follows:

Medical Cause of Death

1 (a) Fatal pressure to the neck

How, when and where the deceased came by his death:

Max suffered with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Syndrome. At times symptoms of ASD would overwhelm him and he would attempt to take his own life or self-harm. On 5/5/2018 he was found hanging by his father at his home address. Despite resuscitation his life could not be saved and he was recognised as life extinct at 07:23. He had left 2 messages expressing intent and demonstrating capacity.

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death:

He took his own life whilst suffering from Autistic Spectrum Disorder","Evidence taken at the inquest confirmed that Max had not been diagnosed with ASD until he saw a third and very experienced Child and Adult Psychiatrist, at least in part because Max was clever and able to cross compensate for the issues that the ASD caused him and instead had been incorrectly diagnosed with depression and bulimia nervosa, of which there was no evidence when he was assessed at length in an inpatient setting. These diagnoses had at least in part been arrived at by the use of questionnaires. Expert evidence was taken and accepted by the court that the earlier misdiagnosis may have been contributed to by the latest fashion in mental health to over rely on questionnaires and perhaps less upon clinical evaluation of the whole picture presented by the patient. It is possible that such over-reliance can contribute to misdiagnoses and underestimate risk.

The over reliance on the use of questionnaires to assess the risk of self-harm, compared to full psychiatric history taking and evaluation of the patient in the round by a clinician with experience has been a repeated theme in inquests.

It was also discussed and accepted by the court that the current training regime for the training of specialist doctors is shorter that it was in the past so that doctors now become consultants with far less experience at senior registrar level, and consequently less exposure to and skill with diagnostics across the range of psychiatric conditions.

Further it was discussed and accepted by the court that there is a relative paucity of services for conditions which are chronic and difficult to treat and cure compared to illnesses which respond to short term therapies, and so show easily auditable improvements in health with the application of evidence based guidance.

This was considered by the expert and accepted by the court to reflect the style of commissioning of care by CCGs who wish to support and prioritise the services to relatively easily treatable conditions.

ASD was accepted to be a lifelong incurable condition which responds only to long term supportive care, and so to have expensive and resource rich treatment requirements. As such ASD would come towards the bottom of the pile for CCG commissioned treatment and care.

The expert stated that care provision is even worse for adults with ASD and other similar conditions than for children.

Max's parents gave extensive evidence in relation to the support and information that they have received since his suicide compared to the time when they were trying to care for him whilst he was alive. They described a lacuna in support and educational provision for parents attempting to assist a child with ASD.

When Max needed urgent in patient admission there was no bed available in London in Child and Adolescent psychiatric services, and if his parents had not been able to access private health care he would have needed to have been hospitalised in Sheffield.

A report from CNWL, accepted by the court, stated that a new facility is currently being built to provide psychiatric beds for children and adolescents in West London, but this cannot alone address the scarcity of provision across the rest of London and England.","1. That delays in diagnosis and misdiagnosis in medicine due to reduced time in training for doctors in general and psychiatry in particular, may imperil the lives of vulnerable patients.

2. That over reliance in the current fashion on questionnaires used in diagnostics and management may impede rather than assist doctors and other clinicians, firstly to arrive at the correct diagnosis in the first place, and secondly to cause or contribute to underestimation or proper evaluation of the risk of self -harm in particular.

3. That the NHS care commissioning structure is biased against the commissioning of services for chronic incurable conditions in general and ASD in particular.

4. That there is a lack of support and education available for parents caring for children with ASD.

5. That there is a severe shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for children and adolescents in the NHS.

6. That services for adults with ASD are even less well provided for by the NHS than those for children."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12/04/2018. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,"Several years before her death, Katy was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, PTSD with a history of Anxiety, Depression and an eating disorder and was under the care of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) at SLAM at the time of her death. In around May 2017, the care plan that had been formulated and notified to Katy in writing was significantly altered. Although this change was communicated orally to Katy and her family, it was not confirmed in writing and little, if any opportunity was provided to appeal this decision to alter Katy's care plan, despite the family's increasing concerns over its appropriateness for Katy. Consequently, at the time of her death Katy was under a care plan believed by the family to be unsuitable for her, thereby exacerbating a breakdown of trust on the part of Katy's family in the service provided by CAMHS/SLAM and creating a lack of provision for care or advice when a crisis, due to unexpected circumstances arose.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern, although many of these were addressed in an investigative report prepared by SLAM. However, in my opinion a continued failure to clearly communicate changes to a care plan and provide a clear route to challenging or appealing these changes, together with the provision of details of all avenues for seeking emergency and non-emergency care and advice, create a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) Failure to communicate in writing a Care Plan and changes to it.

(2) Failure to provide a clear route or opportunity to challenge or appeal these changes to the Care Plan.

North Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group. 3. Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group. 4. Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.,"On 12th April 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karen Jane Edgar. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13th April 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was Karen was suffering from emotional and behavioural issues and was referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in October 2015, aged 15. Her first substantive meeting with her mental health practitioner was on 8th February, 2016, when family work was planned. She did not start individual talking therapy until 7th April. Family therapy had ceased to be available. After only one more 1:1 session on 25th April she was, on 5th May, seen by a psychiatrist who prescribed fluoxetine-10mg. In July it was increased to 20mg. On 29th September she took an overdose of paracetamol, then raised the alarm and received inpatient general hospital attention. Her true intention was not clear. The psychiatrist changed her medication to sertraline 50mg which commenced on about 7th March 2017, after only twelve 1:1 sessions. On 22nd March she was involved in an outburst at school relating to her boyfriend, from whom she had split in February. At the 1:1 on 29th March she was angry and upset and later that day researched 'suicide note' on the internet. Sertraline was increased to 100mg on 30th March. She had convinced herself she was pregnant and told her former boyfriend on 1st April. She admitted to a friend having tried to hang herself. On the evening of 7th April she had an angry exchange with her former boyfriend over the pregnancy issue via text and went home. Whilst her parents were not in the house she hanging herself from a dressing gown cord in a wardrobe in her bedroom. She was discovered soon afterwards, but despite medical treatment did not recover and was pronounced dead at West Cumberland Hospital at 01.10 hours on 8th April. She had made a cut in the ligature with a pair of scissors.
Medical cause: Hanging.

Conclusion: Misadventure; she hanged herself as a gesture intending to be discovered.","Karen had been displaying behavioural and anger problems for many months when there was a major incident in August 2015 which resulted in her and her parents seeking help. Despite a referral to CAMHS in October 2015 assessment appointments did not take place until early December and January. Family work was proposed but only two meetings took place before it ceased to be available. Karen did not start 1:1 work until April 2016, nearly six months from first seeing her GP. She only had 13 talking sessions from the first assessment in December 2015 until her death in April 2017. The psychiatrist diagnosed her with moderately severe depressive disorder and prescribed antidepressants after only two 1:1 sessions. (NICE suggests 4-6 sessions). She was not monitored closely on four drug changes. It remains an open question as to whether the introduction of sertraline a month before is implicated in her death. Whilst the mental health worker did her level best it seems that the resources were inadequate to support Karen and she received sub-optimal care. The Trust's own report revealed a long list of failings including:- no care plan; lack of 'packages of care'; gaps in work force and skills base; absence of family therapy; failure to re-assess risk formally; lack of Multi-disciplinary Meetings; absence of holistic approach and not engaging more productively with her school. Many of these issues were themes found to be endemic in the Trust by the CQC in its report of 26th January 2018.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) The provision of mental health services for children and young people in Cumbria is underfunded.
(2) There are long delays in getting treatment.
(3) Failure to provide for these young people means they risk entering adulthood with unresolved mental health issues.
(4) Lives are lost and damaged; including the effect on families as a whole.
(5) The financial cost to the state of such deaths is huge; 4 paramedics attended as did an out of hours doctor; at least 11 police staff; hospital staff; A&E consultant; Local Safeguarding processes; costs of inquests and Trust's legal representation etc. all of which would be better spent on prevention.
(6) It is likely that any of these problems are replicated across the country hence the reference to the Secretary for State."

Sofia was aged 14 years when she died on 26th September 2016. The medical cause of death was hanging. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, that on 20th September 2016 at 25 Saxon Way, Cheddar, Sofia deliberately suspended herself by the neck with the intention of ending her life.","Sofia had previously suffered from low mood. In Year 8 both school and family noticed significant changes in Sofia's behaviour, including self-harming. Sofia's mother was sufficiently concerned to attend the family G.P. who wrote to CAMHS West supporting a referral from Sofia's school. By letter dated 2nd April 2015 CAMHS West stated that Sofia's difficulties did not meet criteria for specialist CAMHS intervention.

In February 2016 Sofia attended her G.P. with her mother, Sofia's hair was starting to break, her self-confidence fell as her hair became thinner. Sofia and her mother returned to the G.P. a number of times and in June 2016 the G.P. agreed if Sofia was stressed, it was documented that Sofia has been low for months, was self-harming again but denied any suicidal thoughts. Following an attendance at the G.P. on 12th July 2016 it was noted that Sofia has expressed some suicidal thoughts. An expert referral was made to CAMHS West. Sofia was seen by a care-co-ordinator at CAMHS West on 15th July 2016 and again on 29th July 2016. Sofia was given the opportunity to speak to the care coordinator alone. Sofia was placed on a 6 month waiting list for CBT. Sofia appeared to her mother to have a good summer holiday but upon returning to school in September 2016 Sofia started to isolate herself. Sofia's mother arranged an appointment with Sofia's care coordinator at CAMHS on 19th September 2016. Again Sofia had the chance to speak to the care co-ordinator alone and again Sofia admitted to suicidal thoughts. From the evidence of the care co-ordinator and Sofia's mother it was identified that there was a difference in recollection of what was discussed and expressed at that meeting. Matters that the care coordinator identified as discussed were not subsequently identified in Sofia's care plan, the care co-ordinator has no urgent contact with Sofia's school and no urgent contact with a psychiatrist. No follow up appointment was made. On the following day 26th September 2016 Sofia's mother following discussions with Sofia attended work and upon return home discovered Sofia hanging. Sofia left an apologetic 'suicide note'.","1. Access to CAMHS. Sofia was rejected for referral in April 2015. Might a lower threshold and earlier proactive interventionist policy has been of positive benefits to Sofia.
2. Availability of CBT. Sofia was placed on a 6 month waiting list for CBT. This delay appears considerable.
3. Sofia's care co-ordinator at CAMHS did not obtain the urgent input of a psychiatrist in accordance with NICE guidance.
4. The recollections of Sofia's care co-ordinator and Sofia's mother as to the meeting of the 19th September were at odds with each other. Sofia's care co-ordinator recollected in her evidence telling Sofia's mother that Sofia was not to be left alone. Sofia's mother deemed the impression from Sofia's care co-ordinator's evidence was of Sofia being an extremely vulnerable and dangerous position abut this was not reflected in Sofia's care plan which made no mention of her not being left alone and it was not reflected in the care co-ordinator's actions in not urgently contacting Sofia's school, where she would be during the following days to a psychiatrist. Her care plan appears to be the critical written record of the outcomes of this meeting as it was not of sufficient detail to safeguard Sofia.
5. Language used in the SIRI Report was felt to be inappropriate. The SIRI Report effectively said if the care plan had been followed the outcome might have been different and that no change in clinical practice would have resulted in any different outcome. I do not believe either of these statements were true."

Brandon was last seen face to face by one of the treating team on the 31 May 2016 and the final contact with him was on the 03 August 2016. Cause of Death was:- 1a) Severe Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy 1 b) Strangulation by hanging 4","In April 2105 Brandon refused to go to school and became more and more reclusive and anxious. He was taken to the GP by his mum and he was entered into the care of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. He was diagnosed with low mood and anxiety and was treated with fluoxetine. His mental health continued to deteriorate and he refused to engage with any professionals tasked with trying to assist him. His mother went to his mental health appointments alone without her son and the majority of the contact with either her or Brandon was by telephone. At times she managed to get him into the car but when they arrived at the appointment he absolutely refused to get out of the car in order to see the clinician due to his anxieties. Appointments were made appropriately by health care staff but contact with him by health professionals was via occasional telephone calls, when he agreed to speak to them. The last face to face contact with any member of the health care team was on the 31 May 2016 and his suicide occurred on the 09 August 2016. It was established that the efficacy of his care was compromised because of this lack of contact but Brandon was simply too anxious to attend out patients appointments and there was no provision or funding for the clinicians to o to Brandon's home to treat him. 5",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. — (1) That there is no provision of mental health care for children in Leicestershire who due to their anxiety are unable to attend hospital for treatment. There is a CRISIS team for children but I have been told that this cannot fulfil the function of long term treatment. I.

Dr Kevin Cleary Medical Director East London NHS Foundation Trust Trust Headquarters 9 Alie Street London E1 8DE 1,"On 19 February 2002, one of my assistant coroners, Heather Williams, commenced an investigation into the death of Fallon Abby, aged 18 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 August 2017.

She was admitted to Roman Ward of Mile End Hospital because she was thought to be at high risk of suicide. She was discharged to the care of the home treatment team on Thursday, 16 February 2017. 5","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I heard at inquest that no member of the team on Roman Ward contacted Fallon's social worker. There was no protocol for this. If they had sought a collateral history from the social worker, they would have discovered that Fallon's mum was not dead as Fallon had told them, but was alive and living in a hostel. The social worker had been rung by a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, but she was waiting to be invited to a ward round at Mile End Hospital and such invitation was never made. It seems unlikely that proper discussion with the social worker would have changed the outcome for Fallon, but it would have meant that valuable information would have been shared, and it would have meant that Fallon would have had the benefit of her social worker on hand upon discharge. This might be very important for another patient. 6"
2754,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/steffan-bonnot/,2017-0450,2017-07-14,Penelope Schofield,West Sussex,Ofsted,On 5th July 2017 I concluded the inquest into the death of Steffan Bonnot born 6th November 1988 (aged 17) who died on 1st January 2016. His Inquest was originally opened on 12th January 2016. The Conclusion that I reached at the Inquest was that Steffan committed Suicide. At the time of his death he was in the care of Brighton and Hove Local Authority.,"Steffan was a young man who has had spent a considerable amount of time in foster care and children's homes. He was due to move out of the Amicus Community Children's home and into another foster placement on 16th January 2016. It was clear from the evidence that he was concerned about leaving the Amicus Community and that he was anxious about whether or not the Foster Carers were fully appraised of his background. He had had a large number of Foster placements in the past many of which had broken down. The concerns he had about how much the Foster Carers knew caused him some anxiety.
On Friday 1st January 2016 Steffan was amongst a small group of children who attended the local cinema. This was a pre-arranged outing. On the return from the cinema Steffan's group, which consisted of two staff and another child, stopped off at MacDonalds. Shortly after arriving at MacDonalds Steffan and the other young man went to the Toilet. A member of staff followed them shortly afterwards and asked them to come out. Steffan did so but then left MacDonalds without saying anything. The staff tried to follow him and locate him. They were unable to do so and sadly Steffan body was later found at the Warningcamp footcrossing having been struck by a train. Steffan had deliberately knelt down in front of an oncoming train","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
1. The author of the serious case review reported that the prospective foster carers who were to offer a placement to Steffan had advised that they had not been made fully aware of all the background to Steffan's case. This was, however, at odds with what Steffan's Social worker told us. However there was no formal documentation detailing exactly what had been disclosed. It was not therefore possible to be clear what information the prospective Foster Carer had been given. As we know the failing to provide Foster Carers with all the background information was one of Steffan's major concerns and added to his level of anxiety about his move.
2. The above concern would apply equally to any individuals entrusted with the care of a child. All relevant information should be made available and it should be documented as to what has been provided so that the carers can make an informed decision before any placement is agreed. The young person could then be confident as to what the prospective carer's knew.

I consider that the issues raised in this case should be addressed so that future deaths do not occur in similar circumstances and that action should be taken to reduce the risk of deaths of other patients.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action by addressing these issues."

The conclusion of the Inquest was that Mr Cheese took his own life whilst suffering from a depressive disorder brought on by a series of life events. A full copy of the Narrative Conclusion is attached. 4.,Mr Cheese was an 18 year old young man who was found hanging in Woodland near his home address on 9th April 2015. He had a number of ongoing issues in his life including the potential loss of a career in the army; a fluctuating relationship with his girlfriend; an unsubstantiated concern that he might have a serious illness and he had been subject to upsetting treatment by his colleagues at work. He was under the care of his GP surgery and the local Mental Health Team who were treating him for anxiety and depression including prescribing anti- depressant medication.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless this action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) While the evidence at the Inquest dealt with the various matters ongoing in Mr Cheese's life, I also heard evidence of the care and treatment that he received from his GP surgery. One of the doctors at the surgery, gave live evidence at the Inquest. (2) Mr Cheese was prescribed Fluoxetine anti-depressant medication on the 3rd November 2014 by a treating GP, following admitting to fleeting suicidal thoughts. He was reviewed by on 14th January 2015 when Mr Cheese described daily episodes of intense low mood with suicidal thoughts which included taking an overdose. This led to a reference to the Mental Health Team. At an appointment with the Practice's Nurse Practitioner on 3rd February, Mr Cheese was prescribed 112 tablets of Fluoxetine. In the course of her evidence, stated that the Nurse Practitioner was probably just repeating the same prescription that the previous Doctor had issued to Mr Cheese but that she, , would not have done that. (3) also acknowledged, in the course of her evidence, that there was no “flag” on Mr Cheese's notes to alert treating Clinicians within the GP Practise to limit the amount of medication provided to Mr Cheese in view of his history. She acknowledged that a flag, in such circumstances, was good practise. (4) The concerns arising from the evidence are therefore the amount of medication prescribed to a patient who was known to be suffering from mental health issues and describing suicidal thoughts and a potential overdose and the fact that this was not being flagged to prevent large amounts of medication being provided to him as a matter of repeat prescription. 6."

This time the referral was accepted and your team made contact with her by telephone on 21/10/2016. She declined an appointment because she felt she could not get to the venue.

There was no attempt to contact Annabel thereafter. An unsuccessful attempt to contact the referrer was made on 4/11/2016- the day Annabel took her own life.
The time period between referral and initial contact and attempted follow up appears considerable.
No attempt appears to have been made to engage with her parents who would have been in a position to assist with transport arrangements.
The expectation that young people such as Annabel would 'opt in 'to the system may be unrealistic given the difficulties that she had in engaging.
Annabel might well have benefitted had she been offered a more proactive service."

‘On the 4th April 2015 Joshua Harry Smith aged 16 years attended a party at a friend’s house, Joshua drank some alcohol, but was not drunk. He seemed fine when Joshua’s father collected him; arriving home at 00.30 a.m. on the 5th April 2015. At 02.15 a.m., Joshua contacted ambulance control by 999 call asking for an ambulance. He was below the cliffs near the southernmost part of Spittal Beach, (Northumberland) having fallen. Joshua had intended to jump from the cliff, then changed his mind, slipped and fell down the cliff to the bottom. Earlier text and Facebook messages showed that Joshua was thinking of taking his own life. After a prolonged search Joshua was eventually found clinging to a rock in the water at the base of the cliff at 04.01 a.m. There had been significant delays because Joshua’s first call to ambulance control advising his location as ‘Spittal’ was not heard until it was later played back, and while ambulance, police, fire and other agencies tried to locate Joshua. There was no indication that JESIP principles (Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Program) were followed regarding briefings or co-ordination of resources, and the Berwick ambulance crew felt that there was no search co-ordinator or person taking overall control. Other agencies did not feedback what resources they had committed to the incident. When Joshua was eventually located at 04.01 a.m., he lost his grip while holding onto a rock, and he was taken away from the shore by movement of the waves. An RAF Sea King helicopter by that time arrived and Joshua was winched out of the sea unconscious, and conveyed to Wansbeck General Hospital. Sadly Joshua’s death was confirmed at 06.15 a.m. at Wansbeck General Hospital.",As described in the above narrative.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

At 2.15 a.m. when Joshua made his 999 call he stated to Ambulance control that he had fallen from a cliff near Spittal Beach (which is on the south side of the River Tweed) and injured himself, that he was alone and was unable to walk.

Police and other emergency services were not immediately alerted from the outset of the information provided in Joshua’s telephone call to 999. Joshua’s location could not be identified from the mobile phone call made to 999.

Two Police Officers on Berwick Town Centre duties (which is north of the River Tweed) were asked in the street by paramedics for assistance in locating Joshua, and while paramedics went to look for Joshua on the north side of Berwick near the Holiday Park and cliffs, the police officers travelled to Spittal looking for Joshua although they had no name or further details at that time. A brief search of Spittal beach near to the cliffs by Police Officers was unsuccessful, before they returned to Town Centre duties. A report to Police Control was not made at that time.

The search for Joshua was briefly stood down after a North East Ambulance call to Joshua’s father indicated that Joshua was at home in his bedroom, without waiting for [REDACTED] to check and confirm whether Joshua was in fact in his bedroom.

The search for Joshua continued at Berwick Holiday Park (on the north side of the River Tweed and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed) as a result of his location at Spittal Beach not being recognised from his 999 call.

After Joshua’s phone call was ‘listened back’ it was observed that he had described his location as Spittal, at the bottom of a cliff, near Spittal beach.

Joshua had explained in his 999 call that he was below cliffs having fallen, was injured and that an ambulance would not be able to reach him. The Hazardous Area Response Team of North East Ambulance was not deployed to the incident until approximately 3 a.m. arriving at the scene under an hour later and were 1.5 miles away from the incident at the time Joshua was swept out to sea by action of the waves.

The circumstances of the incident showed that although there were examples of good co-operation and effort among the emergency services, overall command, control and co-ordination were unclear and JESIP was not followed."

The Jury determined that Amy had died from the complications arising from Hypoxic Ischaemic Brain damage following the tying of a ligature around her neck. The Jury return a narrative questionnaire in which they found that Amy's death had been contributed to by Neglect and they also found that there were a number of causative failures which led to her death. A copy of the narrative questionnaire is attached.","Amy El Keria was aged 14 years old at the material time. She had a range of complex needs associated with a number of mental health diagnoses. Up until the time of her hospital admission she lived with her mother and sister in Hounslow. Following her exclusion from school in early 2012 her mental health deteriorated and she started to ligature. In August 2012 she was seen for an emergency outpatient assessment and a planned inpatient admission was sought. However there were no specialist Child and Adolescent high dependency beds available immediately and Amy had to be admitted to the Priory Hospital at Roehampton. The following day she transferred to the Ticehurst House Hospital which is part of the Priory Group. During her stay at Ticehurst Amy's mental health fluctuated and at times she had to be forcefully restrained and sedated

On 12th November 2012, having told staff earlier in the day that she wanted to kill herself, she tied a ligature, namely a football scarf, around her neck and suspended herself from a radiator in her room. She subsequently died from her injuries the following day.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-

(1) The evidence given at the Inquest showed that there was a clear misapprehension by Hounslow Social Services as to their role in supporting Amy whilst at Ticehurst. It appears that Social services did not appreciate their important ongoing role to ensure Amy's welfare whilst placed at Ticehurst. [REDACTED] the Court expert, gave evidence that Hounslow may have seen this health funded placement as a stand-alone intervention that did not require their input.

(2) Social Services clearly have a vital role to play in ensuring family contact where a child is placed far from their family home where difficulties arise. There was no assessment carried out to assess whether there was any need to provide support to a child in need under Section 17 Children Act 1989 even when Amy's mother had specifically raised the difficulties she was having with contact with Amy , including the cost of travel, with her support worker.

(3) The family gave evidence to the extent that having better contact with Amy and more input into her care may have brought about a different outcome particularly when she was distressed.

I consider that the issues raised in this case should be addressed so that future deaths do not occur in similar circumstances and that action should be taken to reduce the risk of deaths of other children.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action by addressing these issues."

He was identified as being socially isolated as his family were living in Australia. He had no visits and made no telephone calls: an official visitor was planned but did not see him before he died. Liam was assaulted on 2 separate occasions by different individuals, despite being moved from the wing where the bullying had taken place, as these individuals were encountered in general areas of the prison estate.

3160,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/thomas-gallagher/,N/A: Not found,2016-08-11,L Hashmi,Greater Manchester (North),"Chief Constable for Greater Manchester Police, Force Headquarters",On the 25th July 2016. I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Martin Gallagher.,"Tom was aged 16 years at the time of his death. He had been diagnosed as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and psychosis by a child psychiatrist. In the months before his death he received care and treatment as a voluntary inpatient at a specialist adolescent mental health unit, whilst within the community he received care and support from the child and adolescent mental health team (CAMHS).
He had a history of self-harm/attempted suicide, including an attempt at self-ligature.
On the 10th July 2015 Tom had been working during the day and appeared relatively settled although he struggled to control the effects of his OCD. In the late afternoon/early evening, he became agitated and therefore decided to walk the dog in order to relieve the tension. He dropped the dog back home at around 19:30 but went straight out again. When he did not return home, his family tried to contact him on his mobile – by calls and text messaging. Tom failed to respond. This was unusual.
By 21:00 his family was becoming increasingly concerned and therefore carried out a search of the local area. At 02:44 on the 11th July 2015, Tom’s father contacted Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to report that his son was missing. The call taker created a Force Wide Incident Note (FWIN - 0405), completed the ‘1-12’ and coded the call as requiring a Grade 2 response which meant that the call required priority attendance, allocating by the radio operator within 20 minutes and attendance by a police officer within 1 hour from the creation of the Incident Log.
Tom was correctly identified as a missing person.
From this point on, the FWIN was delayed on no less than 14 occasions; the family’s call therefore remained unallocated. Almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without rationale. No service call was made to Tom’s family and as no officer was allocated, the ‘Golden Hour’ (important in terms of information gathering) was missed. The Incident Response Protocol - in particular the Grade 2 FWIN Escalation Process - was not followed, the cross-border process was not instigated and neither ‘Silver Command’ nor the OCB supervisor were made aware of the problems that were being encountered in allocating resources to FWIN 0405.
On the night in question, GMP was experiencing what was described as an ‘unprecedented/unpredictable spike’ in Grade 1-3 calls. There was also an ongoing policing operation within the town centre and staffing levels were low. The deployable resources available to the duty Inspector were approximately 50 % lower than those ‘on paper’. Staffing levels had been persistently lower than expected in the weeks before Tom’s death.
The low staffing levels of the 10-11 July 2015 were recognised in good time and were brought to the attention of the DRMU and the senior leadership team (SLT) on Monday 6th July at a routine meeting. However whilst it was agreed that additional resources would be allocated to support the Friday/Saturday shift a Chief Inspector subsequently declined to allocate/authorise this as he felt that the levels were ‘within tolerance’. This change of decision was not conveyed to the duty sergeant (who had been present at the Monday meeting) and/or divisional duty Inspector.
At around 08:00 Tom’s father made a further call to GMP as he had not heard anything. In the meantime, [REDACTED] resumed the search for her son.
At 08:07, Tom was discovered by a member of the public suspended by ligature from a tree in the park close to his home. A 999 call was made and police attended immediately. The fact of Tom’s death was confirmed by Paramedics at shortly before 08:30. Tom’s mother heard of her son’s death from a member of the public whilst trying to elicit information from an officer at the scene.
Following post mortem examination the medical cause of death was given as:
1a) Asphyxia
1b) Fatal pressure on the neck
1c) Hanging
At inquest GMP admitted shortcomings in the way that it responded to the family’s call for help.
The jury concluded suicide and added the following [sic]:
- Tom’s mental health issues
- Alteration in frequency of appointments with medical services due to transitional care
- The FWIN not being switched to supervisor after 20 minutes
- Lack of contact within the initial hour to the family
- Lack of justification for the delays on the FWIN
- It could not be concluded that the admitted shortcomings caused or contributed to the deceased’s death.
The Jury also found that Tom died ‘before 02:44 [on the] 11th July 2015’.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
1. The lack of formal training in relation to risk assessment and child mental health.

2. Save for the initial call handler, that all staff demonstrated intentional disregard of Force policies and protocols - including those with operational/management responsibilities and the Operational Communications Branch (OCB - see above).

3. That the Force has no set minimum staffing levels, including within divisional response and the OCB.

4. That when the persistently low staffing levels were brought to the attention of GMPs’ SLT, on more than one occasion, insufficient action was taken so as to ensure that the number of officers on duty matched those identified as being required ‘on paper’.

5. That when decisions were taken not to allocate additional cover/resources:
i) no rationale was recorded,
ii) no minutes were kept in relation to the decisions taken during the Monday meeting

iii) no contemporaneous record was made by the Chief Inspector regarding his decision to reverse the earlier agreement to allocate additional resources
&,
iv) the Chief inspector did not communicated his decision to those who needed to know.
6. Despite hearing evidence on the positive steps taken by GMP since Tom’s death, there was no solid evidence of resource commitment to prevent recurrence.
7. That there were 14 delays placed on FWIN 0405.
8. That almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without written rationale.
9. That FWIN 0405 went unallocated (despite some evidence of attempts to resource), resulting in the very important ‘Golden Hour’ being missed.
It was clear from the initial ‘1-12’ and the additional information recorded by the call taker within FWIN 0405 that Tom was not only vulnerable by virtue of his age but also due to the fact that he had complex mental health issues, the significance of which was arguably underestimated as a result of point 1 above.
It was accepted during the course of the evidence that the ‘1-12’ had been an initial assessment of risk only.
10. That no service call was made to Tom’s family to reassure them that they had not been forgotten."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 15th June 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was a short form suicide with narrative conclusion. The medical cause of death was 1A - Vasovagal Inhibition as a result of 1B - Hanging.","This 17 year old young lady ""Anielka"" was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in March 2010, aged 12 years and she suffered a stroke. She underwent a heart transplant in April 2010. Post procedure she recovered well from a cardiac perspective. However, she developed complicated neuro-psychological problems arising from the brain injury caused by the stroke. Anielka's home life was difficult, and she was often reluctant to engage with professionals. She engaged in risk taking behaviours, which included on occasion self-harming, alcohol, illicit drug use, and becoming involved in inappropriate relationships. In December 2014, Anielka was taken off a child protection plan which had been in place since 2011. Her care was being transitioned from child and young person's services to adult services. Multiple agencies were involved with Anielka's care, and her complex needs were identified. However, no lead professional was identified to coordinate her care. On more than one occasion the agencies did not communicate with each other. This led to missed opportunities to provide a structured care plan for Anielka. In January 2015, Anielka drew on her bedroom walls a number of images which indicated suicidal intent. Local mental health services were not made aware of this. On the 4th February 2015, she attended her final appointment at the children's transplant clinic. She travelled to Great Ormond Street with her father. Her journey was delayed by a fatality occurring on the railway line. She was also very upset after reading a report that referred to her ongoing need for support and services. The following day on the 5th February 2015, she left her father in Gloucester City centre at approximately 1000hrs. She made her way to her training college. She then departed for home. Her father returned home at about 1500 hours and found Anielka hanging by the neck from the bannister. A dressing gown cord had been used as the ligature. Her father cut her down and dialled emergency services. Paramedics arrived shortly thereafter and pronounced Anielka deceased at 1510 hours. Police are satisfied there are no suspicious circumstances. A suicide note was found at scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. -
(1) When an individual is being cared for by numerous agencies, in particular when said individual is a child transitioning to adult services, there is no lead/ key professional identified, which can result in a breakdown of communication between the agencies."

2. The Rt Hon Nicky Morgan, Minister for Education
3. The Rt Hon Eric Pickles, Minister for Local Government","On 4th April 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin, Aged 16. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20th March 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had committed Suicide. The medical cause of her death was 1a Hanging.","On the 15th of July 2003 a Care Order relating to Aleysha McLoughlin was made at Manchester County Court upon the application of Bolton Council.

Aleysha was then placed with a family member, where she remained settled until the 9th of September 2012 when she went to stay with her mother and refused to return. On the 8th of October Aleysha left her mother's address and although there was a short period thereafter when Aleysha returned to live with her family member the placement broke down. Accordingly on the 26th of November 2012 Aleysha was placed with a foster carer where she remained until her death in April 2014. As the foster carer lived in a different area Aleysha also changed schools, and at first she appeared to make a positive start at her new school. However from in or about March 2013 her schoolwork and behaviour began to deteriorate.

Likewise Aleysha appeared to settle well with her foster carer. However on the 13th of March 2013 she left her foster carer's home and did not return until the 20th of March 2013. When asked where she had been Aleysha said that she had been with her mother.

In early June 2013 the head of Aleysha's year at school had a preventative meeting with her and her foster carer to address a perceived deterioration in Aleysha's behaviour. Aleysha did not engage at that meeting, and her behaviour was perceived to continue to be poor.

On or about the 8th of June 2013 Aleysha again left her foster carer's home and did not return until the 20th of June, on this occasion saying that she had been with her sister.

On the 25th of June 2013 whilst Aleysha's sister was visiting her at her foster carer's home Aleysha reported to her carer that her sister had taken an overdose. The following evening, the 27th of June, Aleysha herself took an overdose of aspirin and paracetamol. She was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where she initially refused treatment, and even after consenting she later removed the cannula administering intravenous medication and had to be persuaded to have it restored. During Aleysha's hospital admission clinicians from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) assessed her and a further appointment was made for her to see a CAMHS clinical psychologist after her discharge from hospital. On the 5th of July 2013 Aleysha attended that appointment with her foster carer. Aleysha did not want any further involvement with CAMHS and as Aleysha's risk of further self harm was, for various reasons, believed to be reduced, it was decided that there was no ongoing role for CAMHS at that time, although an offer of re-referral was made should matters change.

When Aleysha returned to school after the summer holiday in September 2013 she was perceived as continuing to be uncooperative and difficult to engage.

On a date between in or about October 2013 and at or about Christmas of 2013 one of the Social Workers involved with Aleysha was informed by Aleysha's foster carer that Aleysha had inflicted some superficial cuts upon herself. The social worker believed that this was a historical event and did not ask Aleysha about it.

On the 7th of January 2014 Aleysha and her sister both took overdoses of aspirin and they were taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital. Clinicians wanted to admit Aleysha to the hospital for observation because she was believed to have taken a potentially life threatening overdose, but Aleysha refused to be admitted. She was seen by a Doctor in the Accident and Emergency Department of the Hospital, who decided that she had the capacity to refuse treatment and noted that she was discharged. Aleysha was subsequently seen by a Doctor specializing in mental health, who had concerns that Aleysha did not, in fact, have the capacity to refuse treatment. However medical staff would not then admit Aleysha to the hospital because a medical doctor had discharged her. Whilst discussions about this were continuing Aleysha left the hospital with her sister, who was also refusing treatment. Aleysha and her sister were returned to the hospital the following morning, and a mental health nurse who was a member of the Rapid Assessment Interface Discharge (RAID) team then assessed Aleysha. Aleysha continued to refuse to be admitted to hospital and was then assessed to have the capacity to make that decision. In the course of the assessment Aleysha told the mental health nurse that she had self- harmed by cutting herself, although she had not done that recently. That information was not passed to other agencies. Particularly it was not contained in the information subsequently passed to CAMHS nor was it given to Social Services nor Aleysha's school. During the assessment Aleysha stated that she did not then want to end her life but that she had wanted to do so at the time when she had taken the overdose. At the conclusion of the assessment it was determined that whilst Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self harm she was at ongoing risk of impulsive self harm, and arrangements were made for her to have an appointment with CAMHS, despite Aleysha stating that she would not attend. Aleysha was also referred to the Safeguarding Children Team at the Royal Bolton Hospital.

On the 8th of January 2014 Aleysha was seen by her school nurse, who had been informed of her hospital attendance by the Safeguarding team. Aleysha declined further support from the nurse, who did not then contact Aleysha again.

On the 8th of February 2014 Aleysha and her sister were seen to be on the wrong side of the fencing of a road bridge where they were at risk of jumping or falling onto the carriageway below. Police Officers attended, and Aleysha walked off the bridge. She was then detained by the Police under the terms of the Mental Health Act and taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital, where she was seen by two Doctors specializing in psychiatry and an Approved Mental Health Professional who was a social worker, for the purpose of a Mental Health Act assessment. Aleysha did not fully engage during the assessment, and denied that she had intended to harm herself when she had been on the bridge. The assessment concluded that Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self-harm, but that she remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm. Aleysha was then discharged from detention under the Mental Health Act. A further referral was made to the Safeguarding team and to CAMHS, although Aleysha again said that she would not attend at CAMHS, stating that she didn't need it. On the 11th of February 2014 a secretary working for the CAMHS team telephoned Aleysha and offered her an appointment with a mental health practitioner on the 17th of February, which Aleysha refused. On the 18th of February a social worker contacted a mental health nurse at CAMHS in order to share information regarding Aleysha particularly with regard to the events of the 8th of February described above. The ensuing discussion included an acknowledgement of the risks presented to Aleysha as a consequence of her impulsive behaviour when she was with her sister. Aleysha's refusal to engage with CAMHS was also discussed and the Social Worker planned that Aleysha's foster carer should be contacted and asked to encourage Aleysha to attend an appointment with CAMHS. On the 25th of February a multi agency meeting was held by social services to address Aleysha's self harming behaviour and her refusal to engage with CAMHS. CAMHS were not invited to this, nor to any other meeting. It was agreed that in view of Aleysha's refusal to engage with mental health services her foster carer should receive some training as to means of promoting Aleysha's engagement with those services. This training had not been put into place by the time of Aleysha's death on the 3rd of April 2014.

On the 6th of March 2014 Aleysha was excluded from school for five days due to her bad behaviour. A meeting took place with Aleysha and her foster carer and an individual programme of lessons was agreed, so as to support Aleysha during the period leading up to her forthcoming public examinations.

On the 2nd of April 2014 a pupil at Aleysha's school told Aleysha's head of year that Aleysha had self-harmed by cutting her arms. Aleysha's social worker and her foster carer were informed and when they saw Aleysha an ambulance was summonsed and Aleysha was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital with her foster carer following. When Aleysha was treated she was found to have twenty-nine recent lacerations on her left arm, together with scarring from older wounds. Neither Aleysha's foster carer nor Social Services had previously been aware that Aleysha was self-harming to this level. Whilst Aleysha's wound were being closed the treating nurse asked Aleysha if she wanted to see anyone from the RAID team, but Aleysha declined. Despite this the nurse contacted the RAID team and a mental health nurse assessed Aleysha. The assessment concluded that on this occasion Aleysha's self-harm was not an acute incident of attempted suicide but that Aleysha remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm. The means of treating this risk was ongoing psychological therapy such as was offered by CAMHS and the nurse conducting the assessment encouraged Aleysha to attend CAMHS despite her expressed reluctance to do so.

At about 3pm on the 3rd of April 2014 Aleysha was found deceased by her foster carer at their home address [REDACTED]. She had hanged herself. Prior to her death she had been researching websites relating to suicide and hanging. She had also taken amphetamine, which could have induced depression.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

Evidence was given at the Inquest that self harm in young people is becoming a public health crisis. Evidence revealed that 3 out of 10 young people have self harmed at some time during their lives. Accordingly the matters of concern revealed were as follows:-

(1) That it should be considered that the system of training for those working with young people, including teachers, school nurses, foster carers, social workers, mental health workers and medical nurses and doctors should be reviewed so as to ensure that these professionals should be alert for signs of self harm and should take opportunities to discover themselves so that those harming themselves can be offered help and support. By way of example evidence was given at the Inquest that the annual health check offered to looked after children did not include a blood pressure check. If a blood pressure check was included this would provide an opportunity for signs of self harm to be revealed.

(2) That it should be considered that additional information and encouragement could be offered to young people to inform those able to help for example teachers, nurses, health professionals etc. when a young person becomes aware that another young person is self harming. The shocking self harm to which Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had subjected herself was only revealed when a school friend brought it to the attention of a teacher. There was no evidence that there was any system in place to encourage the passing of such information.

(3) That it should be considered that systems such as those now being developed in Bolton should be further developed so as to ensure that multi agency discussions involving all relevant agencies are held urgently for those at risk of self harm and particularly for those who do not engage. Evidence was given that meetings concerning Aleysha Martine Karle McLoughlin did not include the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services although evidence was given that their input would have been valuable.

(4) That it should be considered that a particular pathway of help for young people who resist engagement should be developed. There was no evidence that any such formal pathway had been shared at the present time.

(5) That a review of the capacity of the agencies involved in helping young people who are self harming to address those matters appropriately should be considered."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows :-

1. Although a ""safety plan"" is prepared by CAMHS at the time of discharge from hospital, there does not appear to be sufficient input to this document by DSS with the result that those caring for a young person at risk may have incomplete written information available to them to properly ensure the safety of the young person.
2. A delay in scheduling an appropriate meeting of Professionals resulted in a missed opportunity to provide support and protection of a young person at risk and there was not therefore a prompt response to a crisis
3. The decision to close the case (and then not to reopen the same) by DSS resulted in there being no further assessments conducted at a time when action should have been taken and could have resulted in additional support for the deceased and her family. Such a decision may not have been made if the case had been reviewed by a senior staff member who was not directly involved in the investigation."
