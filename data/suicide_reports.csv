The inquest has not yet completed.","Anthony Binfield died as a result of ligature asphyxiation inside his cell on H wing, Houseblock 2, at HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire, at 22.19 hours on Monday 6 March 2023. At 21.23 hours, while undertaking an NPS log check, a prison officer found that Anthony had covered his cell observation panel from the inside. Contrary to the expected policy and guidance in place at the time, the officer left the cell after gaining no response to knocking and returned to the office to collect the inundation unit key. He returned to Anthony's cell and attempted to remove the inundation unit from the door but was unable to do so. He returned to the office again and arranged for a member of the security team to assist him with removing the inundation unit. Eventually, after 11 minutes, the obstruction was moved by officers via the inundation hole, whereupon they discovered Anthony was hanging from a ligature. He could not be resuscitated. There was an 11-minute delay between prison staff learning Anthony was unresponsive to knocking and banging, and subsequently entering his cell. This delay is unacceptable and contrary to local policy and guidance. It will be for the jury to determine whether this delay probably more than minimally contributed to his death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Prison staff failing to manage the covering of cell observation panels in a 2 safe way that is compliant with the policy and guidance issued by the prison over many years. I am taking the exceptional step of writing to you formally before the conclusion of the inquest as I am so concerned by the evidence called to date regarding the custom and practice of officers when discovering obscured cell observation panels at night. There is a dangerous culture of staff assuming the prisoner has obscured the observation panel for privacy purposes or as a form of protest against the regime. This neglects the obvious and very real risk that the prisoner is seeking to harm themselves, without detection. The HMPPS Safety Nudge, issued in February 2018, made clear that cell observation panels are a vital tool in keeping prisoners safe and must be kept clear at all times in order to preserve life. The custom and practice of seeking to visualise the prisoner via the inundation unit hole (and other means, such as the side of the door) has developed over time and is now an embedded culture accepted by many officers as a response to this occurrence. This practice leads to delay in entering the cell, risks lives and is contrary to policy. This is not a new issue for the prison and hence my concern that the prison has failed to tackle this issue over many years. In August 2020, a prisoner died at HMP Lowdham Grange as a result of drug use. When officers conducted a welfare check they found his cell observation panel to be obscured. Contrary to policy and guidance, Prison staff delayed entering the cell while they fetched the inundation unit key to attempt to observe inside the cell. The Prison and Probation Ombudsman made a recommendation to the Prison Director that they should ensure that observation panels are kept clear, and that staff actively challenge prisoners who cover them. In response, the Prison Director issued a notice to staff in January 2021 reminding staff of the need to treat any prisoner as unresponsive if they fail to acknowledge the officer, and to call a code blue. A similar notice was issued in April 2021, reminding staff of the need to perform a dynamic risk assessment and enter the cell in a quick and safe manner when there is no response to asking the prisoner to remove the offending item. The notice was re-issued in November 2021, and after the inquest in approximately April 2023. Despite these multiple notices, a number of witnesses who remain members of staff at the prison (now under HMPPS employ) reported being unaware of the expected procedure when faced with an obscured cell observation panel until attending Anthony's inquest in December 2024. It is clear that the issuing of staff notices has not addressed the problem of prisoners covering their cell hatches, nor the unsafe custom and practice of staff leaving the cell and thereby delaying safe entry. 6"

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2nd Floor Redmond Place, London E20 1JQ 1","On 6 th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Anne Potter, aged 54, (known as “Anne”). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 10 th March 2025. The conclusion of the jury inquest was a short form conclusion of Suicide in box 4. The Jury's answer to 'when, where and how' was recorded in box 3 of the Record of Inquest as follows: “Anne was a 54 year old menopausal woman experiencing a number of stresses in her life. The menopause contributed to her mental health decline and exacerbated her underlying anxiety. On the 27 th September 2002, Anne took an overdose of paracetamol. She was taken to Yeovil District Hospital where she received treatment. She then received daily community mental health support. After found wandering in traffic and absconding from her home, on the 20 th October 2022, she agreed to a voluntary admission to Rowan Ward. She was then detained on a section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. On the 21 st October 2022 this was upgraded to a section 2 detention. On the 24 th October 2022, she was granted her first Section 17 Leave. On the 31 st October 2022, on a walk with a Health Care Assistant, Anne attempted to run into the road. On the 16 th November 2022, due to a number of incidents and no possible community support options, she was upgraded to a Section 3 detention. During her review on the 29 th November 2022, Anne was authorised for Section 17 Leave for an overnight stay at home on the 4 th December 2022. On the 3 rd December 2022 she had a day with her family in Bristol. On the morning of the 4 th December 2022, following staff assessment of Anne, the overnight leave was granted. Anne's family did not receive appropriate information to assist them in keeping Anne safe for an overnight stay. She went home on the 4 th December 2022 and in the morning of the Fifth December 2022 Anne used a key to open the back door, took a car key and drove away. Anne was driving on the Eastbound carriageway of the A303 and at 07:48 she deliberately drove into the path of a HGV tank lorry on the opposite carriageway.” The medical cause of death was recorded as: Ia) Multiple traumatic injuries","Anne first presented to her GP in 2008. During this year she had three separate appointments relating to underlying anxiety and being unable to cope. There was no secondary mental health service involvement, nor was there any prescription of anti- depressants at this time. Anne presented to the GP again in 2014, so six years later. Her presentation at this time was felt by the GP to be a grief/bereavement reaction. From early 2017 up to the end of 2019 there were five separate consultations for gynaecological and/or gastroenterological presentations but despite secondary investigations, no underlying physiological cause was found and the GP felt that there was a high possibility that her tummy and bowel issues were related to her underlying anxiety. On the 18 th December 2020, Anne had her first significant consultation about mental health symptoms. She was extremely anxious and low in mood and stressed with life in general. On the 11 th January 2021 Anne was emotionally fragile, anxious and stressed. This was the first consultation at which menopause (or perimenopause) was mentioned. Given her presentation it would appear that her underling anxiety had been slowly building; possibly since 2008 but much more so since 2017. Anne started taking Sertraline in February 2021 (she was prescribed this in the January but was too anxious about side effects to start taking it). She was also started on HRT. By the end of May 2021 her symptoms appeared to be under control but it was impossibly to know if this was the Sertraline, the HRT or a combination of both. In July of 2021, following consultation with her GP, the dose of Sertraline was titrated down so that by the Autumn of 2021 she had stopped taking this medication altogether. In early September 2022, Anne's presentation declined again and she agreed to re- start Sertraline. On the 27 th September 2022 Anne was at home with her husband when she informed him she'd taken [REDACTED] tablets. This was the first time Anne had done anything like this before and it was very much the start of her acute decline. After discharge from hospital she was seen daily by the mental health team, and declined an admission. On the 20 th October 2022, Anne did agree to a voluntary admission to an acute psychiatric unit. This was after she had been returned home by the police who responded to a member of the public who had called in after finding her wandering in traffic. Anne was detained under section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. She remained detained up till the date of her death; being placed on a Section 2 detention and this was upgraded to a Section 3 detention on the 16 th November 2022. Anne had a devoted and supportive husband and family, who were keen to be involved in her care and recovery; so much so that Anne started taking section 17 leave from the 24 th October 2022 (3 days after she was detained). She would take escorted leave with either the staff or her husband in the local area for a couple of hours (gradually increasing to up to 6 hours at a time). On the 31 st October 2022 whilst out with staff Anne ran into the road and was pulled back by the Health Care Assistant. It was never established what Anne was actually trying to do on this occasion; whether she was trying to harm herself or whether she was simply trying to avoid going back to the ward as she did not like the ward environment and had said that she would rather be at home with her husband. She remained on the ward without leave for three days after this incident. On the 29 th November 2022 an MDT (Multi Disciplinary Meeting) took place. At this meeting section 17 overnight leave was authorised for the 4 th December 2022 on the basis that there had been no incidents of risky behaviour and/or absconding (with the exception of the 31 st October 2022) and since that incident leave between the 4 th and 29 th November 2022 had gone 'well'. Both Anne and her husband were keen for overnight leave and it was felt entirely appropriate to support this wish as part of her recovery. Anne went out for 6 hours on the 3 rd December 2022 to a Christmas market in Bristol with her husband. This leave went well and without incident. Anne appeared brighter; she was showing future planning with her family for the forthcoming Christmas period and was commenting on finding pleasure and enjoyment in things again (the mental health team highlighted her enjoyment at watching Strictly Come Dancing which whilst small, highlighted a departure from her previous anhedonia). Anne was assessed by a mental health nurse prior to her overnight leave on the 4 th December 2022. There were no concerning or alarming features or presentation that would have given the nurse (or the entire mental health team involved in her care) any clinical reason to withhold her planned leave. The entire treating team were all very clear that there was no reason to not “let her out” that day. Her husband came to collect her at just after 10am that morning. He was not given any formal or codified 'Risk Assessment' document, but he had been very heavily involved in his wife's care and treatment every step of the way and so the evidence was clear; even if he had been given such a document it would not have contained any information or details that wasn't already within his knowledge. Overnight the leave appeared to go well. Anne's husband had locked the doors and windows and hidden those keys in a desk drawer. He did not hide the car keys as he did not think for one minute that his wife would take the car. That morning Anne found the back door key in the desk drawer and took the car. She was seen driving erratically by multiple other road users who were travelling eastbound on the A303 that morning. At around 07:48 Anne drove her car into the path of a fully laden HGV tanker travelling on the westbound carriageway. There was nothing the tanker driver could have done to avoid the collision. Anne died instantly of multiple traumatic injuries. It came to light after Anne's death that she had been using her own personal device (mobile or tablet) to access websites pertaining to self harm. It is unknown whether she had accessed the psychiatric unit's wifi or whether she had made searches using her own personal data from her phone provider contract.","4 During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Part 1 (1) Anne was not sent home for her first overnight leave with any codified 'Risk' and 'Safety Planning' document. Whilst it was widely accepted in this case that Anne's husband was well versed and knowledgeable about his wife's risks and the measures that might be necessary to help keep her safe whilst she was at home, not all families are as involved in their loved one's psychiatric care, despite the Trust following the Triangle of Care principles. Whilst families are not mental health practitioners and are not expected to adopt that role within the community there appears to be an opportunity to supply families with a short, codified document dealing with salient points of risks and safety planning when a patient goes for their first overnight leave since being detained. This may equip families with the knowledge to spot signs of declining mental presentation and/or risk and provide them with the knowledge and/or tools to take appropriate steps to assist in safeguarding their loved ones whilst they are in the community. This concern (and any action deemed appropriate by the recipients of this PFD) is not intended to override autonomy of the patient and their own ability/responsibility to keep themselves safe, but the concern centres around their being an opportunity to assist families in spotting early warning signs that 'something is wrong' and to seek help and intervention (if/when appropriate) to minimise the risk of a patient taking their own life whilst in the community. (2) It transpired during the Inquest that if an in-patient (detained or voluntary) accesses the secure unit Wi-Fi there are no algorithms or 'search detection features' to prevent access to websites pertaining to self harm and so these can be readily accessed by a group who are already vulnerable due to their acute mental health presentation with some element of inherent risk of suicide. It was noted, quite rightly, by legal representatives that workplace organisations can block access to certain sites they deem it undesirable for their workforce to access (such as sites relating to gambling, sexually inappropriate content etc) which shows that it is possible to limit access to certain websites and content when using a Wi-Fi provider. By allowing an already vulnerable group to have unfettered access to websites dedicated to self harm creates a risk of further deaths. Part 2 (3) I am (and remain, having previously issued a PFD in a similar vain on the 26th June 2024) concerned about the lack of 'importance' given to menopausal care available to women on the NHS; especially when compared to private sector meaning that women who are not fortunate enough to be able to access private clinics and facilities may not be able to access the services and expertise they need at a very crucial transitional phase in their lives. Menopause is not a lifestyle choice, it is an unavoidable part of a woman's natural biological cycle. Without wishing to introduce sweeping generalisations, menopause is likely to affect 50% of the population at some point in their lives [according to Statistics Times, women made up 50.75% of the UK population in 2024]. I am concerned that: (i) Certain elements of medicine and clinical practice training are compulsory but having heard evidence at the Inquest around mandatory and statutory 5 training modules I learnt that this covers areas such as GDPR training and disposal of sharp objects such as syringes. I was surprised to learn that menopausal training is not mandatory in any area of clinical practice or specialism. I am concerned that there is no requirement to undertake essential compulsory menopausal training for those working in 'relevant' clinical practices such as Mental Health Practice, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Oncology, or even general as a general GP. (ii) I was told that the Trust has just one 'menopause specialist' (a GP) who covers the entire Trust operations. Not all GP surgeries have a menopause specialist practitioner (or access to one) despite a GP usually being the first port of call for women in the community when seeking primary care. Those GP Surgeries who do have a practitioner who acts as a 'specialist' is often a GP with a personal interest who has taken the initiative to go on courses and broaden their learning and understanding, rather than any mandatory requirement for a Surgery [or group with multiple surgeries] to have an available community 'front-line' specialist. I was told that the Trust does not have an “expert” in this field and it would be difficult to have one as menopause isn't a disease or an illness. Whilst I do not dispute that is it not a disease, menopause is a condition; it does have symptoms and it does have recognised presentations, yet there appears to be a failure to recognise this condition as having equal importance to other ailments or diagnoses. I was told during a previous PFD Response relating to menopausal knowledge and care within the NHS that “It is important to ensure that women understand common symptoms such as anxiety, stress and depression which they might experience during the menopause and where and when to seek help. The NHS website has resources….” This emphasises my concerns entirely; the lack of importance given to menopausal symptoms. If someone has concerns about heart disease, a worrying lump, a broken bone etc they expect to be able to consult a medically qualified professional who has a knowledge and understanding of their condition or presentation and can diagnose and treat accordingly; not just [and I paraphrase] 'have a look at a website to help'. I appreciate that each and every woman will experience perimenopause and menopause differently, their individual experience is unique to them and this, to some degree, creates difficulties as a 'one size fits all' approach (which is perhaps achievable in other medical specialisms and disciplines) cannot be offered, but the lack of recognition of the importance of this condition remains a significant concern. I had previously been told (back in a 2024 PFD response) of a roll-out of specialist menopausal care and upskilling of GPs but there was little evidence during the inquest that this has happened/is happening and women continue to approach and navigate the menopause without the support of expert clinicians or practitioners who understand and can treat the symptoms they are experiencing. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of a three-day inquest on the 3 rd April 2025. Mrs Sitch died at Broomfield Hospital, Court Road, Chelmsford, Essex. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a [REDACTED] overdose . My Narrative Conclusion confirmed that Mrs Sitch (hereafter 'Linda') had taken her own life on a background of the impact upon her emotional and mental health well-being of looking after her elderly husband (with whom she had shared a long and happy marriage) and who, himself, suffered from significant on-going mental and physical health problems. The Narrative Conclusion included a summary chronology of the involvement of Adult Social Care with Linda over the last six weeks or so of life. During my summing-up, when providing my findings and determinations, I made it clear that the failings identified in the course of the inquest, although very possibly contributed to the death, I did not find, in the specific circumstances, that they were probably more than minimally causative of the death.","Linda's husband had been suffering from significant physical and mental health challenges for more than a year or so prior to her death; the impact of aspects of his initial presentation deeply affected Linda, to the extent that she attempted to take her own life on three occasions in October 2022. This led to her admission as a voluntary in-patient at a Mental Health facility under the care of Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT). She received a diagnosis of an 'Adjustment Disorder'. She was discharged to the care of the Community Mental Health Team in February 2023 and remained largely stable in her presentation through until the late summer of 2023. Her husband, having himself been detained under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983, was discharged back to the family home in June 2023. On 29 th September 2023 Linda's husband's EPUT Care Coordinator raised an Adult Safeguarding (ASG) concern with Essex County Council's Adult Social Care (ASC) regarding Linda's potential (unintentional) maladministration of her husband's medication. The referral contained details of Linda's own history of overdosing and the concerns of family members relating to Linda's presentation and her ability to care for her husband. By the time of her death on 11 th November, no action had been taken by ASC regarding this Safeguarding referral. On the 2 nd October 2023 a further referral was received from the same CPN requesting a Care Act (2014) Carer's Assessment for Linda. The referral again informed ASC that Linda was struggling with caring for John. Without apparently considering the ASG referral, this further referral was subsequently erroneously downgraded by the Community Team Manager from Priority 1 (requiring an immediate response) to Priority 2 (response within 28 days). The rationale for so doing was not recorded, as it should have been. By the time of her death no further action had been taken by ASC regarding the referral for a carer's assessment. On 16 th October further contact was made by Linda's daughter chasing up the 2 nd October referral, re-emphasising the escalating and serious family concerns regarding Linda's presentation, reiterating that Linda had attempted suicide the previous year and expressing concerns that Linda was exceptionally stressed and needed a break. As a consequence of (admitted) human error this information was not acted upon. Had it been reviewed the priority level would have been changed back to Priority 1 and there would have been immediate action, within 24 to 48 hours. Options would likely have included, inter alia , interim carers or residential respite. This would also have been an opportunity to establish if Linda had need in her own right. By the time of her death no further action had been taken by ASC regarding this additional contact . On 7 th November Linda's husband was admitted to Hospital for a medical issue; he was due to be discharged the following week. Prior to his discharge home, Linda took her own life.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern and in my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 3 a. Although not determined to be probably causative of the death, by the date of Linda's death ASC had failed to respond substantively or at all to the Adult Safeguarding Referral dated 29th September 2023; the referral for a Carer's Assessment for Linda herself, received by ASC on 2nd October 2023; the concerns reiterated by Linda's family when chasing the 2nd October referral on 16th October 2023. These failures were explained as 'human error'. b. The oral evidence of the ASC Service Manager at the inquest (though not mentioned in her statement prepared for the purposes of the inquest), confirmed that the Team Manager responsible for downgrading the Priority 1 status of the carer's assessment referral on 2nd October to Priority 2, without recording a rationale, had likely done so without undertaking the required consideration of either the readily available ASG referral of the 29th September, or the Mental Health Act assessment of Linda herself from the previous year. She agreed that, had an estimated “ten minute” review of the “slim files” for both Linda and her husband been undertaken, as should have happened, the Priority level could not and would not have been reasonably downgraded. She accordingly accepted that, in fact, (and contrary to her witness statement) the decision to downgrade to Priority 2 was capable of being determined, by her as an ASC Service Manager, to be 'inappropriate'. c. Nonetheless, the ASC Service Manager remained personally “reassured” that a change in Team Manager - along with reminders to personnel of best practice - had sufficiently addressed issues identified by the inquest proceedings. d. In contrast to this view, I remain concerned that ASC continues to lack a robust system to ensure sufficiently rigorous oversight, including active auditing, capable of identifying the kind of sub-optimal managerial level performance as has been brought to the fore in this case. A change in personnel and moves towards “embedding best practice” do not, in my opinion, sufficiently address this systemic lacuna given that the effectiveness of such changes will still rely very substantially upon the performance of any Team Manager and/or a Deputy Team Manager. There appears to me to be a continuing lack of robust Service level oversight of those managers themselves, (including the appropriateness of their decision making), absent which any sub-optimal performance by said managers may well not be identified. e. Absent a sufficiently robust system for providing oversight and identifying and significantly mitigating (if not entirely removing) such individual human error, alongside, for example, the inclusion of simple auditable check lists of matters to be accessed, reviewed and documented whenever a referral is received, then there is a continuing risk of urgent future referrals being inappropriately graded as Priority 2 (and/or being downgraded from Priority 1) without the requisite thorough and 4 professional review, adequately documented, being undertaken. This gives rise to a concomitant risk of future deaths. 6"

Chief Executive, South West London and St Georges Hospitals NHS Trust 1","On 30 August I opened 2023 an investigation into the death of Jonathan Mark George Hamer DOB 7 August 1991, age 32. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 March 2025. Medical cause of death – 1a Head Injury The Conclusion was as follows:- Suicide","Jonathan had been under the care of mental health services for many years and was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, for which he was prescribed medications and was under the community mental health team. He was living in supported housing but decided to seek alternative accommodation, also supported, towards the end of 2023. After this was facilitated, a new placement confirmed and his notice period served, he changed his mind but had to proceed with the move during March 2024. He was unhappy in his new accommodation and only stayed for a short number of days, spending time instead with his mother at her home. There were some gaps in his community mental health care due to staff leave and illness in early 2024, although he was seen during March and April. By 16 April he was not responding to telephone calls. At the time of his death he was not taking any of his prescribed medication. On 24 April 2024 he took his life by going onto the tracks in front of a train at [REDACTED], having sent his mother a text message confirming his intentions.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. There were communication difficulties experienced by Jonathan's family and his supported housing with the community mental health trust responsible for his ongoing healthcare during the early part of 2024. Telephone calls and text messages were unanswered and there was no communication to confirm that in fact the care co-ordinator had a period of annual leave followed by an unplanned period of sick leave. It was unclear at inquest if service users and their support network had been provided with details of any service changes and current up to date contact details. This meant that important information was not being received by the community mental health team. 2. The community mental health team actively encouraged communication by text message and emails but had no system in place to intervene when the care co-ordinator was not at work and had left no “out of office” message. There was no system to return or redirect incoming calls or messages so these remained unread and unanswered. Those initiating the communication were unaware that the information was not being received or actioned by the Trust. 3. Jonathan's case was not “zoned” that is, given a priority coding on the case management system. Therefore, there was no expected period for case review or regularity of expected contact. The multi-disciplinary meetings and supervision meetings when Jonathan's case was discussed failed to recognise and address this issue. Appropriate zoning and regular reviews are a fundamental part of mental health care and should be embedded and prioritised as part of each patient's care planning. 6"

South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust 1,"On 21 March 2023, an inquest was opened, and an investigation commenced, into the death of Christopher McDonald, who was aged 41 at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, which was heard over 7-days between 17 and 25 March 2025, with a jury. The inquest engaged the enhanced investigative obligation under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The medical cause of death was: 1a Ligature strangulation; and 2 Schizoaffective disorder. The conclusion of the jury as to the death was that Mr McDonald died by strangulation by a ligature that he applied around his neck, but the evidence did not enable them to say what his intentions were. The following matters were recorded in the narrative conclusion: (1) There were shortcomings in the decision-making in relation to the suspension of Mr McDonald's section 17 leave on 24 February 2023, which possibly contributed to his death. The shortcomings were a lack of an individualised assessment and a failure to follow the “AWOL – Missing and Absent Persons Policy”. Had a member of the National Psychosis Unit (“NPU”) accompanied Mr McDonald back to the ward on 25 February 2025, it is possible that this may have mitigated any potential distress. (2) There was avoidable delay in the identification of the ligature by NPU staff. Had the NPU staff communicated Mr McDonald's medical history to London Ambulance Service staff, it is possible the ligature would have been discovered and removed in the first instance, possibly increasing his chances of successful resuscitation.","Christopher McDonald was pronounced dead at 14:28 on 26 February 2023 at Bethlem Royal Hospital, National Psychosis Unit. Mr McDonald had a history of mental ill-health and had been formally detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 since 14 November 2020. Mr McDonald was admitted to the Fitzmary 2 Ward of the NPU at Bethlem Royal Hospital on 7 July 2022. His diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. After Mr McDonald went AWOL on 24 February 2023, there is no evidence of an assessment of whether it was appropriate to permit Mr McDonald to remain at his mother's address until Sunday 26 February 2023. In reference to section 10 of the Awol – Missing and Absent Persons Policy, v. 10, there is no evidence of an action plan being drawn up by SLAM staff and the police. No member of NPU staff accompanied the police to escort Mr McDonald back to the ward. When Mr McDonald returned to the ward on 25 February 2023, his level of observation should have remained intermittent, but there is no evidence of it being reviewed. There is no evidence of any observations between 12:15 and 9pm on 25 February. Mr McDonald was reviewed by the duty doctor at 16:50. There is no evidence of any discussion of observation levels. Section 17 leave was suspended pending review by the ward consultant. At 13:30 on 26 February 2023, Mr McDonald was found unresponsive. The NPU staff started an emergency response but did not find the ligature around Mr McDonald's neck. The LAS staff were not informed of Mr McDonald's history of suicidal ideation involving ligature. A senior LAS paramedic identified and removed the ligature between 1:50 and 1:55pm. Artificial ventilation was not applied by the ward staff because of the use of a non-rebreathe oxygen mask rather than a bag-valve mask. Due to the continued presence of the ligature it was not possible to administer successful CPR.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that staff working on the NPU did not have knowledge or a clear understanding of the “AWOL - Missing & Absent Persons Policy” of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (“SLAM”) Specifically: (1) Whilst there should be an individualised assessment of whether it is appropriate to suspend section 17 when a patient goes AWOL: (a) one member of staff at the inquest gave evidence that it was “standard practice” and “protocol” that leave would be suspended; and (b) there was no evidence of any individualised assessment in Mr McDonald's case. (2) The policy provides that SLAM staff should always accompany the police if the patient is to be returned from their home. This was not done in this case, and there was no evidence that any member of NPU staff considered this once Mr McDonald was located at his mother's address on 24 February 2023. (3) The policy provides that if the police are likely to be involved in returning the patient to hospital then an action plan – jointly drafted between the police and Trust staff - needs to be drawn up. This was not done in this case, and there was no evidence that this was considered or completed by SLAM staff. 6"

This was particularly apparent when mental health staff were seeking an interpreter at short notice for a patient who was in crisis. The lack of interpreters available has meant that urgent assessments are being carried out with no interpreters present. The overall lack of British Sign Language Interpreters has also meant that this Inquest has itself had to be delayed/adjourned for two months due to there being no available Interpreters to interpreter for two deaf witnesses over the two week period of the Inquest. 6

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

1. The inquest heard evidence that Mr Pickett had a history of mental health issues and received an online diagnosis of ADHD from a private service provider (which prescribed Mr Pickett with medication too). Following his diagnosis Mr Pickett was admitted into an NHS hospital having taken an overdose. In their discharge letter the hospital suggested that the ADHD medication should not be recommenced. This information was not provided to the private ADHD provider which continued to prescribe Mr Pickett with ADHD medication.

I am concerned that there are no current guidelines governing communication and information sharing as between private psychiatry providers offering assessment, care and treatment in relation to neurodiversity and NHS services involved with providing care and treatment in parallel."

Chief Executive Officer of Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, , Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, The Lodge, Lodge Approach, Runwell, Wickford, SS11 7XX 1","On 31 st October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of DARREN NEIL TURNER, aged 37 years. The investigation concluded at the end of a 9- day article 2 non-jury inquest on the 28 th February 2025. Darren Neil Turner was found deceased on 20 th October 2023 in a wooded area in Essex. The evidence disclosed that the deceased likely took his own life on the morning of the 18 th October 2023. The medical cause of death was confirmed as '1a Hanging'. In a narrative conclusion I recorded that the deceased took his own life in the context of multiple failures in the care, management and treatment provided to him by the Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) and that those serious failings amounted to neglect.","On the 23 rd September 2023 after concerns were raised that Darren, at his home address, was threatening to take his own life having consumed a potential overdose of medication whilst intoxicated with alcohol, the East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST) and Essex Police attended and attempted to facilitate a medical assessment of Darren. He would not consent to such an assessment and EEAST staff, deeming him to have mental capacity, and Essex Police, left him at the property. The following day, whilst apparently experiencing a serious mental health crisis, Darren caused extensive damage, and set fire, to the home he had shared with his former long-term partner, in what was an attempt to end his life. He was arrested and detained under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 1983 and, following an assessment, was subsequently detained under Section 2 of the MHA and admitted as an in- patient to Gosfield Ward, an Acute Psychiatric Unit at the Lakes Mental Health Unit, Colchester, Essex under the care of EPUT on 26 th September. Although Darren had no significant previous recorded history of mental health problems, he did have a history of alcohol misuse which had worsened over the two to three years preceding his death whilst working from home as a consequence of the Covid pandemic. A trigger for events in September 2023 appears to have been the ending of his long-term relationship, itself a consequence of Darren's drinking. The evidence disclosed multiple significant failings in the care, management and treatment of the deceased up to and including the rescinding of his Section 2 MHA detention and subsequent discharge from Gosfield Ward at around 2 pm on the 17 th October 2023. These failings, individually and cumulatively, more than minimally contributed to his self-inflicted death by hanging within some 18 hours or so of the rescinding of the Section 2 detention and Darren's discharge. Taken together, the causative failures identified during the course of the inquest constituted gross failures and, accordingly, led to a finding that neglect contributed to Darren's avoidable death.",": A significant number of the serious causative failings identified in this case have previously informed PFDRs issued to EPUT. In June 2024 a 'Thematic Analysis' Review Document prepared by EPUT's 'Lessons Team' identified 'Triangulated Themes' from a review of nine PFDRs issued in the Essex Coronial jurisdiction between June 2021 and January 2024. The Review acknowledged six 'Triangulated Themes' in respect of which failures causative of deaths had been, and continued to be, identified, namely: Communication; Training & Supervision; Record Keeping; Discharge Planning; Care Planning; Risk Assessment. (Further PFDRs issued to EPUT in October 2024 and February 2025 raised similar, related concerns). During Darren's inquest continuing failings under precisely the themes identified emerged once more as having informed the serious causative features contributing to Darren's death. In my opinion, the actions taken by EPUT to date to address the acknowledged failings reflected under the themes referred to have been, and remain, inadequate and incomplete; Accordingly, during the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern and, in my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 3 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (a) Failures in Care Planning: specifically, a failure to appropriately up-date and document matters relating to Darren's Care Plan consistent with Trust policy. The last up-date to his Care Plan was 12 days prior to discharge. (b) Failures in Documentation: in a number of acknowledged respects the electronic records were inadequate - and inconsistent with EPUT policy - with evidence of the 'cutting and pasting' of entries including Darren's initial 72-hour care plan containing details of another patient entirely. (c) Failures in Risk Assessments: specifically, failures to appropriately up- date and document matters relating to Darren's risk assessment consistent with Trust policy. Relevant passive and active risk factors were not formally reflected in his documented risk assessments. Evidence from his Responsible Consultant Psychiatrist and the discharging Psychiatrist confirmed that, had they been aware of a disclosure made by Darren to his key worker/nurse prior to discharge, the Section 2 detention would not have been rescinded, he would not have been discharged on the 17th October and, accordingly, it is likely that he would not have taken his own life the following day. (d) Failure to allocate a Care Coordinator as required under the Care Programme Approach (CPA) and as mandated by EPUT policy. This failure (resulting from significant human error not detected by an insufficiently robust system and not therefore corrected prior to the death - and in respect of which no DATIX was ever raised) was a feature that contributed to the serious failure in discharge planning in this case. (e) Failures in Communication including a failure to appropriately liaise with the deceased's Family and, specifically, Darren's mother to establish the suitability and safety of a discharge to her address not least in the context of Darren's disclosure that discharge to his mother's home might “make him feel worse” at a point in time that he later acknowledged “would be overwhelming” for him. (f) Failures in Discharge Planning and Execution: specifically, in addition to the features above, a failure to actively reconsider the safety of the discharge on the afternoon of the 17th October in light of the disclosure from Darren's mother that she would not, as had been previously indicated, be able to either collect Darren from the Ward or be at her home when he was discharged. There was no evidence of how, in fact, Darren even left the Unit. It is likely that the chaotic and unsupported nature of Darren's discharge from Gosfield Ward, also in breach of Trust policy, more than minimally contributed to his death some 18 hours after discharge. 6"

The medical cause of death was: 1a Asphyxia 1b Combined Drug Toxicity and Neck Ligature and Submersion II Selective Serotonin Inhibitors Withdrawal The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide,"Rhiannon Auriol Mary Williams was age 24 at the time of her death. Rhiannon was an exceptionally bright, talented and creative person who excelled academically and who was loved and supported by her family. Rhiannon's mental health deteriorated at a time when she suddenly stopped taking SSRI medication and a result, she experienced withdrawal symptoms which caused anxiety. Rhiannon was also concerned that she may have autism spectrum disorder, and her counsellor documented that she was displaying traits of this disorder. For at least a year prior to her death and possibly longer Rhiannon experienced suicidal thoughts. From May 2023 Rhiannon's suicidal thoughts and distress worsened although the full extent of Rhiannon's thoughts and distress was kept hidden from her family. In the months before her death Rhiannon started researching websites relating to suicide and in the month of her death, Rhiannon undertook a Tik Tok search of 'drowning in the bath'. On 15 September 2023 Rhiannon accessed a website called [REDACTED]. This website describes itself as a community that discusses mental illness and suicide from the perspective of suicidal people, as well as the moral implications of the act itself and actively encourages people to commit suicide. It also encourages individuals to hide their thoughts and actions from their loved ones. There is no moderation of this website. Rhiannon used this website to download a detailed document entitled '[REDACTED] guide' which describes in detail how to use these medications to bring about death. There is evidence that Rhiannon used the internet to obtain [REDACTED]. There is also evidence that Rhiannon had written down and practised the method that she eventually used on the day of her death – information also likely obtained from the above website / social media. On 16 September 2023 Rhiannon was found [REDACTED]. Toxicology findings confirmed the presence of [REDACTED] at an elevated level which would have had a sedatory effect and likely impairment of Rhiannon's respiration.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows – Rhiannon accessed an online 'suicide forum' where she was able to access information on how to take her own life and where she obtained advice/information on misleading professionals and her family as to her thoughts and intentions. Rhiannon also accessed a social media platform to obtain information about the method Rhiannon used to take her own life. A similar concern was raised by Patricia Harding Senior Coroner for Central and South East Kent in a Prevent Future Death report of 2019 raising a similar concern in respect of 'suicide forums'. The response from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport of 14 January 2020 referred to The Online Harms White Paper. I am aware of The Online Safety Act 2023 and also BBC reporting -https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67082224 - touching upon whether this Act is in fact sufficient to deal with the risks posed by 'suicide websites'. I am concerned about the risk to life posed by the website and social media platform considered in this inquest and so draw them to your attention. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 th February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical cause of death1a Suspension","Sean Higgins had a long history of mental health issues and substance abuse. His exact diagnosis was a matter of differing opinion between clinicians but alternative diagnoses included paranoid schizophrenia, drug induced psychosis and personality disorder for which he was prescribed antipsychotic and anti-anxiety medication. In 2019 he was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and in 2021 he was transferred to HMP Rochester. Between September 2022 and August 2023 he had been placed on ACCT procedures on five previous occasions whilst at HMP Rochester after concerns of self-harm were raised including after making ligatures. The inquest investigated the last few months of his life when he finished psychological therapy and was removed from the mental health team's caseload. Coincident with this but not apparently because of it he started to self isolate and was managed under CSIP procedures. In December 2023 he stopped taking his medication. His mental health deteriorated. In early January 2024 an ACCT was opened when the deceased was discovered with a ligature [REDACTED]. The ACCT remained open for the whole of January, with six reviews being held. The mental health team did not attend any of the reviews, although they provided a verbal contribution for one which did not contain relevant information from which an accurate risk assessment could be made. The ACCT was closed without the support actions being completed (which included the prisoner engaging with the mental health team) and without consideration of the available documentation. The Custodial Manager and supervising officer on the wing who were responsible for closing the ACCT had been sent emails echoing that which was in the ongoing record that the deceased was hallucinating and was talking of hanging himself which they had not read. There were multiple failures follow policies for both the prison and mental health staff. The deceased fashioned a ligature [REDACTED] six days later and left a note stating his mental health was torture. He had not received medication for 45 days and had not seen anyone from the mental health team for over two months.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Although HMP Rochester had addressed many of the concerns raised by the PPO in advance of the inquest, evidence was given at the inquest that some officers chairing reviews did not read relevant documentation beyond the last ACCT review prior to the review taking place. Although they additionally looked at the last CSIP review where the processes were running in tandem, they did not read the ongoing record or Nomis case notes and were unable to conduct an accurate assessment of risk as a result (2) Some of the officers chairing reviews did not understand how to complete the support plan paperwork such that the ACCT was closed when some of the support plans had not started or had not been completed 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5th March 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Jean Pike was a vulnerable women aged 54 at the time of death and had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and suffered from a depressive illness. Jean resided in supported accommodation and was under secondary mental health care. In the three months prior to her death Jean's mental health deteriorated and she engaged in serious self-harm to manage her suicidal thoughts. At this time all those involved with Jean knew she was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was expressing an intention to hang herself and was impulsive. Jean had two hospital admissions in the three weeks before her death and during this time support staff at Jean's accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator were clearly communicating to the acute hospital where Jean was admitted on both occasions that they could not keep Jean safe in the community in her supported accommodation and that they were concerned that Jean was going to hang herself. Seven days before Jean's death a decision was taken by a consultant psychiatrist to discharge Jean from hospital nine hours after she had been admitted and at time when Jean was still actively experiencing suicidal thoughts. This decision was taken without any consultation with the professionals involved with Jean and there was no risk assessment of Jean's risk of suicide undertaken by the consultant before Jean was discharged. I find that these actions including the decision to discharge Jean from hospital constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. On the day of her death Jean experienced a 2 mental health crisis at her supported accommodation and was threatening to hang herself. This was known to support staff at Jean's supported accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator but despite this an inadequate safety plan was put in place to safeguard Jean. Jean was left unattended for between 20 – 45 minutes during which time Jean took her own life by hanging. I find that the failure to put in place a robust safety plan and leaving Jean unattended constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. I find that Jean took her own life and that she intended to do so, and that Jean's death was contributed to by neglect. 4",On 18 May 2022 Jean Pike was stating that she was suicidal and intending to hang herself. Jean Pike was left unattended and unobserved for between 20 – 45 minutes. Jean Pike was then found suspended in her supported living accommodation on 18 May 2022 and declared deceased at 14.27.,"During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. I am concerned that Jean was discharged from Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital on two occasions shortly before her death by a consultant psychiatrist and that prior to the decision to discharge on both occasions there was no multi-disciplinary meeting between the consultant on Ward F and the professionals directly involved in caring for Jean in the community about Jean's mental health and the risks she posed to herself in the community. This was in circumstances where the consultant knew before the decisions to discharge that these professionals, which included Jean's care co- ordinator, were clearly stating that they were extremely concerned about Jean's mental health and that they did not consider that they could keep Jean safe in the community and that they thought that Jean would hang herself in the community – which is in fact what happened in this case. I am particularly concerned by the evidence I heard from Jean's care co-ordinator that care co-ordinators are rarely if ever consulted by consultant psychiatrists in Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital before a decision is made to discharge a patient/person under secondary mental health care. This issue was not identified by Swansea University Bay Health Board ('SUBHB') in their internal investigation into Jean's death. This investigation found that “there is evidence of regular and effective communication between support staff, community staff and hospital staff”. The above finding of SUBHB's internal investigation raises a concern that critical lessons have not being identified and learnt by SUBHB from Jean's death about the importance of multi-disciplinary decision making in clinical care and risk management and the importance of including care co-ordinators and professionals in the community before a decision is taken to discharge a patient from Ward F. This creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. I am also concerned that if there is a lack of clarity or a reluctance in Ward F at the consultant level to engage with care co-ordinators and professionals in the community (and before decisions are made to discharge) there is a risk that the concerns of the professionals managing a patient/person under secondary care will not be adequately considered in the decisions made by Ward F 3 clinicians. This also creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end the inquest on 5 th March 2025 at Coventry Coroners Court. The conclusion of the death of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was that death was “suicide and a narrative” a copy of which I attach to this report.,"Mr GEBRSSLASIE on the 2nd August 2021 was arrested by the police having been removed from a bus in possession of a plank of wood and oddly offering the police money sufficient for bus fare, this and his behaviour , throwing a road sign at officers precipitated his detention in police custody which gave rise to a mental health act assessment and his detention at the Caludon Centre. Part of his medical treatment included antipsychotic medication and sedation following an episode of violence. On 5th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE absconded from the Caludon Centre via a window, however he was located at his home address and returned to the Caludon Centre the next day and remained detained (under the Menal Health Act) on the Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, his behaviour leading staff to provide him with rip-proof clothing. There was an issue with language, involved communications achieved with an interpreter. Over the following days, in the context of medications provided, his mood was now adjudged seemingly more stable and by the 12th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE was allowed his own clothing, rip proof clothing removed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was provide some hospital type pyjamas whist his personal clothing was being washed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was on level 2 observations (every 15 minutes) and having expression a wish to go home it was communicated to him that his discharge from hospital was an ongoing process and not imminent. On 12th August 2021, the body of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was discovered in his bedroom (Bedroom 2) on Sherbourne Ward nearly 3 hours after his last observation. The deceased had a ligature ([REDACTED]) around his neck and was partially suspended from the bedroom door. The Oxevision system camera (part of a research project, to assess whether new non-contact monitoring technology improves quality of care and safety for patients and staff) in the patients' rooms captured the last interactions Mr GEBRSSLASIE has with staff, where upon moments after the bedroom door closed Mr GEBRSSLASIE then proceeded to use the same bedroom door as an anchor point for the ligature.","During the inquest, the evidence and information revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report them to you. The MATTER(S) OF CONCERN are as follows: i. The inquest explored issues such ligature anchor points. ii. It is known (and has been known for some years by the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust) that the top of a door is a “high risk area” for ligatures in particular patients bedroom which have doors that may be locked by patients from the inside and thereby an unobserved patient area. iii. The circumstances of this inquest touching upon the death of Henok GEBRSSLASIE in August 2021 accentuated this point. iv. Such risks carrying with it a clear risk of death. v. Since the incident it was known that door top alarms is “the way forward” as an environmental change that would mitigate such risk and referred to in a serious investigation report in April 2023, this “way forward” expressed in evidence during the inquest. vi. There remains (now 42 months post Mr GEBRSSLASIEs death) no door top alarms on the patient bedroom doors at Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, at the Caludon Centre. vii. The cumulative effect (there 'seemingly' no expediency to physically better mitigate this known environmental high-risk issue) is such that a concern as to future deaths exists as of March 2025. 6."

Although HM Coroner is of the view that there is great merit in talking through difficulties with those in the same industry, I have concerns that Peer Support is not adequate support for those who are suffering severe mental health difficulties and suicidal thoughts. It appears that there is not enough support in the industry as a whole for pilots whose problems escalate beyond the usual stresses and pressures of the job. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Upon the 10th February 2024, at her home address, Andrea Denise Mann was discovered by a member of her family, to be hanging from a noose placed around her neck [REDACTED]. Mrs Mann was released from her position, and transported by the Ambulance Service to Bradford Royal Infirmary where she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Despite receiving advanced life support the medical condition of Mrs Mann did not improve. Following discussions between attending clinicians and the family of Mrs Mann, a decision was made to withdraw invasive medical care, with Palliative Care then being provided to her. Sadly, the death of Mrs Mann was certified at the hospital on the 11th February 2024 at 14.44 hours.","Andrea was found by her husband, hanging [REDACTED]. Emergency services attended, CPR commenced and she was admitted to hospital. She was admitted to hospital, but sadly the following day she was weaned from the ventilator, as family felt that she would not wish to continue with ICU invasive therapy if she would not be able to return to her previous level of function. She passed away a few hours later.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

The findings made by myself at the Inquest include the following;
1) That during the period of her involvement with the Community Mental Health Trust between the period 25/04/2023 and 04/12/2023 the care given to the deceased was limited to 2 appointments only within which she was referred back to her GP for medication adjustment which had been seen to be ineffective, and referral to Psychological therapy sessions which had a waiting period of 6 months despite an earlier private consultation having been proved ineffective,
That the frequent requests of the deceased and her family for a Psychiatric appointment had not been provided to her, with the result that the deceased had to seek a private consultation.
2) That no evidence of any overarching management tool existed to provide scrutiny of the care given to the deceased, or measure the success or efficacy of such care, and as such there were many lost opportunities to provide to the deceased and her family sufficient, consistent, controlled and bespoke care."

The investigation concluded with an inquest which I heard on 28th February 2025. A post mortem examination determined Mr Lawless died as a consequence of hanging. At the end of the inquest, I recorded a conclusion of Suicide.","Mr Lawless died having suspended himself by the neck with a ligature. Mr Lawless's mental health had deteriorated in the aftermath of an incident on 18th May 2024 which led to him being found outdoors in Manchester City Centre partially clothed and with a head injury, but with no specific recollection as to what had occurred. Amphetamine was subsequently detected as being present in Mr Lawless's system around this time, which he maintained he had not ingested voluntarily. Police officers attended in response to a 999 call made by a member of the public, and an investigation commenced in respect of the crime of battery / common assault pursuant to s39 Criminal Justice Act 1988. This investigation was later closed following difficulties in establishing contact with Mr Lawless. Mr Lawless had used cocaine prior to his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The court heard evidence from a Detective Sergeant from Greater Manchester Police's Professional Standards Branch ('PSB') as to valuable learning which has been identified following her review and critical analysis of the police response to the initial 999 call made on 18th May 2024 and the subsequent police investigation. In the light of this, I am concerned as to the length of time it took for Mr Lawless's death to be recognised by Greater Manchester Police as a Death or Serious Injury within the meaning of s12 Police Reform Act 2002: something which appears only to have occurred after a statement for the purposes of the inquest was requested from a senior officer asked to review previous police contact with Mr Lawless."

The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Amy Marie Padley had a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder ('EUPD') and historically had a diagnosis of depression and is recorded as having problems with an eating disorder and body dysmorphia. From the age of 16 and then for many years Amy had was prescribed various anti-depressant and other medications. Amy also suffered from a longstanding and harmful addiction to alcohol which escalated closer in time to her death in a context of family divorce and family breakdown. Amy had some limited early involvement with community mental health services when she was young and then had not engaged. In the two years before her death Amy had overdosed twice and had experienced some fleeting suicidal ideation and had been admitted to hospital. Roughly four months before her death Amy had undergone an emergency alcohol detoxification in a hospital setting whilst on the waiting list for alcohol services from a third sector agency. Amy had engaged with a number of third sector agencies in the two years before her death to help with her alcohol addiction, but her engagement had been sporadic, and she often disengaged. Amy had also been offered and turned down appointments to see mental health professionals. Amy was engaged with one third sector agency at the time of her death. Three weeks before her death Amy overdosed on a dangerous level of medication but then felt remorse and expressed plans for the future. Amy had also expressed wanting psychiatric input to assist with overcoming her alcohol addiction. Amy was discharged from hospital after being assessed by Liaison Psychiatry but was not referred to the community mental health team as the view was that Amy first needed to address her alcohol addiction. There were several opportunities that were missed by Swansea University Bay Health Board ('SUBHB') staff to refer Amy to the community mental health team for assessment in the primary care setting including when Amy overdosed on 18 June 2022 shortly before her death. I find that that this was because too much emphasis was placed by SUBHB staff on Amy needing to seek help to first addresses her alcohol addiction with insufficient consideration given to Amy's underlying mental health diagnosis and the role that may have been playing in her mental health deterioration. There was also insufficient attention given to the difficulties Amy faced in engaging with third sector organisations for her alcohol addiction and her inability to consistently seek help for herself and whether this was because of her mental health diagnosis. Amy was known to engage in impulsive and dangerous acts of self-harm and to experience suicidal thoughts when intoxicated and that Amy was suffering from long-standing alcohol addiction. I consider that this posed a risk to her life and that this risk (i.e. life- threatening self-harm when intoxicated and when having suicidal thoughts) was not given sufficient consideration when she was discharged by Liaison Psychiatry three weeks before her death. There were several missed opportunities for mental health services to try and engage Amy before her death so that they could assess her and undertake a medication review. I am unable to say whether these missed opportunities contributed to Amy's death as I do not know whether Amy would have engaged with any appointment that she was offered and whether an assessment would have been arranged and/or had any meaningful impact before Amy took her own life. On the 8 July 2022 Amy was found by her daughter, hanging [REDACTED]. Attending paramedics and Police confirmed the death at 06.50hrs. I am satisfied that Amy took her own life and intended to do so.",The deceased Amy Marie Padley. Amy Marie Padley suffered from alcohol addiction and depression and was diagnosed with an EUPD. On 18 June 2022 Amy overdosed and had an inpatient admission. Amy was then discharged by Liaison Psychiatry with no mental health follow up. Amy was found deceased at her home having taken her own life by suspension and was declared deceased on 8 July 2022 at 06.50.,"During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 The MATTERS OF CONCERN is as follows: I am concerned about the evidence I heard in this inquest that when an individual is suffering from alcohol or drug addiction alongside a mental health diagnosis, which in this case was EUPD and depression, that the focus of SUBHB is normally to advise that individual to address their addiction before they can access mental health services. I heard that addiction services do not fall within the remit of SUBHB and are provided by third-sector agencies. I heard that individuals who have a mental health diagnosis may self -medicate to manage symptoms of a mental health deterioration and that increased use of alcohol/drugs can increase the risk of self-harm to such individuals which may prove fatal. I am concerned that there is no guidance to staff within SBUHB on how to manage individuals with addiction and a mental health diagnosis and how SUBHB staff should liaise with and work alongside third-sector agencies in respect of an individual suffering from addiction. I am also concerned that there appears to be a reluctance within SBUHB to offer mental health support alongside suggesting that an individual access addiction services. I am concerned that this may mean that individuals in mental health crisis and suffering from addiction may not be getting the mental health assessment and support that they require alongside seeking to overcome their addiction and as such there is continuing risk to life. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide 1a Asphyxia 1b Hanging 1c II,"The Deceased hanged himself in his prison cell overnight on 27/28 March 2022. The jury found that this was suicide. He had spoken to his wife at about 2100 hours on 27 March 2022. She believed he was suicidal and likely to take his life. She, and Cambridgeshire Police and the Metropolitan Police, were all unable to contact he prison by telephone to warn them. It later transpired that this was because the calls were being diverted to an unmanned or obsolete number. The Deceased's wife drove from Cambridge to the prison, two hours away. She stood outside the main gate for some considerable time, banging on it, calling out and pressing a buzzer which promised to connect her to an intercom through which she could speak to prison staff. The intercom was out of action and had been for several years. In the result, the Deceased's wife and the police could not contact the prison all night During that night, the Deceased took his life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed the following matter giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. - The buzzer/intercom system must have been provided because it was thought important to provide that additional means of communication between the prison and the outside world. In this case, a working system would have enabled the Deceased's wife to warn the prison of his impending suicide. This could happen again in the future if there was another problem with the telephone system during the night state. It is difficult to understand why the buzzer/intercom system has not worked for several years. There was evidence that it is irreparable. But the proposed solution appeared to be either to leave it as it is (still not working) or to remove it altogether. The jury found that the failure to provide a working buzzer/intercom system was a failure. It is a matter of concern that the prison/the Ministry of Justice still considers that it is unnecessary. 6"

Care Quality Commission 3. NHS England 4. Secretary of State for Health 1,"On 15 th January 2020 an inquest was opened into the death of Mr Paul Timothy Dunne, aged 45, on 02.01.20. On 10th April 2024 I was assigned to investigate this legacy case. The inquest engaged Article 2 ECHR and concluded on 19 h December 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1a Asphyxia. 1b Suspension by neck The conclusion as to his death was recorded as: Mr Dunne committed suicide after absconding from urgent health care in an A&E department. Various failures in health care have contributed to his death: a) Failure of MH nurse at about 22.00 to make an adequate risk assessment and care plan, in particular not instructing 1:1 observations. b) Failure of a MH nurse in Home Treatment Team at 00.45 when he was intoxicated to make a meaningful risk management plan c) Failure of a MH nurse at around 03.00 to record and communicate at the time he finished his observations that Mr Dunne was high risk and required 1:1 observations d) Failure of an A&E triage nurse around 01.40 to escalate a deterioration in mental state when inserting the IV line e) Failure of the nurse in charge in the A&E department to ensure any observations after 03.30, when he was left on his own. Without these failures he would have been supervised, formally risk and capacity reassessed and either detained under the Mental Health Act and/or prevented from leaving and so would not have died when he did.","Mr Paul Dunne had a history of depression, anxiety, episodic alcohol abuse, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and two voluntary admissions to a mental health ward. He was brought to Princess Royal University Hospital A&E department at 20.40 on 1st January 2020, after an overdose of Paracetamol, having been persuaded by his family and emergency services personnel. He was at high risk of suicide and required continuous 1:1 observations, but never had them. There were poor communications between MH staff and A&E staff, exacerbated by separate medical recording. He deceitfully absconded four times whilst in the department, twice purchasing and drinking more alcohol. Security staff were not alerted to his risks. He did not have repeated risk or capacity assessments, nor have a Mental Health Act assessment, despite his circumstances and mental state deteriorating. After removing his IV line, he finally absconded for the final time, which could have been prevented. Police were notified, briefed by the A&E department just before 05.30 and took steps to find him, following their Missing Persons Policy. He was found dead, having suspended himself in the nearby children's playground, at 07.47 on 2nd January.","Many of the failings have been addressed locally. But during the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN addressed to Oxleas and CQC are as follows. – 1. Individual mental health professionals appeared to have gaps in knowledge and judgment. The director who was spokesperson for the Mental Health Trust did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of these deficits.  A mental health liaison nurse, who now is manager of these nurses, did not recognize the patient as high risk, despite his having been persuaded to attend A&E by the police against his will, having just expressed suicidal ideation, made a previous attempt, with alcohol intoxication and absconsion, as at the time he denied suicidality. Even in retrospect in court she did not acknowledge her misjudgement. She also asserted incorrectly that a patient who has mental capacity cannot be assessed under the Mental Health Act.  A mental health nurse of 9 years standing in the Home Treatment Team who acknowledged the risk to the patient's life could hardly be higher, failed to document his assessment, as he could not find anywhere to write it before going on his break. No staff acknowledged that he had informed them of the risk. He assumed the patient would get 1:1 monitoring, but did not direct anyone to the need. When asked what he would have done if he had known there were no staff to conduct 1:1 monitoring, he said that he could perhaps hang around for a bit longer. 2. The Mental Health Trust  Staff and it appears the director even at the time of the inquest did not appreciate that the A&E policies (Missing Persons, Shared Care) which required risk assessment after an absconsion and alerting managers to the need for extra temporary staff if 1:1 monitoring was needed, also applied to MH staff.  Evidence was heard that staff in KCH A&E and Oxleas NH Trust had been trained on different risk assessment documents. Although meetings had been reinstated between departments, there had been no audit of absconsions or MH liaison in A&E. The MATTERS OF CONCERN addressed to NHSE and DH are as follows. 3. MH staff and A&E staff write their clinical records in different systems and hospital staff do not have access to MH Rio records. MH staff attending A&E departments are asked to make a double entry in the A&E records as well. Here that was omitted, potentially with fatal risks. Moving to a combined electronic system (now identified as EPIC) has long been the aim of the local health providers, but evidence was heard that the pace of introduction, which is very slow, is in the hands of national NHS leadership. 6"

Chief Executive Officer North London NHS Foundation Trust St Pancras Hospital 4 St Pancras Way London NW1 0PE 1,"On 2 August 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Duncan Holloway, aged 36 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 January 2025. I do apologise for the late provision of this report. I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide.","Mr Holloway jumped off a bridge at approximately 5am on Thursday, 18 July 2024 and was killed by the impact with the railway tracks below.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. For BCAP: 1. Mr Holloway's BCAP accredited psychotherapist did not make any notes of her consultations with him, because he had asked her not to. She gave evidence that she is not bound by law or ethics to keep any notes. Is it appropriate that there is no minimum standard of note keeping following psychotherapy consultations? 2. The psychotherapist said that she had never before had a client who was suicidal. She said that this is not taught at university, though she had completed a post graduate course in working with suicidal ideation. Can it be right that suicidality is completely omitted from BCAP accredited psychotherapy training? 3. When Mr Holloway's friend contacted the psychotherapist to say that he was missing, knowing that he had neither attended nor cancelled their last consultation the psychotherapist was very concerned for his safety. She instructed the friend to go round to his home, but it did not occur to her to call the police. The friend did this, but can it be right that contacting the police in such a situation is not taught as part of psychotherapy planning? 4. The psychotherapist explained in court that she was angry that Mr Holloway's friend disclosed to her that Mr Holloway had died, asking the friend: “Do you have any idea how this impacts me and my ability to do my job going forward?” The psychotherapist said that she (the psychotherapist) was in distress and shock. 3 In hindsight, the psychotherapist said that she wished she had referred Mr Holloway to a psychotherapist with more experience in suicidality, she said at inquest because she did not want to be in this situation again with this responsibility. Should there be a mechanism of ensuring that a psychotherapist who is unable to deal with suicidality does not practise with clients who may experience this? For BCAP and North West London NHS Trust: 5. Mr Holloway was seen and fully assessed by North West London clinicians when he was taken to hospital by police following an episode of self harm on 30 June 2024. Police attendance had been prompted by Mr Holloway's brother, calling from abroad. Mr Holloway's brother was particularly disappointed that it seemed as if Mr Holloway's care was not joined up between the different agencies. 6"

I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide.","Slightly before 1am on Saturday, 21 September 2024, Ms Beavington jumped from the fifth floor balcony of her home. She had paranoid schizophrenia and long term substance misuse disorder. Following admission to hospital for [REDACTED] toxicity earlier in September, when she was under the mental health care of North London NHS Trust, she was discharged home the day before she died.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. When planning for Ms Beavington's discharge from hospital, it was agreed that the best place for her to go was a local crisis house. Upon application, the foundation year 1 doctor (FY1) was told by the crisis house team that this was not possible because: - Ms Beavington had secure accommodation; and - she was no longer actively suicidal. This was despite the fact that: - there was a strong suspicion that Ms Beavington was the victim of cuckooing in her own home; and - the team view was that she was definitely at risk of suicide. The consultant psychiatrist in charge of Ms Beavington's care did not give the FY1 any instruction as to how to challenge the decision that the consultant believed was wrong. Instead, the consultant instructed the FY1 to leave it for three days and then just try again in the same way. By this time, Ms Beavington decided that she had waited too long and did not want another attempt to be made. Ms Beavington was discharged home and killed herself at 1am the next morning. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 July 2024. The jury made a natural causes conclusion supported by a narrative, which I attach. I drafted this report in early October 2024. However, it was not issued at that time owing to an IT error.","Mr Bainborough lived in supported living accommodation. He had a history of schizophrenia and substance misuse but had been discharged from mental health services in 2022 due to poor engagement. Mr Bainborough was not taking anti-psychotic medication and did not engage with his GP. Mr Bainborough's mental health problems contributed to him being visibly underweight. Attempts were made to assess Mr Bainborough's physical and mental health, but Mr Bainborough refused to engage. Following a failed attempt to informally assess Mr Bainborough under the Mental Health Act on 5 June 2023, it was decided to apply for a warrant under Section 135(1) Mental Health Act so that Mr Bainborough could be detained to enable an assessment to take place. There were significant delays in applying for a warrant for reasons specific to the circumstances of this case. An application for a warrant was submitted to the Magistrates Court on 18 August 2023 and the warrant was granted at a hearing on 23 August. Once a warrant was issued, an appointment was made for police officers to execute the warrant on 7 September 2023. Before the warrant could be executed, Mr Bainborough was admitted to hospital on 29 August 2023 suffering from malnutrition. He had a BMI of around 13. He was detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. The plan was for him to receive physical and mental health treatment in an acute hospital setting until he was physically well enough to be transferred to a psychiatric unit. Mr Bainborough died on 11 September 2023. The medical cause of his death was: 1a) community acquired pneumonia and malnutrition; 1b) anorexia and chronic schizophrenia; 2) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Jury found that the delay in applying for a warrant may have affected the outcome for Mr Bainborough.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) During the Inquest, evidence was heard from 2 consultant psychiatrists and an Approved Mental Health Act Professional (AMHP) regarding the timescales for applying for and executing s135(1) warrants. All of them had concerns about the time taken for a warrant to be issued and executed (2) The warrant application was submitted to the Magistrates Court on 18 August 2023, the hearing took place on 23 August and it was intended that the warrant would be executed on 7 September 2023. This was a timescale of 20 days. The jury was told that this timescale was typical of the time taken to apply for and execute a s135(1) warrant in the experience of the professionals giving evidence at the Inquest. (3) Applications for a warrant are heard at Westminster and Uxbridge Magistrates Courts which consider applications from all 32 London Boroughs. There are a limited number of video hearing slots, so AMPH teams may have to wait several days for a hearing. (4) Once a warrant has been issued, an appointment then needs to be arranged for police officers to execute the warrant. The evidence before the court was that it would generally take in the region of 10 days for an appointment to be scheduled. (5) There is no official fast track procedure. Consequently, there is a risk of harm to the individual and others during the time taken for a warrant to be granted and executed. 3 (6) As individuals have been identified as requiring assessment under the Mental Health Act, the risk of potential harm is recognised. In the absence of treatment, there is an ongoing risk that individuals will harm themselves or others before the warrant can be executed. This includes a risk of fatal harm. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 August 2024. The jury returned a suicide conclusion supported by a narrative, which I attach. I drafted this report in early October 2024. However, it was not issued at that time owing to an IT error.","Mrs Mohamed developed mental health problems after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014. In early 2022, she was suicidal and was detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act in March 2022. She was released from hospital the following month and went to visit family abroad. On returning to the UK in July 2022, she was irrational and paranoid and her children's social worker referred her back to mental health services. Mrs Mohamed was again detained under section 2 MHA on 21 September 2022. Mrs Mohamed's full mental health history was not easily available due to a cyber-attack. On 30 September 2022 Mrs Mohamed was sent on home leave for a week pursuant to Section 17 Mental Health Act. On the evening of 3 October 2022, Mrs Mohamed made a succession of distressed telephone calls to her children's social worker. On 4 October, she sent text messages to her children's social worker threatening to kill her children and expressing the need to return to hospital. Attempts were made to persuade Mrs Mohamed to return to hospital voluntarily but she refused. Over the following days, she expressed suicidal thoughts and threatened to jump from the balcony outside her 5 th floor flat to professionals. The community mental health team was of the view that Mrs Mohammed needed to return to hospital. However, the ward did not apply for a warrant under s135(2) Mental Health Act to return her to hospital and instead asked the community mental health team to persuade her to return to hospital voluntarily. On 12 October 2022, Mrs Mohamed jumped from the balcony. Her death was confirmed at the scene. The medical cause of her death was 1a) Multiple severe traumatic injuries 2) excessive Mirtazapine intake. At the time of her death, the ward had not applied for a warrant to return her to hospital under s135(2) Mental Health Act.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) It was accepted that a s135(2) warrant should have been applied for on 4 October 2022. However, if an application had been submitted to the magistrates' court that day, it is unlikely that the warrant would have been executed before Mrs Mohamed's death. In evidence, I was informed by a number of mental health professionals that the time taken for a s135(2) warrant to be obtained from the magistrates' court and executed by the police was in the region of 2 weeks. (2) The process for obtaining a warrant is that an application has to be made for a video hearing at either Uxbridge or Westminster Magistrates' Courts. It could take several days for a hearing to be arranged as the courts consider applications from all 32 London Boroughs. Once the Magistrates issued a warrant, an appointment would then be arranged for the police to execute the warrant. (3) I was informed that a 2-week timescale for obtaining s135(2) warrants was still the case in the summer of 2024. (4) I also heard evidence that the mental health team could attend Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in person to apply for a warrant in urgent cases but that they were actively discouraged from using this process by the court. (5) The court heard that the process and timescale for issuing and executing warrants had led to the hospital team adopting a practice of asking the community team to encourage a patient to return to hospital voluntarily before making an application for a warrant. (6) There is an ongoing risk that patients will harm themselves or others in the period before the warrant can be executed. This includes a risk of fatal harm. 3 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was 1a Hanging. Suicide: Mr Bennett did not receive an assessment of his mental health deterioration on 1 June or 6 June 2023 when he sought assistance and medication for his mental health deterioration.","David Bennett died due to hanging on 13 June 2023 at [REDACTED] where he was found suspended by a ligature [REDACTED] with ingestion of cocaine and alcohol. Mr Bennett had a history of drug induced psychosis that had been treated in the past with antipsychotic medication. Family raised concerns with the GP who advised to call mental health crisis services about Mr Bennett's safety on 25 May 2023 due to a deterioration in his mental health. The crisis team advised that a person would need to be with Mr Bennett for assessment, there was no follow-up. Mr Bennett's request for medication for psychosis on 1 June 2023 to the primary care mental health services was not actioned or escalated and at the time there was a current prescription of antipsychotic medication on his GP records. Mr Bennett attended the acute Trust emergency department on 6 June and informed staff that the Mental Health Urgent Care Centre was closed. Mr Bennett requested medication for psychosis and lack of sleep. Mr Bennett was not assessed or reviewed by mental health services at hospital and was signposted back to primary care and substance misuse services. Mr Bennett was sent a copy of his GP summary and said he was going to try to access a 'treatment clinic'.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Evidence was heard that the mental health crisis staff do not appear to have appropriate access to the primary care mental health System One records and there is a risk that vital information is not being shared. (2) The Operational Policy Mental Health Urgent Care Department pathways Appendices are not clear and do not appear to accord with the implementation. (3) Recent contact with the primary care mental health records did not appear to be accurately recorded in the System One Records with suicidal ideation not recorded. (4) Mr Bennett requested a GP appointment; a telephone appointment was made with the primary care mental health nurse. The primary care mental health nurse on 1st June did not escalate Mr Bennett to the GP or Community Psychiatrist when Mr Bennett was adamant he wanted to see a doctor and required an urgent medication review for his deteriorating mental health. (5) Mr Bennett had an open prescription for antipsychotic medication on his GP record that was not being requested and the primary care mental health nurse did not ask about this and the nurse did not inform the GP or seek any advice from her line manager who was a nurse prescriber. 3 (6) Mr Bennett attended the acute hospital Trust for his deteriorating mental health. The acute Trust hospital nurse sought advice from the mental health liaison nurse. The acute Trust nurse did not have access to the mental health or GP records and not all available information was shared with the acute Trust nurse. (7) The mental health liaison nurse asked the acute Trust nurse to undertake the risk assessment for Mr Bennett's mental health. This is the role and purpose of mental health liaison. 6

The Chief Executive, NHS England 2. The Chief Executive, Hertfordshire & West Essex Integrated Care Board 3. The Chief Executive, Hertfordshire County Council 1","On 8 March 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Joshua Jay Weavers, aged 17. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest heard by me on 17-19 December 2024 and 20 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide. The medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a. Multiple Traumatic Injuries.","Joshua first came to the attention of mental health services in 2011 due to suicidal ideation and risk-taking behaviour. In October 2017, Joshua went to a railway bridge near his home ([REDACTED]) with the likely intention of jumping from the bridge and ending his life. He was prevented from doing so by family members who pulled him down the edge. Following this incident, Joshua was re-referred to the mental health team. Initially his treatment consisted of medication and therapy. His therapy sessions stopped in early 2019 after this therapist left the Trust. In March 2019, following funding approval, Joshua was referred for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) assessment. Whilst awaiting his ASD assessment, a decision in respect of therapeutic intervention for Joshua was put on hold, pending the outcome of the ASD assessment. Waiting times for ASD assessments are lengthy, and it was not until the autumn of 2020 that a diagnosis was made with the final assessment report being finalised in January 2021, some 22 months after the referral for assessment. The ASD assessment emphasised the importance of therapeutic intervention for Joshua. A therapy assessment was undertaken in January 2021 by the mental health team which confirmed the need for therapeutic intervention, and Joshua remained on the waiting list for therapy. On 4 March 2021, following the breakdown of a relationship, Joshua went to the railway bridge near his home; the same bridge where he attempted to take his life in 2017. At around 11:36hrs, Joshua jumped from the pedestrian section of the bridge, landing on the railway tracks below where he was subsequently struck by a high-speed train resulting in his death. During the inquest I heard evidence from clinicians from the local mental health NHS Trust and the external NHS Trust who undertakes ASD assessments in Hertfordshire. Their evidence was that the aim of ASD assessments was to assist and guide the provision of effective on-going care and/or treatment needs, as well as being a mechanism to facilitate access to other services. The waiting times for such assessments in Hertfordshire is currently 2.5 years, which is broadly in keeping with the national picture, though there is some variation in waiting times. Crucially, I heard evidence that suicidal behaviours are common in children and adolescents with an eventual diagnosis of ASD (occurring in 10%-50% of cases), and that whilst some patients will be under the care of their local mental health team whilst awaiting assessment, some patients are not. I heard evidence from the local mental health NHS Trust that they have plans to bring ASD assessments in-house with the aim of reducing waiting times for ASD assessment in Hertfordshire, together with plans for more robust monitoring of those awaiting ASD assessment. However, whilst detailed plans have been made, implementation of the same awaits input from the local Integrated Care Board, who commission services. I also heard evidence in relation to the current arrangements in relation to safeguarding pedestrians who use the [REDACTED]. The evidence was that on the pedestrian walkway the parapet preventing or discouraging pedestrians from jumping or falling from the bridge is low and therefore does not comply with the current guidance from the Office of Rail and Road in this regard. Further, in relation to the vehicular portion of the bridge, I heard evidence that there is also a pavement for pedestrian use, however, as with the dedicated pedestrian walkway, the parapet and other measures preventing or discouraging pedestrians to jump or fall from the bridge does not comply with current guidance from the Office of Rail and Road.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Page 3 of 4 NHS England 1. That, nationally, waiting times for ASD assessments are very long. Such assessments are important in guiding effective care and treatment, as well as being a potential gateway to access other relevant services. This combined with the fact of an increased risk of suicidal behaviour amongst those who receive a diagnosis of ASD, gives rise to a concern that future deaths may occur on account of the delays in ASD assessment. Hertfordshire Integrated Care Board 2. That whilst the local mental health Trust has plans to reform the manner in which ASD assessments for patients under their care are undertaken, the implementation of those plans awaiting input from the Integrated Care Board. This means that waiting times for ASD assessments in Hertfordshire remain lengthy which in turn gives rise to a risk of future deaths occurring for the reasons set out above. Hertfordshire County Council 3. That the safety measures in place on the to guard against pedestrians either jumping or falling from the bridge do not meet current guidance, and therefore gives rise to a risk of future deaths occurring. 6"

ERYC Highways Department 1,"On 16 th February 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Jason Myles, aged 58 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 31 st January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: SUICIDE","On the morning of 7th February 2024, Jason Myles who was accompanied by his dog, left his house from where he was due to be evicted at noon, in a Mercedes Vito van registration number [REDACTED]. The weather conditions were clear, and the carriageway was dry. His vehicle entered a sharp left-hand bend at excessive speed and made no clear attempt to negotiate it, thereby resulting in a collision with a wall, and thereafter with disused cattle shed. He was not wearing a seat belt and as a result of the impact, he sustained head and chest injuries that were incompatible with life, and he died at the scene. The evidence heard and taken at its highest, indicates that Mr Myles intended to take his own life. The incident occurred on the [REDACTED] East Riding of Yorkshire.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Evidence was heard that over the past 50 years, there have been a number of fatal, as well as non-fatal collisions at this site. The road is known locally as “suicide hill”. Evidence from two witnesses that an improvement in the signage to alert road users to the hill and the sharp turn at the bottom might be of value, particularly is visibility is poor and the topography of the road is not readily apparent. 6"

He died from asphyxiation which arose from the placement of a ligature around his neck. His death was contributed to by a diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder.

I heard the inquest into his death on 24 January 2025 and reached the conclusion of suicide.","Nicholas had long-standing mental health diagnoses and had been detained under the Mental Health Act on several previous occasions. His mood deteriorated at the beginning of 2024. He was admitted to Highgate in early April, after initial failed attempts to improve his mental health in the community setting, through altering his medication. On review by the ward consultant, his background diagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder was queried and a diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder was favoured. He was under 'general observations', meaning that staff were supposed to be monitoring him on an hourly basis. Sadly, on the late morning of the 15 April, he was found in his room with a ligature around his neck. Signs indicated that he died several hours previously. After inspection of CCTV and records of supposed observations, it was apparent that staff had not monitored Nicholas as had been intended. However, it was not possible to conclude that this lack of monitoring contributed to his death.","During the course of this inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In 1 my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Nicholas' death were as follows: 1. I heard evidence that cross-titration of medication, when changing from one regimen to another, is commonplace in psychiatric care but that how to undertake this process is determined predominantly by each individual prescriber's own practice, rather than any local or national guidance. The local psychiatric Trust provided evidence that they were in the process of developing local guidance. However, this was proving to be complicated, owing to the range of settings in which cross-titration may be carried-out (i.e. primary care, community psychiatry care, in-patient care), the complexity of the medications prescribed and a lack of evidence regarding how this should be undertaken. I am concerned that this commonplace and important process is seemingly undertaken on the basis of limited consensus and that the variation in care provided could result in future deaths. 2. I heard evidence that the local psychiatric Trust had undertaken a trial of electronic patient observation (i.e. automated monitoring of respiratory rate, temperature) but that this had been discontinued, owing to patient complaints regarding invasion of privacy. The issue of privacy and electronic monitoring on psychiatric wards is clearly a complex issue. However, in circumstances such as Nicholas' death, I am concerned that the lack of patient observation could result in future deaths. Regarding both of the above concerns, I heard evidence that the Royal College of Psychiatrists has not produced any formal guidance regarding cross-titration and use of electronic monitoring and that decision-making is ad hoc, based on individual/local practice. 6 ACTION COULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action could be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the addressee has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 April 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner, Nicholas' family, the hospital Trust and the CQC. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful 2 or of interest.

The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, heard before a jury, calling evidence on dates between 4 November 2024 and 7 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Anthony, David and Rolandas had all died as a result of self-inflicted ligature asphyxiation, while in state detention at HMP Lowdham Grange, within a 19-day period of one another. The jury found multiple failings and missed opportunities in their care had probably more than minimally contributed to their deaths.","Serco had operated HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire, for 25 years under the provisions of a Private Finance Initiative ('PFI'). When the PFI expired on 15 February 2023, the Ministry of Justice awarded the prison operator contract to Sodexo. This was the first private provider to private provider prison transfer to take place in England and Wales. To facilitate the contract exit and transfer, Serco, Sodexo and HMPPS each established their own mobilisation and transfer team to oversee the project between August 2022 and February 2023. Sodexo assumed operational control of the prison on 16 February 2023. On 6 March 2023, Anthony Binfield was declared deceased inside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was the result of suicide. On 13 March 2023, David William Richards was declared deceased outside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was accidental. On 25 March 2023, Rolandas Karbauskas was declared deceased outside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was the result of suicide. All three men had vulnerabilities and had been in contact with prison and healthcare staff concerning these vulnerabilities in the period shortly before their deaths. There were multiple missed opportunities to have considered the risk pertinent information held within various systems and records when engaging with all three men. The jury found that there were shortcomings in the culture and systems with regards to prison and healthcare services, which contributed to the three self-inflicted deaths. Further, the jury found that the way in which the mobilisation and transfer of the prison contract had been conducted, probably more than minimally contributed to the deaths.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Matters of Operational Concern While the evidence called at inquest relates to HMP Lowdham Grange, these issues are likely to be relevant across the prison estate, and for that reason I highlight my concerns to both the Minister for Prisons and NHS England as commissioners for prison healthcare. 1. Recruitment, retention and training of prison and healthcare staff (response required by the Minister for Prisons and NHSE) Staffing levels I heard compelling evidence from prison and healthcare staff who told me they were overwhelmed, over- burdened and under-supported in their work at HMP Lowdham Grange. I understand from both prison providers (Serco and Sodexo) and the Healthcare Trust (Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust), that recruitment and retention of staff was a persistent challenge, meaning more often than not the staff on shift were required to cover more than their fair workload. This led to low staff morale, higher levels of sickness absence, and an inevitable deterioration in prisoner safety. The inadequate prison and healthcare staffing levels led to a restricted regime and healthcare provision. The prison was unable to offer keywork to all men, and the mental health team could no longer offer a named nurse service. Both of these aspects of care are fundamental to supporting the most vulnerable prisoners. For months prior to the deaths, the Trust failed to fulfil its commissioned obligations to provide a nurse during night state. Prison staff have only basic first aid training and lacked the expertise of a medical professional when attempting to provide CPR to Anthony. Skill mix and experience I am concerned by the failure to retain experienced prison officers and healthcare staff. The private prison operator and the Authority were focused on the number of staff, rather than the skills set or experience of the staffing body as a whole. One PCO told me that he was considered the most senior on shift in the houseblock with less than 2 years' experience of working as a prison officer. The healthcare team had worked for a protracted period with no permanent Head of Service in post. Without a sufficient number of experienced staff, the prison had lost organisational memory, allowing poor custom and practice to become the norm amongst inexperienced and overwhelmed staff. Training All of the prison staff had completed the ITC programme, and yet there was widespread evidence of failures to do the basics. Staff failed to ensure the welfare of prisoners at roll count, failed to challenge flagrant breaches of prison rules such as passing items under cell doors, and did not know how to properly deal with obscured cell observation hatches. This calls into question the adequacy of their basic training, and the system for supervision and mentoring during the early years of practice. Healthcare staff were often not included in the same training as prison staff, and where agency staff were used to fill vacancies, they were not part of Trust training. Again, this led to poor custom and practice such as failing to read medical records before reviewing the mental health and wellbeing of the prisoners. Accepting there is a complex interplay between staffing numbers, experience and quality of training, I highlight to you my concern that continued understaffing of prison and healthcare teams will undoubtedly contribute to future deaths in custody. 2. A complete failure to identify and share risk pertinent information between prison and healthcare staff, and within those teams (response required from the Minister for Prisons, NHSE, Serco, Sodexo and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust) The staff remaining at the prison in March 2023 were, by their own admission, firefighting what was in front of them, rather than working in a collaborative and holistic way to better serve prisoner safety. There was a complete breakdown in the system of risk identification and information sharing. Prison and healthcare staff did not routinely consider information captured within the electronic systems, nor did they update the systems with risk pertinent information gathered during interactions with the prisoners. The prison records (the core file and P-NOMIS) and healthcare records (systemone) are a valuable source of risk pertinent information, that will enable prison and healthcare staff to comply with the mandatory requirement of PSI 64/2011 “All staff who have contact with prisoners must be aware of the triggers that may increase the risk of suicide, self-harm or violence, and take appropriate action.” Many prison and healthcare witnesses believed there was no working system in place at HMP Lowdham Grange to allow them to identify and share risk pertinent information. As a result, operational decisions were made in silo, and interactions with Anthony, David and Rolandas, were conducted without due consideration of their risk pertinent information. This causes concern from both a training and policy perspective. It would be impossible for prison and healthcare staff to remember the triggers for each and every prisoner in their care. Therefore, the system in place needs to make it as easy as possible for staff to quickly and readily understand the risk that exits for the prisoner and what might trigger that risk to materialise in any given circumstance. In this case, as in previous deaths, there was excessive focus on the prisoner's current presentation (i.e. the absence of saying they were going to harm themselves) without any understanding of their previous self-harm and suicidality. Specific missed opportunities included:  a failure by prison and healthcare staff to read the incoming prisoner's core file. This hard copy file contains valuable information such as previous ACCT documents and SASH warning forms, yet instead of reviewing this material and pulling out key triggers for past self-harm and suicidality and recording the same on P-NOMIS and/or systemone, the files were sent straight to storage. This is despite the fact that a background history of deliberate self-harm is an evidence- based risk factor for suicide as set out in PSI 64/2011  Healthcare staff concluding on Friday 3 March 2023 that Anthony's inability to attend a candle lighting service might be a trigger for self-harm, but such was not communicated to prison staff or safer custody or recorded on any prison systems  David's PNOMIS file clearly indicated his fear of joining the general prison population led to him requiring VP status in his previous establishment. However, the officers who sought to move him from the induction wing had not read his notes nor were they aware of the content of his previous ACCTs. HMPPS, prison and healthcare providers need to carefully scrutinise the system for identifying risk pertinent information to ensure that the staff on the ground know how and when to access that information to support timely risk assessment when engaging with prisoners. This is especially important in the early days in custody setting, but not exclusively so. I am also concerned by the use of email to convey risk pertinent information. In this case, prison staff communicated their concerns about Anthony's mental health to individual nursing Sodexo email inboxes, which the nurses were not expected to regularly access. The use of email means that such concerns are not accessible to other members of staff as they would be if they were recorded in PNOMIS or Systemone. Again, this needs to be addressed in policy and re-enforced in training. Staff told me that while the PSI mandates they should be aware of risks and triggers, there was no clearly documented system setting out how and when this should occur. 3. The system for transfer of prisoners between establishments is disorganised and unsafe (Minister for Prisons) I heard evidence in the course of exploring David's death, that he was transferred from the vulnerable prisoner unit ('VPU') at HMP Chelmsford to HMP Lowdham Grange, a prison which did not offer a VPU. David had been afforded VP status as a result of publicity about his business affairs and the nature of the offence that had resulted in his incarceration. He was scared that he might be targeted for violence and/or extorsion by fellow prisoners on account of this. David had been on 4 open ACCTs at HMP Chelmsford and had told his ACCT case co-ordinator that he was fearful of losing his VP status on transfer. While the Prison Director said he would have expected both HMP Chelmsford and HMP Lowdham Grange to have spoken about this risk in advance of the transfer, there is no evidence that any individual fully explored this potential trigger, and David was not informed that his VP status was being rescinded on leaving HMP Chelmsford. Between 20 October 2021 and 10 January 2022, Anthony made 17 applications to transfer to another prison because he did not feel safe at HMP Lowdham Grange. There were numerous intelligence reports to substantiate that Anthony was at risk of harm from others, and that, on occasion, he had been assaulted. Anthony's applications were dealt with in a haphazard manner. He did not receive a formal answer to his transfer request and had to chase many times for updates. This left Anthony feeling frustrated. I heard evidence that there is no formal policy framework or system for managing the progress of prison- to-prison transfers, including a lack of expected response times or formal escalation plan if a prison fails to provide any response. Notwithstanding the pressures on prison population management, it was agreed that the system for administering such applications should be co-ordinated and predictable, regardless of the success or otherwise of the application, rather than leading to prisoner frustration in waiting for answers that never come. 4. Failure to reduce isolation of Foreign National Prisoners (Minister for Prisons) Prison can be an isolating experience for any prisoner, but especially so for one who does not speak English. I heard evidence that the Big Word translation service did not work on multiple occasions across multiple sites within the prison. Staff gave evidence that even when the system did connect, they could be waiting in a queue for up to an hour to access an appropriate interpreter. There was no plan to seek to reduce Rolandas' obvious isolation, and seemingly no provision for expediting his induction so that he could be housed with fellow Lithuanian speakers. I have seen no evidence of a national or local plan to support Foreign National Prisoners. There is a clear risk of future self-inflicted deaths if language barriers and isolation are not adequately addressed. 5. Drugs (Minister for Prisons) HMP Lowdham Grange, like many establishments, continues to face challenges related to novel psychoactive substance misuse. There is no requirement for prisons to have an NPS specific drug policy and I am concerned that generic drug reduction strategies are ineffective against this particular threat. NPS is highly dangerous and carries a risk of death. I am concerned that more young men will die in custody as a result of NPS use. Matters relating to the transfer of the prison contract 6. The process of transferring the prison from one private provider to another, lacked sufficient scrutiny of the safety of the prison before, during and after the contract exit/transfer process (Minister for Prisons) Safety was not front and centre of the Mobilisation and Transfer project. I heard evidence from the HMPPS witnesses that there was a willingness to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. However, I invite a formal response detailing exactly what action has been taken or is proposed, as it is likely that further transfers shall occur across departments when PFIs expire, or contracts change provider. Matters relating to learning from deaths in custody 7. Persistent Failure to learn from deaths over many years (Serco Justice Director, Minister for Prisons) Embedding learning from deaths I heard evidence that many of the contributory factors leading to the deaths of Anthony, David and Rolandas, had been raised as issues in the investigations following previous deaths in custody at HMP Lowdham Grange. While Serco no longer manage HMP Lowdham Grange, they continue to manage prisons, and there is a risk of future deaths if the organisation is unable to create a robust culture of seeking to identify issues early, adopt learning, and continually monitor culture to ensure any action taken is embedded to reduce the risk of future deaths. From a HMPPS perspective, while private prison providers assume the operational risks of running the establishment, the HMPPS Controllers remain responsible for assuring a safe, decent and secure prison. I am concerned that the Controllers at HMP Lowdham Grange did not have a sufficient grasp of the longstanding cultural issues pertaining to safety. This raises the question of the efficacy of the Controller role and exactly how Controllers assure themselves that the provider is learning from deaths. 8. A failure to act with candour when engaging in post-death investigations (Minister for Prisons, Serco, Sodexo) Full, frank and timely disclosure of potentially relevant material to those investigating deaths The quality of any post-death investigation is predicated by the openness, honesty and transparency of the agencies involved. This inquest was beset with disclosure failures by HMPPS. A significant volume of disclosure, running to thousands of pages, was provided to the court towards the end of the hearing despite many months of active case management. HMPPS conduct their business primarily through emails, rather than any case management system, and it took a long time to review and supply this material to the court. HMPPS have no effective system for gathering, retaining, reviewing and disclosing potentially relevant material so that the issues relevant to death can be identified and learning put in place. If the process of learning from deaths is obfuscated by failures in the disclosure process, there is a risk that deaths will occur in the future from matters which could and should have been rectified. Candour The Healthcare Trust are subject to a statutory duty of candour. HMPPS, Serco and Sodexo failed to embrace the same ethos during these investigations. Consequently, there was minimal acceptance of the risk factors set out above, all of which may cause or contribute to deaths in the prison in the future. I have shared my concerns previously with those at HMP Lowdham Grange (PFD report relating to Christopher Howard Smith, dated 7 July 2023). I am troubled that unless there is a radical change in culture, and reflective learning from deaths is prioritised, prisoners will continue to die in custody. It is most concerning that there is a marked discrepancy between the failings that were admitted in oral evidence by the vast majority of witnesses when faced with irrefutable evidence, against the written statements submitted to the coronial investigations which contained very little, if any, reflection and candour. Even after the evidence had been called, the prison organisations did not respond to my request to advance admissions in order to relieve the jury of the burden of making findings on each and every issue. I would like to understand any action proposed by the Minister, Serco and Sodexo to address the issue of candour. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was suicide plus a narrative “Ella died as a consequence of hanging herself shortly after being seen by mental health care professionals. She intended to end her life and had told the mental health team she would do so or would harm others so that she would go to prison. There was a failure to undertake an adequate, or any, risk assessment and take any further steps to ensure Ella's safety on 14 November 2023.” 1a Asphyxia due to Hanging 1b 1c 1d II","Ella was 13 years old when she died at Kings College hospital on 15 November 2023 as a consequence of asphyxia due to hanging. Ella had a history of self-harm and had taken 2 overdoses, the first in December 2022 and the second in August 2023, with a self inflicted burn in February 2023 requiring treatment at a specialist burns unit. Ella's home life was complicated and she had been involved with social services in the form of Early Help intervention in the Autumn/Winter 2022/2023 although their involvement ended in February 2023. She had also been referred to school counselling services due to concerns about her mental health with low mood and suicidal ideation and was seen by a counsellor between April and July 2023. Her counsellor was able to provide some support but referrals made to the child and health adolescent mental health services were not progressed further. She was seen by the Crisis team from mental health services after her August overdose but declined further support from them and it was unclear if this was Ella or a combination of Ella and her parent's choice. A referral had been made by her school to social services in July 2023 when Ella disclosed a sexual assault to a member of staff at the school. Social services did not speak to Ella in July and having spoken to her mother considered that she did not reach their threshold for engagement and the school raised their concerns about this at the time. In the Autumn term there were clear signs that Ella was struggling at school and had said she wanted to move schools, a further referral was made to social services in September 2023 and Ella disclosed the name of the person who she said had assaulted her and the member of staff was duty bound to act on this disclosure and involved police. This led to some friction and there were discussions about how to support Ella but some conflict arose between school and home about the best way to deal with this and Ella's behaviour at school, including not attending lessons. Over the weekend of 10-12 November 2023 Ella had been out with friends and had a sleepover and came back tired and her parents found some messages on her phone which were deemed inappropriate by them. On 13 November 2023 Ella disclosed to a member of staff at school that she wanted to kill herself. The school completed a high risk mental health form for Ella to take with her to hospital and made arrangements for her to be picked up and taken by family to hospital. Ella was taken to Medway Maritime hospital by her stepfather and triaged and referred to the Crisis Team at a separate Mental Health Trust and a member of their team came to assess her in the emergency department. She was seen and reported her mood as low but denied intent to end her life but reported ongoing self-harm and suicidal ideation and requested an admission to hospital. She was assessed as being of medium risk of harm and a decision was made to see her at home by other members of the mental health team. That evening she argued with her parents and ran away from home barefoot and a stranger called the police on her behalf. She told police she was frightened of her stepfather and was worried about returning home. Whilst on the call to police her Mum arrived and took her home giving the call handler their address as she left. The police followed up the next morning. Ella was kept off school the next day and a member of the mental health home treatment team visited in the afternoon. Her documentation shows that she was aware that Ella had run away from home and that she said she would harm herself or others in order to go to prison and was documented as being suicidal and was hearing derogatory voices. The nurse contacted the safeguarding team at 16.02 after she had seen Ella and made a referral to social services. Ella's mother was on the telephone after the nurse had visited and went up to Ella's room where she found her hanging [REDACTED]. She called an ambulance and began cardiac massage on her daughter. The ambulance arrived and the crew continued with resuscitation attempts and a return of spontaneous circulation was obtained. Ella was taken by helicopter to Kings College hospital and was deeply unconscious on arrival and was admitted to critical care where she died shortly after 2pm on 15 December 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1)During the course of the inquest it became clear that Ella was a child in a complex family situation and showing signs of deterioration of her mental health. Her school had raised concerns about her with social services and taken steps to make sure she was seen by healthcare professionals when she indicated to staff at school she wanted to end her life on 13 November 2023. She was assessed by mental health nursing staff and accepted to the caseload of the Intensive Home Treatment Team. She was seen the following day and told the staff nurse who saw her that she was frightened of her stepfather and had run away from home barefoot and police called but she was brought back home by her mother who “grabbed her face” the morning she was seen. She told the nurse that she did not want to be in the family home and would rather go to prison and would harm herself or others is she had to stay at home. (2) This disclosure led to the nurse making a Safeguarding Referral but this was made after she left Ella's home and no urgent steps were taken to remove Ella either to a hospital bed or to ask social services to consider if she should be removed from the family home. Her school had raised concerns about her and she herself had indicated she wished to end her life. Evidence heard at the inquest was that this was the procedure in place and there is no shared access to records for all agencies and no way to convene an urgent multi-agency meeting to determine if Ella was safe to remain at home. Had steps been taken to share information between her school, social services and the mental health providers when she attend the emergency department on 13 November 2023 or early the following day rather than leave her at home she may have been removed from her home and may still be alive today. (3) Whilst there were concerns about the level of risk assessment undertaken on 14 November 2023 senior staff at the Trust gave evidence that she did not meet the criteria for admission to a hospital bed. This was difficult to reconcile with the documentary evidence as she was clearly crying out for help and her school had recognised this. No one agency involved had access to all the relevant information and concerns about Ella across the health, social care and education arenas. Evidence given suggested that shared records would assist but the ability to respond to urgent concerns would require a system change. (4)It was brought to the court's attention that the new Children's Wellbeing and Schools bill includes a duty to share information to promote safeguarding. In addition the local authority may convene a strategy meeting under s47 of the Children Act 1989 although the speed of convening a meeting would depend on availability and would obviously not be as swift as for example attending an accident and emergency department. If a multiagency meeting had been convened this may have prevented Ella's death and such action may reduce the risk of death for other children being in a similar position. 6."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: On 19th May 2024 Police were called to an address in Ashurst, Steyning by ambulance services where Kenton Beasley had sadly been found hanging. He was confirmed to be deceased at the scene and 3rd party involvement was ruled out. Notes indicating intent were found nearby; he had suffered with his mental and physical health for many years.","I concluded that Mr Beasley had sadly taken his own life, due to a severe deterioration in his mental health. A significant contributing factor to that had been his inability to secure long term employment in the transport sector (he had been an HGV driver and transport manager). As a result he had resorted to underpaid and exploitative work, and had been forced to borrow money from friends, leading to a sense of shame and remorse.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) There was a lengthy and unnecessarily protracted period (8 Sep 23 – 12 Mar 24) in which Mr Beasley was attempting to renew his licence, which meant he was unable to secure professional HGV driver employment. The following individual events and consequent frustrations exacerbated Mr Beasley's poor mental state: • DVLA wrote to his GP on 11 October 2023 and the GP surgery responded with the information they believed was required on 18 October 2023. • In a call from Mr Beasley to DVLA of 30 Nov 23 it was apparently confirmed that DVLA had all the necessary information and a 'DVLA Doctor' decision would be forthcoming soon. • It then transpired that was not the case and more or different information was required. There was then a further delay in securing another GP appointment. • Despite that second GP appointment being booked for 10 Jan 24, the DVLA questionnaire was never received by the GP. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Template Updated 15/10//2024 TG  Despite a GP letter sent after that appointment confirming no concerns at Mr Beasley's physical or mental health in terms of fitness to drive, this was rejected because it did not contain the information in questionnaire format.  It appears to have taken the intervention of his then MP, Greg Clarke, to unlock the impasse  There was a delay in booking a further GP appointment in Feb 24. The above was compounded by the fact that, even once his licence was renewed on 12 Mar 24, this was only for 12 months (to 11 Mar 25) - hence secure long-term employment was not offered.  Mr Beasley was further distressed at the prospect of having to repeat the renewal process. In the period Sep 23-Mar 24, whilst verbally informed that he was able to drive under s.88 RTA 1988, the online checker was showing his licence to have expired, hence over 20 potential employers refused to hire him, notwithstanding his attempts to explain s.88. Mr Beasley had been unable to find out the reason for the delay, nor was he informed until late in the process what the original reason for removal of his licence had been.  It eventually transpired that this arose due to a previous attempt at self-harm over twenty years earlier, since and despite which he had driven professionally for many years. It was never made clear why this was so. He was frequently unable to get through via the telephone advice service. Mr Beasley had attempted telephone contact on multiple occasions, but calls went unanswered and unattended.  Even though an individual medical caseworker was assigned, Mr Beasley's experience was that contact was still difficult and sporadic and he was constantly chasing rather than being kept informed.  On some occasions when he made telephone contact he was in tears of frustration but no vulnerable customer protocol appears to have been followed, nor was there any attempt to expedite his application or provide a fuller explanation as to the delay. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday. The jury made a narrative determination, which I attach.","On 5 November 2022, Mr Jones spent some 18 hours in the public waiting area of Stoke Newington Police Station, before climbing onto the flat hood of one of the phone booths, and jumping off onto the concrete floor. He suffered devastating injuries from which he died shortly thereafter.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. The jury noted that without the presence of a flat topped telephone hood, there would have been no means for Mr Jones to take his life in this manner. However, I heard at inquest that the telephone hoods in Stoke Newington Police Station have been replaced since Mr Jones's death, and the flat kind are nowhere else in the MPS estate. The jury also found that there was an MPS failure to have sufficient oversight of the public reception area from “the box”, the area that faces out to the public reception area. I heard that every police station has a different geographical layout, and that some of these are old buildings. However, a senior police officer giving evidence did accept that station officers could be positioned in the box facing out towards the public area, rather than further into the office facing each other. 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:- Suicide The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a [REDACTED] toxicity,"Kim Robinson's death was recognised at 05:16 on 12 th May 2024, at her home address in Suffolk. Kim had suffered for many years with chronic and debilitating leg and back pain, for which she took prescribed medication. Kim also suffered with her mental health and had previously taken overdoses of her prescribed medication. Toxicological analysis identified that Kim had the drug [REDACTED] in her system (an anxiety, heart and blood pressure medication) significantly above the toxic level. Kim was not prescribed [REDACTED] at the time of her death by her usual GP, but had obtained a supply from an on-line pharmacy. In order to obtain [REDACTED] on-line Kim ensured she supplied the required details, rather than her correct details. The process required to do this was described as a 'tick- box' exercise in court. When the online prescription was made (6 th May 2024), the prescribing clinician had no access to Kim's online GP records. Evidence was heard that had access to Kim's GP records been available to the prescribing clinician, the prescription of [REDACTED] would not have been made. Evidence heard in court identified that Kim's normal prescriptions were secured by a loved one, who controlled the amounts of prescription medication Kim could access at any one time. When delivered, the package containing the [REDACTED] was addressed to Kim, providing her direct access to a fatal quantity of prescription medication. Had the online prescription not be made, Kim's death would not have occurred.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you; the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows. – 1. Following Kim's tragic death the GP who had prescribed the prescription of to Kim, reviewed the current online system in place and identified five areas where in his evidence he identified changes could be made. The GP stated there was:- a) The need for online prescribers to be able to access a patient's records (at least the Summary Care Records). These records could be attached to the consultation for review by the prescriber. b) All patients could be asked for consent to share the details of their prescriptions with their current GP and/or regular practitioner. When consent is given, it was suggested a notice should be sent to these healthcare providers at the same time the medicine is delivered to the patient. Without such consent, the patient's order should not be accepted. c) Prescribers could have the ability to add comments when reviewing a consultation, whether it is approved or vetoed. d) All consultations could include the question: “Have you ever had suicidal behaviour or thoughts?” e) Prescriptions could be also for smaller quantities, taking into account the possible lethal dose of the medicine. If necessary, dispensing should be limited to weekly or reduced frequencies. Had these features been present on the on-line system, the GP stated he would not have issued a prescription of to Kim. In light of the evidence heard in this case I believe the current system of on-line prescription service needs to be reviewed. 2. It is of note, that the matter of concern regarding the ease in obtaining online prescriptions was previously raised by this court on 15th November 2019 in a Prevention of Future Death report following the tragic death of Deborah Headspeath on 3rd August 2017. 6"

The Vice Chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth 2. The Chief Executive of Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 3. The Chief Executive of Devon Partnership NHS Trust 1,"On the 1 st February 2022, an investigation was commenced into the death of Alexander Kieran Ari Channing (known as Alec), born on the 17 th July 2003. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 18 th December 2024. The Medical Cause of Death was: 1a Hanging The conclusion of the Inquest recorded that Alexander Channing died as a consequence of suicide in circumstances where decisions were made at the time of discharge from hospital on 19/1/22 not to involve the Home Treatment Team and to postpone a Community Mental Health Team meeting on 25/1/22 which has led to missed opportunities to reassess his risk of suicide, the last missed opportunity being two days before his death.",In 2021 Alec had been diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. He had been detained in hospital under s.2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 between 29/7/21 and 11/8/21. Following discharge he was seen by the Home Treatment Team and then the Community Mental Health Team. There was a delay in the transfer of care from the Community Mental Health Team based where his family lived to the Community Mental Heath Team in his university town. It was believed that the transfer could not take place until he had registered with a GP surgery in his university town. The referral was opened by the new Community Mental Health Team on 24/11/21. Alec was detained in hospital under s.2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 between 7/1/22 and 19/1/22. On discharge a decision was made not to involve the Home Treatment Team. An appointment was fixed for Alec to meet with the Community Mental Health Team on 25/1/22 for an assessment. Alec contracted Covid on or around 25/1/22 and the assessment meeting was postponed as it was deemed necessary for there to be a face to face assessment. On 27/1/22 Alec was found suspended by a ligature in his room at his university halls of residence. Paramedics attended and pronounced him dead at the scene. Dorset Police investigated and found no suspicious circumstances.,The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. The number of students commencing or resuming studies following the Covid 19 pandemic with mental health issues and requiring support from the wellbeing services at Arts University Bournemouth has significantly increased. ii. Alec was to be transferred from the Community Mental Health Team in his home town to the Community Mental Health Team in his university town. The transferring CMHT were unaware that it was possible to arrange a direct transfer to the receiving CMHT without the need for Alec to be first registered with a GP surgery in his university town. iii. Alec was admitted to a district hospital on 7/1/22 and seen by the Liaison Psychiatry Team. Following a decision to discharge Alec from hospital it was decided that a referral to the Home Treatment Team was unnecessary. Alec was discharged to a date provided by the CMHT in his university town. There was no involvement of that CMHT in his discharge planning. iv. Alec had initially indicated that he would consent for information to be shared with others but that consent was withdrawn. There was no pro active approach taken by the CMHT in his home town to seek his consent to share information. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. There is no training provided to the wellbeing services at the Arts University Bournemouth in relation to students diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. 3 ii. There appears to be a failure amongst staff at the Exter CMHT to appreciate that there can be a direct transfer of a patient's care to another CMHT Trust without the need for a patient to have to first register with a GP surgery iii. There was a lack of involvement of a responsible clinician in the process of discharge planning from the district hospital in Exeter to the care of Bournemouth CMHT at Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. iv. There is no policy in place at Devon Partnership NHS Trust which encourages a repeated proactive approach in seeking consent from a patient to share information at relevant times. 6

The conclusion of the inquest was: 1a Suicide,"Shaun Hall suffered with mixed anxiety, depressive disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder. He regularly consulted his GP for these problems. On 2 November 2023 he attended A&E at Northampton General Hospital having taken an intentional overdose of olanzapine, tramadol and paracetamol. On the advice of his GP he self- referred to NHS Northamptonshire Talking Therapies on 13 November 2023. A telephone assessment took place on 20 th November 2023. The Mental Health Support Practitioner was so concerned at Shaun's presentation that she made a referral to the Urgent Care and Assessment Team the following day. The referral was declined. Mr Hall was subsequently found deceased in the grounds of Whittlebury Hall on 14 th December 2023 having hung himself. My conclusion was suicide.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 nd January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that on 13 th October 2023 at some time between midnight and 5.10 am William Campbell Bissett died by hanging. He died by suicide in cell 2/12 on the Haven Unit at HMP Wymott. A failure of advance planning prior to 5 th October 2023 for accommodation for Mr Bissett on release and insufficient engagement with him by prison offender management and the probation service may have contributed to his death.,Mr Bissett was serving a long sentence at HMP Wymott in respect of historic sex crimes. On 13 th October 2023 at the age of 88 he was due to be released on licence. The terms of his licence included an exclusion zone the effect of which meant that he was not allowed to return to his home and as a result upon release would be living separate from his wife of 56 years. On 6 th March 2023 his Prison Offender Manager met with his Community Offender Manager in order to hand over responsibility for release arrangements. Mr Bissett was not present at the handover meeting and was only seen by his Community Offender Manager for the first time on 5 th October 2025. An application for emergency accommodation was lodged on 6 th October and on 11 th October 2023 Mr Bissett was interviewed by housing officers from Fylde Borough Council.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 2 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (1) Evidence was heard to the effect that in the 8-month period before a prisoner is released arrangements for release are the responsibility of the Community Offender Manager with the Prison Offender Manager acting as a conduit of information. Further it was said that the Community Offender Manager should arrange an early meeting with the prisoner. Mr Bissett a man aged 88 in failing health only saw his Community Offender Manager on 5th October 2023, 8 days before his release. (2) On 23rd June 2023 Mr Bissett was informed of the terms of his licence upon release. He was informed that he would not be allowed to return home. No sufficient attempt was made to engage with Mr Bissett to discuss accommodation in the event that he was unable to find a place to live himself. (3) 56 days before release, it being clear that Mr Bissett had nowhere to go, planning for accommodation should have been commenced with Fylde Borough Council who would have the duty to provide temporary housing and who would have engaged with Mr Bissett to discuss his requirements. (4) 56 days before release HMP Wymott should have informed the Fylde Coast Local Authorities that Mr Bissett would be homeless upon release so that his name appeared on the agenda for the monthly Prison Release Meeting. This was not done. (5) Lack of planning for release and lack of engagement left Mr Bissett only with the knowledge that he would probably have to live the rest of his life separated from his wife. No attempt was made to help him come to terms with this reality. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was 'Open' and the medical cause of death was established as la) Drowning II) Post-Vaccination Auto-Immune Encephalopathy. 4,"In December 2021 the deceased received the vaccination against Covid 19. This was his booster. He reacted very badly to the vaccination and thereafter suffered from Auto- Immune Encephalopathy, the effects of which were devastating both physically and mentally. On the 12th March 2024 the deceased went to a bridge over the Manchester Ship Canal, climbed over the parapet and fell into the water. His body was discovered four days later.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: During the course of the evidence, the GP, who was acting on behalf of BARDOC, the out of hours provider, indicated to me that she had never been trained by BARDOC, in how to follow their 'pathways'; this meant that she 'closed' the call alter speaking to the patient, rather than returning it to the Ambulance Service as should have happened. She was also confused about how she could access the patient's own GP records; again, she said she had not had any training in this regard. During the course of the evidence, I heard, yet again, the common complaint that one health professional is unable to access the health records of the patient held by another health professional. In this case, the manager of the 111 Helpline agreed that the various IT systems do not ""talk to each other"". It is of concern to me as to why all bona fide health professionals cannot have access to all health data held anywhere within the NHS.

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide and the medical cause of death was 1a) Hypoxic brain injury 1b) Hanging. 4,"Nathan Harry Shepherd had a history of mental health issues and drug use. Whilst in custody in 2023 he was subject to an ACCT following him taking an excess amount of medication in his cell. His calls were recorded from June 2023 and indicated he was using drugs and that his mental health fluctuated. On 8th January 2024 he was released from custody to approved premises at Ascot House. He was allocated a single room at Ascot House, he did not indicate any immediate thoughts of suicide or self-harm to staff. The full extent of his mental health history and ACCT history was not known to the staff at Ascot House. This was due to poor information sharing by probation service staff, this probably did not contribute to his death. On 11th January 2024 he sent a series of messages to other residents which demonstrated he was deteriorating. Staff were unaware of those messages. Ascot House overnight was staffed by one member of probation and an agency worker. Both were required to be first aid trained. On 11th January a text message was sent by Nathan Shepherd to the landline in the office at Ascot House. It caused the phone to ring and the message said the door was blocked and he was hanging. It was acted on by the member of staff going straight to Nathan Shepherd's room. An attempt to gain entry was unsuccessful because he had barricaded himself into the room. The barricading of entry to the room was made possible because the furniture was moveable. Attempts were made to force entry. After approximately 12 and a half minutes, entry was gained, and Nathan Shepherd was found suspended from a ligature. Entry would have been gained immediately had he not been able to barricade himself into his room. The staff cut the ligature on entry releasing the compression and began CPR. Paramedic assistance arrived approximately within 10 minutes after the staff gained entry. CPR continued along with attempts to intubate him. Intubation was unsuccessful until the arrival of a critical care paramedic. Successful intubation was followed by a return of spontaneous circulation at 06:38. He was transported to Stepping Hill Hospital where a CT scan 08:35 showed extensive loss of grey-white matter differentiation indicating an anoxic brain injury. He was moved to the critical care unit. On 15th January a further scan showed that the position had deteriorated further and he had a hypoxic brain injury that was not compatible with life. He died at Stepping Hill Hospital on 16th January 2024. 5",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest heard evidence that the Probation Service had no policy to cover incidents of residents barricading themselves into rooms at Approved Premises. This meant that staff did not have training on how to deal with a situation. The inquest was told that the Probation Service were now developing such a policy but it had not been signed off or rolled out to staff. 2. A copy of the draft policy was available to the inquest but it was unclear what if any discussion there had been with Police Forces and how it would link in with Police policies such as the GMP Right Care Policy. 3. The evidence before the inquest was that Mr Shepherd was able to barricade himself with relative ease due to the mobility of the furniture in his room. The Approved Premises had no clear policy regarding furniture which meant that furniture could be used to create a barricade with relative ease. 4. The was a ligature point. Such ligature points remained in the Approved premises. It was unclear if changes could be made to reduce the risk they presented. 5. Agency staff were used under a national contract. The evidence before the inquest was that at the time of Mr Shepherd's death there was no policy for ensuring they could deliver CPR / First Aid. It was part of the national contract that they should be so trained but there were no checks to ensure that this part of the contract was being followed. The evidence at the inquest was that the agency worker in place on the night did not appear able to deliver CPR. 6. Evidence from Probation and Prison staff showed a lack of understanding of how the prison system could update the probation system and where that information could be found. This meant that key information was not shared effectively creating a risk that probation staff in the community would not have a full picture of risk. 7. The inquest heard evidence that the information shared with the Approved Premises staff by other probation staff was not accurate and did not give a full picture of risk. This was in part due to the fact that it appeared key documents were being regularly completed by probation staff who were not the allocated probation officer and so were unfamiliar with the history. 6

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 th December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) hanging.,"On 9th July 2024, Paul Williams was found suspended from a ligature outside Screwfix at Unit 5 Haigh Park. Police found no suspicious circumstances.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The inquest heard that Paul Williams was a hard working family man in employment. He and his family had been evicted from their privately rented accommodation and became homeless. They were given a period of 2 weeks to leave the property and find alternative accommodation. Whilst looking for accommodation the family was forced to live in separate locations. In his case that included living in a vehicle in the week. The inquest was told that the family was a priority case but a shortage of public housing meant that in total they had to wait almost 3 months before suitable accommodation became available. The evidence before the inquest was that the housing situation including the eviction, the homelessness and need to live separately whilst waiting for suitable accommodation to become available had a significant impact on his mental health and contributed to his deteriorating condition. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 01 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Harry Southern died on the 12th of October 2023 at Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. He tied a ligature around his neck the day before which led to hypoxic brain injury. He did so with the intention of ending his life.,"Harry Southern had a history of mental illness and involvement from his GP, the Trust's mental health services and sessions with a private therapist. He had had a traumatic last year of his life which involved the death of relatives, the breakdown of a relationship and the suicide of someone he knew. He had had a previous suicide attempt in June 2023 and in October he left a final note and sadly took his life.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the course of the Inquest, evidence was provided of the many services available to young men such as Harry who have attempted suicide including services such as the Haven and numbers they can contact if they are suicidal. However, I am concerned that this information is not in fact provided to people in Harry's circumstances. Evidence was heard from Harry's father that indicated that in fact the contact numbers are not answered and do not cater for those with hearing difficulties or other disabilities. Young people in particular are not aware of other services such as Papyrus, a charity that has a round the clock suicide prevention helpline aimed at young people who are suicidal. Younger people with mental health difficulties of course will tend to be more familiar with social media and apps to discuss their problems in addition to just conventional phone numbers. I am also alarmed at the evidence given at the Inquest that cutbacks and funding issues may result in services to those with mental health difficulties being reduced even further. The Health Secretary will be copied into this Report because I am concerned this may well be a national problem. The inability of young people in particular with mental health difficulties (and their families) Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 to contact someone at all times who will be able to speak with them (or being made aware that there are agencies who can speak with them) does give rise to a risk of future deaths and"

An inquest was opened on 7 August 2024. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard by me on 14 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was 'suicide'. The medical cause of death was: 1a asphyxiation [REDACTED]","Student A lived in student accommodation at Somerset Court, Aldenham Street, London. He was last known to be alive on 27 July 2024, having spoken to his mother on the telephone and being seen returning to his address by staff at Somerset Court. The following morning, staff at the accommodation were requested to conduct a welfare check on Student A. At about 10:50 on 28 July 2024, staff noted Student A to be unresponsive (not responding to his name being shouted) in his room, but only saw his legs on the bed from the doorway to the room. Emergency services were called following a subsequent welfare check, at approximately 12:00, in which staff found Student A on his bed with [REDACTED]. Paramedics verified the fact of Student A's death shortly thereafter. He died of asphyxiation having intended to end his own life.","During the course of my investigation and the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: I received statements (taken by police officers) from three members of staff at Somerset Court, which is operated by Unite Students. 1. On 28 July 2024, the request for a welfare check was received by staff at Somerset Court, from the Emergency Control Centre (the ECC) for Unite Students, at approximately 07:00. The basis of the request was that Student A's mother had been unable to contact her son. The member of staff advised the ECC that they would try to 'call the student and if he did not answer I would then go to his room.' At approximately 10:15, the staff member called Student A's mobile telephone three times, 'but it did not ring it only beeped.' At approximately 10:50, the staff member went upstairs to Student A's room and received a call from the ECC but 'ignored the call' to go to Student A's room. While at the material time there was no way of knowing whether this was an emergency or not, the concern here is that it nevertheless took hours for the request for a welfare check to be actioned in any way. Further, on getting no response from attempts at contact by telephone, there was further delay in physically attending Student A's room. 2. When attending Student A's room at about 10:50 on 28 July 2024, the member of staff knocked repeatedly on the door and asked for Student A to come to the door. The staff member then used their staff pass to open the door, on account of getting no response. In their statement, the staff member sets out that they remained in the doorway and could see Student A's legs (from the knees down) on the bed within the room. The statement continues, 'I called out to the student and stated that it was reception and asked if they were okay. At this time I was scared so I closed the door and went to the stairwell.' The staff member spoke to the ECC and explained the circumstances to them and the ECC advised the staff member to call an ambulance 'and to also get someone from one of the other buildings that is run by the university.' Following the call with the ECC, the staff member sent a text message to their 'general manager' explaining the situation and requesting that a receptionist from another building be sent to assist. The staff member's statement then says, 'At approximately 1134 I called my manager and whilst on the phone returned to the room and knocked on the door repeatedly. I shouted out and knocked loudly. The student did not answer the door.' The staff member then returned to reception and telephoned for a colleague in another building to come and assist. Assistance from a colleague arrived at approximately 12 noon. Both members of staff then made their way to Student A's room where, upon entering they found Student A unresponsive on his bed in the manner already described at section 4 of this report. As a result, the staff left the room, returned to reception and 'called our managers and emergency services and we waited for their arrival.' The concerns here are numerous:  It was obvious to staff that Student A was, at the very least, unresponsive / difficult to rouse at about 10:50, which on any view would be regarded as a serious / emergency situation. However, it appears that no positive or definitive action was taken to assist for over an hour.  The ECC advised the staff member to call an ambulance at about 10:50, yet this was not done until approximately 12 noon.  The staff member who first checked on Student A at 10:50, went no further than threshold (seeing no more than his legs) and therefore did little, if anything, to satisfy themselves about the true welfare status of Student A.  The staff members who attended Student A's room at approximately 12 noon, did not attempt to render basic assistance or first aid to Student A.  In the particular circumstances of Student A's case, he was highly likely to have been deceased for hours prior to his death being verified by paramedics at 12:27. However, that fact was not known to staff at the material time and, therefore, they would have been expected to act in accordance with any protocols or policy in place at that time. Given these matters, I am concerned that there may be a lack of appropriate training in place for staff or, if there is such training in place, that it may not be effective. Nothing in the evidence available to me has suggested that the future risks posed by my concerns have been addressed. 6"

During the inquest, I heard that is a pedestrian walkway running underneath the M56 motorway. On the northern side of the motorway (eastbound carriageway side) the entrance to the walkway tunnel is constructed so that the buttress walls form a ramp-like structure which has a shallow gradient topped with a waist-high railing which provides an easily accessible and walkable route from the footpath to the Armco crash barrier bordering the hard shoulder of the eastbound motorway carriageway. 2. Also leading from is an established track through undergrowth running west parallel to the motorway. That path leads directly to a fixed bespoke metal ladder which appears to be specifically positioned so as to enable a person to climb up to the Armco crash barrier bordering the hard shoulder of the eastbound carriageway. 3. There is no fencing to prevent access over the Armco crash barrier onto the motorway itself along this stretch of the eastbound carriageway, in contrast to the substantial fencing positioned behind the Armco crash barrier along the opposite stretch of the westbound carriageway. 2"

An inquest into Ms Milward's death was opened on 14 March 2024. The inquest was resumed on 13 December 2024 and concluded on 20 December 2024.

The medical cause of Ms Milward's death was:

1a. Mixed Drug Toxicity

With respect to where, when and how Ms Milward came by her death it was recorded at Box 3 of the Record of Inquest as follows:

Tammy Denise MILWARD was found unresponsive by police following concerns for her welfare at her home in Esher Surrey on 1 January 2024. Her death was formally recorded by paramedics at 21:34 hours the same day. She had been prescribed [REDACTED] and toxicology revealed a potentially fatal concentration of [REDACTED], in excess of prescribed levels, in her blood sample and that she had also used cocaine shortly before her death. As a result, Ms Milward died of the effects of mixed drug toxicity.

The inquest concluded with a short form conclusion of 'Drug Related':","Ms Milward had a history of mental health problems including severe obsessive compulsive disorder. She was prescribed [REDACTED] and diazepam by her GP to help her deal with pain following a road traffic collision in approximately 2012. She had become dependent on her medication. On the advice of her GP, she wanted to reduce prescription levels, but she found this difficult to achieve and on occasions Ms Milward used her prescribed medication too quickly and had to request more through her GP. This caused her distress, and she would self-harm, or threaten self-harm. Towards the latter part of 2023, the GP practice referred Ms Milward to Surrey and Borders NHS Foundation Trust on several occasions for mental health support. As a result advice was provided by I-Access and she was referred to GP Integrated Mental Health Service (GPimhs). On 28 December 2023, Ms Milward sent an email message asking to be discharged from the GPimhs. In that email she accused her GPs of leaving her without medication and that “they are the reason for everything that happens next”. GPimhs did not contact Ms Milward about her message and she was discharged from their service the next day. Separately on the 28 December 2023 Ms Milward's pharmacy contacted her GP practice and told them she wanted her prescription and had threatened self-harm. The practice spoke to Ms Milward and then the GP left a message for Ms Milward confirming the prescription had been authorised and providing her with crisis numbers. The GP was unaware that GPimhs had received a message from Ms Milward and GPimhs was not aware of the welfare concern raised by the pharmacy. Ms Milward phoned her mother in the early morning of 1 January 2024 and talked about going shopping. But later that day concerns were raised about her wellbeing and police conducted a welfare check and found her unresponsive. Toxicology revealed that she had used a significant amount of [REDACTED] as well as cocaine shortly before her death.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: The Inquest heard evidence that Ms Milward's case presented treatment challenges which several agencies sought to address but there was limited coordination, in particular that: a. The Coroner heard that the GP could not see GPimhs medical records (or any SABP notes) which are recorded on SystmOne and that GPimhs could not easily access the GP medical records held on EMIS. As a result, neither the GP practice, nor GPimhs was aware that the other had received messages from or about Ms Milward on 28 December 2023. The coroner heard from SABP that there is ongoing work ongoing to create greater connectivity between the various electronic record systems, but this work is not yet complete. b. The evidence heard suggests that there was little personal or practical interaction between the GP practice and GPimhs. The coroner was told that GPimhs had been recently introduced by SABP to work alongside GPs (addressing a need in primary care to provide mental health support) but that levels of interaction varied and was sometimes also undermined by a lack of suitable estate for co-location of GPimhs staff in GP practices. The coroner is concerned that the lack of coordination and communication between primary and secondary care providers may place patients at risk of early death. 7"

[REDACTED] - West Yorkshire Police","On the 15 th March 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Anugrah Abraham (“Anu”). Anu died on the 4 th March 2023 in Woodland near Red Rock Lane in Bury. He was 21 years old. The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a) Hanging. I recorded a conclusion of Suicide recording the circumstances as follows: “The deceased was a serving West Yorkshire police officer. He had been on annual leave since the 16 th February 2023. He was due to return to work on the 4 th March 2023. The prospect of returning to work is likely to have been a source of distress to the deceased. On the 3 rd March 2023 in the early afternoon he left his home address. There was nothing in his behaviour which gave rise to concerns from his family. At 22:50 hours when he had not returned home, Greater Manchester Police were contacted and he was reported missing. In the early morning of the 4 th March 2023 the deceased was located in a wooded area near Red Rock Lane, Radcliffe. He had died as a result of hanging with the intention of ending his life.”","In 2021 Anu had joined West Yorkshire Police (“WYP”) under the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship programme (“PCDA”). This was in conjunction with Leeds Trinity University (“LTU”). At the time it was only possible to join the police if you already had a degree or undertook at degree alongside training to be a police officer. In 2021 the application programme was online and there was no face to face assessment. In addition, a decision had been taken by WYP Chief Officers to remove the in-force interviews. Of note, Anu had not achieved the grades required at A level to undertake a stand alone policing degree. Prior to commencing the PCDA there is no evidence of Anu having any issues with his mental health. The court heard from a large number of witnesses in respect of various aspects of the PCDA and how it operated in practice. I found as a matter of fact that : – there should have been closer working between the Central Assessment Unit in WYP, in particular the student officer's assessor and the District Sgts who had day to day line management responsibilities for the officer. – Anu had emerged from his 12 week training at Carr Gate on a development plan. This was not immediately known to his District Sgts and also raised concerns as to the decision to place officers onto patrol when they had failed to demonstrate the skills required of them. – Anu was subject to what were described as “Stage 1 meetings in accordance with Regulation 13 of the Police Regulations 2003”. Within WYP, use of regulation 13 had developed into a series of staged meetings. Anu was subject to a “stage1” meeting. It was not immediately clear where the process for implementing various stages of Regulation 13 emanated from. In Anu's case his District Sgts were not aware Anu was subject to such a review as this information was not shared with them. – The lack of shared information between those taksed with the various aspects of Anu's management led to mixed, inconsistent messages to Anu as to how he was developing and performing. – On the 24 th September 2022 Anu was referred to Occupational Health (“ODU”) the waiting time to be seen was three months. He was not seen until the 15 th December 2022. The referral had been for a back injury but also his mental health. There was an inadequate assessment of his mental health and a lack of consideration of any adjustments required given his mental health issues were linked to his work and the PCDA. – During this time he also accessed the Employee Assistance Programme and was referred to a counsellor. In October 2022 it was recorded that he was suffering from severe anxiety and severe depression. This was linked to the PCDA programme and his work. He reported having suicidal thoughts. This information provided to the counsellor was not shared with WYP. – On the 4 th January 2023 Anu had a lengthy meeting with one of his Sgts following which he attended a quarterly review. The serious concerns WYP had as to Anu's ability were not shared or reflected in the quarterly review. – There was a lack of clarity and understanding as to what options were available to students if they wanted to leave the PCDA programme after 2 years but continue with the degree element. Evidence was contradictory as to whether there academic credits could be used to continue on a degree albeit they may have to fund any remaining years. – On the 13 th January 2023 Anu made direct contact with the OHU where it was acknowledged he appeared to be in “intense mental distress.” Whilst he was spoken to again later that day, there was no plan documented that he would be seen or re-contacted by OHU, this appeared to be because Anu had made direct contact and it had not been a referral from a senior manager. Anu should have been offered a face to face appointment. – On the 23 rd January following further concerns about Anu's work he had a meeting with a District Sgt and was advised he was being placed on a further development plan. A subsequent email was sent to Anu by his Sgt setting out his development. During the course of this meeting Anu indicated he felt suicidal. An urgent referral was made to OHU. The subsequent email to Anu in no way was reflective of a caring approach to an individual who was expressing suicidal thoughts. – Following this urgent referral to OHU an appointment was offered for April 2023. Anu should have been offered an urgent face to face appointment.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
National Police Chiefs Council and West Yorkshire Police

1. The court heard that most OHU referrals within police forces now relate to mental health issues as opposed to physical health issues. Despite this, there are no specialist Registered Mental Health nurses recruited into WYP OHU. Indeed the court heard the situation within WYP may be indicative of the national picture.

2. Following Anu's death there was no investigation into the quality of care afforded to him by the OHU within WYP. Hence at the time of the Inquest, there had been no reflection by practitioners as to the quality of care provided and no learning in respect of processes and procedures. It was accepted that following the Inquest there were matters which would be considered. The lack of investigation meant learning from deaths in order to prevent future deaths was not addressed.

National Police Chiefs Council National Wellbeing service

3. The court heard as to the increase in mental health issues amongst Police Officers nationally. Despite this, the question of what imminent adjustments should be made or considered once an officer discloses suicidal thoughts, was unclear. This is before an OHU appointment. In this case Anu's mental deterioration was reportedly directly linked to his role as a police officer. It is acknowledged that this is a difficult issue and there will be issues such as confidentiality to consider.

College of Policing

4. Whilst the court heard there are now different routes into policing and there is no longer a requirement to undertaken a degree. The court heard from a significant number of officers who had undertaken the PCDA. Many of the witnesses told the court of the impact this route into policing had on them at the time, including the levels of stress they incurred. The PCDA does continue to operate.

College of Policing and National Police Chiefs Council

5. Ensuring there is a full understanding across Police forces as to the PCDA and the sharing of accurate information with all those involved in the management of student officers so there is clear documented records and understanding as to how a student officer is progressing and whether they are likely to become an efficient constable.

6. Consideration of the Regulation 13 process for PCDA students and how this works in practice across forces."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 th December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: SUICIDE.","Eden Anna Street displayed traits from a very early age which would be consistent with Autism. Several of her family members were also affected with neurodiversity issues. Her Mother was concerned about her behaviour and communication issues and referrals to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services took place, although the first referral was rejected. She was also diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome and when the diagnosis was made, her tics and involuntary movements improved. She was on the waiting list for both creative therapy as well as the East Yorkshire Autistic Service. She received good pastoral support from her school. Despite concern about suicidal thoughts that she had written on the school lavatory wall which resulted in her mother contacting CAMHS, which occasioned an immediate risk assessment to take place, nothing immediate was identified. A decision was made to expedite the start of creative therapy but due to the practitioner's care load being full of cases of equal, if not greater acuity, this did not prove possible. Eden was found suspended by her sister in the bedroom [REDACTED]. The emergency services attended and continued resuscitation that had been started by her parents, but despite this, she could not be revived and was declared deceased on the night of 27th June 2021. It is not possible to determine on the evidence available whether earlier diagnosis of Autism or the institution of creative therapy would have avoided her death on the day it occurred.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Whereas the Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust has implemented a number of measures following the publication of a Serious Incident Investigation Report in light of admitted failings, evidence was heard that information provided by parents of autistic children via a telephone helpline operated by the Trust, is not fed back to the weekly audit meeting convened by the Trust. As a result, information about children with neurodiversity issues that might have altered for the worse, may not be available to those who can alter their clinical priorities. 6"

He stated that he felt he should be punished and everyone would be better off if he was dead. He said a decline in his mental health had led to him self-harming a number of times, but he didn't think he could actually end his life and had thrown away a razor blade just before coming to the police. Officers took him to Worthing General Hospital Emergency Department to receive help. They helped him sign in at 1840 and he told reception that he was experiencing suicidal thoughts. Officers left him in the care of hospital staff. He was seen around an hour later appearing calm. He was not called for triage until 1946 but did not respond. ED staff notified the MHLT who confirmed he was known to their service. They were only told he was experiencing suicidal thoughts and made internal notification to his lead practitioner. Both teams attempted contact by telephone to Mr Summersett's mobile, to no avail. MHLT were unaware that he had been brought to hospital by Police, who were not informed he had left the ED. Nor were his former partner or GP informed. Neither Police nor his partner therefore attempted contact. On 7th February Police and SECAMB were called at 1415 to report that a male had been found deceased in his car in Arundel, subsequently identified as Mr Summersett.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Regulation 28 – After Inquest Template Updated 15/10//2024 TG Whilst I heard evidence that the UHS Foundation Trust has a Missing Person policy – Walkouts/absconding patients (approved 23 May 2024), in Mr Summersett's case there was a lack of recorded and/or shared information across all the agencies and teams with whom he had had contact, or to whom he was known, such that an accurate and fully reflective risk assessment was not achieved, exacerbated by delays in the triage process in the ED. Mr Summersett was not notified to Police as a missing person and nor were Police informed he had left the ED, despite them simultaneously raising a safeguarding risk via a Vulnerable Adult Single Combined Assessment of Risk Form. In sum, there was therefore a lack of information sufficiency, flow and sharing across the agencies whilst he was present in, and at and after the point he left, the ED, which might have enabled greater efforts to locate, contact and more urgently treat him. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: On the 5th February 2024 Jan Michael Raciborski died at his home address in Caversham after he hung himself. He had suffered with mental health issues for the majority of his life which, along with the impact of a brain injury resulting from an historic attempt to end his life, significantly affected his mood and decision making processes.","Mr Raciborski suffered from depression and a brain injury for many years. This led to a complex presentation and he was under the care and treatment of the South Oxon Adult Mental Health Team (AMHT) from 2022. He had previously been sectioned, spent time as a voluntary patient and the mental health services had had involvement on and off over the past 40 years. The AMHT worked closely with Mr Raciborski and he had both a care co-ordinator and support worker, as well as involvement with further staff members. He had many contacts with them during his final period of care. He had a history of impulsive actions and intermittent suicidal thoughts. In August 2023 his condition deteriorated before then improving. In November 2023 this happened again and this presentation was in keeping with a pattern over the years. In January 2024 he had a fleeting thought of suicide and was assessed by a mental health team in London. He subsequently had contact with his local AMHT. He remained distressed over the following days until he was found deceased on the 5 th February 2024.",During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 None of the records of contact with Mr Raciborski completed by the AMHT in the period from August 2023 to the date of Mr Raciborski's death contained any written record of a risk assesment. I found that in Mr Raciborski's case this absence did not impact his treatment and was not a causative factor. However my concern is that the failure to properly record the details of a risk assesment can lead to inadequate information sharing and the possiblity of someone who relies upon the records gaining the wrong impression. In addition it does not allow the adequacy of the risk assesments to be properly investigated and could hinder investigations into deaths; which mean that a matter giving rise to a risk to life may not be identified in future investigations. 6

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16th December 2024 . The short form conclusion of the inquest was one of Suicide Medical cause of death was 1a Asphyxia","The record of inquest was as follows: “Matthew Brierley died in the carpark of Buttermere Court Hotel, Buttermere, Cumbria on 24th April 2024. He was under great personal stress due to a police investigation and bail conditions imposed. It is most likely that this stress caused him to take his own life by [REDACTED] asphyxiation”. Matthew had been arrested at his home in Fareham on 16th March, Hampshire police having received information that he was linked to a Paypal account used to purchase indecent images of children in 2023. Matthew denied the allegation in a “no comment” interview and was bailed pending enquiries and examination of his computer and mobile devices. Bail conditions precluded him from living or sleeping at home or having any unsupervised contact with his biological children or stepdaughter. His employers the Border Force were also informed and Matthew was suspended from work. On 23rd April Matthew left Hampshire driving north to Buttermere, a place that had special meaning for him. The following morning he was found deceased in his car [REDACTED]. He left several final messages in his car.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) It is recognized that men in Matthew's circumstances are at a markedly elevated risk of suicide. Several papers refer to this - I found Kothari et al (Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine, July 2021) particularly informative. They quote 3.2% of those arrested in operation Notarise committing suicide and explore reasons why this group is particularly vulnerable. (2) I was told that when released on bail Matthew was informed that examination of devices and a decision in his case might take up to 18 months. Being suspended from work and unable to live at home removed normality and stability from Matthew and likely impaired his ability to cope with his situation. The length of time taken to reach a decision seems excessive, prolonging the time Matthew would be at risk. I was told devices can be ""triaged"" within a matter of days or more quickly, surely cases such as this should be dealt with more expeditiously? It seems that ""standard"" bail conditions are applied but I am not aware of any suggestion of a specific risk to Matthew's stepdaughter, might a more detailed individual assessment of risk be helpful? I should record that Matthew's phone was examined after his death and that images found were not of a grade that would have led to a prosecution. (3) Police acknowledged the increased risk and completed a standard assessment form when Matthew was released - he denied any risk and also declined referral to Liaison and Diversion service. A Family Contact Officer was also appointed but the onus remained on Matthew to seek help and there was no proactive contact which might have been helpful as men in Matthew's situation are less likely to seek help due to feelings of shame and embarrassment. 6"

Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Arundel Road, Worthing, West Sussex, BN13 3EP via email 2. Chief Executive, NHS England, Quarry House, Quarry Hill, Leeds, LS2 7UE via email 1","On 21 March 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Morgan Rose Betchley, formerly Sladovic, aged 19 years. The investigation was concluded at the end of the Inquest on 22 nd November 2024. The conclusion given by the jury was a narrative conclusion namely: Morgan died as a result of her own actions. Historical evidence suggests that in all probability Morgan's intent had been to self-harm as a cry for help and that it was not her intention to end her life. Morgan was a young vulnerable adult who had suffered with her mental health for many years, including a history of self-harm and suicidal ideations. Following a significant decline in her mental health she was admitted and Sectioned (under Section 2 and Section 136) on multiple occasions to several medical facilities for her safety and to receive an enhanced level of care. The evidence shows repeated failures to follow policies and procedures by the staff at Meadowfield Hospital. Failures relating to admission process, understanding of existing diagnoses, risk management, record keeping, family involvement and discharge planning prevented Morgan from receiving access to services she needed at the time. We consider it probable that if policies and procedures had been followed Morgan would have benefitted from a level of care more closely aligned to her complex needs, including her diagnosis of Autism. In the days running up to Morgan's death, there was a failure to act professionally by some members of hospital staff. Following an earlier incident of assault, the deceased's attempts to apologise were not handled in a professional manner by senior staff members of Rowan Ward, leading to a fractured therapeutic relationship. Whilst nursing staff did not actively exclude Morgan from receiving care, the situation was made unnecessarily stressful for Morgan. The evidence of the court focused on the frequency of observations on the night of Morgan's death. However, whilst it's possible that more frequent observations may have helped to better understand her level of risk, we feel it more probable that better quality observations and interactions would have led to a great understanding of Morgan's state of mind.","Morgan had been struggling with her mental health for some time, but there had been a marked deterioration at the end of January 2023 due to various factors. From January 2023 she had, on a number of occasions, self-harmed and made attempts to take her life in the community, whilst detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983, and whilst a voluntary inpatient. During this time, Morgan was admitted and discharged from mental health settings, through the consultant led discharge process and via Morgan self-discharging. On the 27 February 2023 Morgan experienced a psychotic episode which resulted in hospital staff being injured. As a result of this episode, Morgan self-discharged herself. Whilst in the hospital grounds Morgan attempted to hang herself from a tree and on this occasion, she was detained by the Police under Section 136 Mental Health Act 1983. Morgan was detained in the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit under Section 2 and after assessment the section was rescinded and she was then transferred to Rowan ward on the 3 March 2023, where she remained as a voluntary inpatient. It was assessed that Morgan should be discharged into the community under the care of the Crisis Team on the 6 th March 2023. Whilst waiting for a discharge meeting with the Crisis Team on the 9 th March, in the early hours of the morning, Morgan sadly [REDACTED] hung herself.","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- There is no policy or guidance to staff for the assessment of risk posed by fixtures and fittings supplied by the Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust). There is therefore the risk that fixtures and fittings supplied and/or not removed by the Trust from patients, who are suffering from acute mental health, are at risk of utilising these items to take their own life. 6"

NG21 2DT","On 29 th April 2024 an inquest was opened into the death of Paul Ian Taylor, aged 58. The inquest concluded on 17 th December 2024. I made a determination at inquest that he died as a result of suicide.","Paul Taylor had been under police investigation for offences that necessitated consideration of the Suicide Prevention and Risk Management of Suspects policy, Nottinghamshire Police document PS260, by the police. That policy was complied with. It was appropriate not to arrest Mr Taylor at the outset of the investigation, so he was voluntarily interviewed and he was released under investigation for a two year period. Within a fortnight of him being made aware that criminal charges had been authorised, he intentionally took a large quantity of prescription medication and was found deceased at his home address on 3 January 2024.","; When a suspect is arrested for offences requiring a referral to a mental health nurse, commonly referred to in Nottinghamshire as “Liaison and Diversion” the custody sergeant makes that referral automatically, which allows the opportunity for a suspect to obtain assistance from a healthcare professional, if they desire. In addition, there are welfare assessments conducted by the officer in charge of the investigation. In cases where a suspect is interviewed on a voluntary basis for relevant offences, the suspect is not dealt with at a custody suite and a referral to a mental health nurse is not automatic. In this latter scenario, only welfare assessments are completed by the officer in charge of the investigation without any involvement from healthcare services. A policy revision is being undertaken to ensure that the procedures for supporting and safeguarding suspects of relevant offences are consistent, irrespective of whether the individual has been arrested or invited for voluntary attendance. In both scenarios, suspects receive an officer welfare assessment together with an automatic referral to Liaison and Diversion (healthcare services). The amendment to the policy and communication to the organisation will be implemented by 1st March 2025. Yours sincerely, Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire Police"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 th December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Williamson died from dry drowning and took his own life whilst experiencing hopelessness in the investigation and treatment of pelvic pain.","Mr Williamson began to suffer from lower urinary tract symptoms towards the end of 2022. Until that time, he had been fit and healthy and was working full time. Specialist urological investigations began in January 2023 and by March 2023 a diagnosis of chronic prostatitis was made. The condition adversely affected his life, his business and his mental health such that he was diagnosed by his GP with anxiety in April 2023. Further urological investigations in May 2023 did not reveal any sinister cause of the symptoms and he was started on antidepressant medication by his GP. He had repeated consultations with his GP arising from the stress and pain associated with his condition and was diagnosed by the endocrinology team in July 2023 with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), but subsequent tests did not identify a cause. He began to experience suicidal thoughts in early July 2023 and continued to consult his GP through August 2023 with increasing suicidal thoughts arising from the physical symptoms and pain. He attended A&E on 21 st August 2023, where the symptoms were attributed to chronic prostatitis and he was referred back to GP in relation to his mental health. At the instigation of his GP, Mr Williamson attended A&E for an urgent mental health assessment by the Mental Health Liaison Team in light of his increasing suicidal thoughts which resulted in follow up by the Home Based Treatment Team (HBTT) and a referral for talking therapy. On 1 st September 2023, as a result of a follow-up consultation with the urology team, Mr Williamson was referred to the Pain Service. The urology team had not further plans to see him again, having exhausted their investigations. On 4 th September 2023, Mr Williamson was reported to the police by his family to be missing from home. He had by that time ceased his business due to the medical and mental health issues and on that day, he took the car keys from home, which his wife had been keeping from him in order to keep him safe. . He presented himself to hospital some hours later and told the police that he had been unable to kill himself because he could not think of a way to do so without involving a third party. He expressed the view that his physical health problems were not being taken seriously and that he had previously tried to jump from a moving car. The mental health assessment resulted in an overnight admission to a mental health ward. On discharge, he came under the care of the HBTT and remained so until 19 th December 2023. The physical symptoms, pain and an increasing sense of futility were the theme of the following weeks with suicidal ideation resulting. Mr Williamson's wife obtained an urgent appointment with the Pain Service on 7 th November 2023 for chronic pelvic pain. That consultation resulted in a referral to the specialist pelvic physiotherapist for assessment and a change of medication. The physiotherapy appointment did not take place before 19 th December 2023. However, the following day, the HBTT adjusted the antidepressant medication again without liaison with the Pain Service. On 13 th November 2023, Mr Williamson told his GP that he had threatened to slash his wrists with a knife the previous evening and that the change in his medication was adversely affecting him. On 19 th November 2023, Mr Williamson was taken to A&E by his family because they feared he was about to jump from a window at home. He was assessed and admitted to a mental health ward for the second time as a voluntary patient remaining there until he discharged himself against advice on 24 th November 2023 due to the conditions on the ward, which has since been closed. Immediately after his discharge, he absconded and was found by the police and his family at a local water park where he had intended to drown himself. He was seen by the HBTT two days later but was not made the subject of daily monitoring. He was assessed by the consultant psychiatrist from the HBTT on 30 th November 2023 and by this time, Mr Williamson's family were keeping him locked in the house for his own safety. Mr Williamson was catheterised at A&E due to urine retention on 8 th December 2023. On 12 th December 2023, Mr Williamson and his wife told the HBTT member visiting him that they perceived a disconnection between the medical and mental health teams in relation to his care and requested liaison between the HBTT and urology to achieve coordination. That request was raised within the HBTT and a further request made by the HBTT member on 17 th December 2023 to the medical doctor attached to the HBTT but no such liaison took place. The evidence at the inquest was that the HBTT largely relied upon Mr Williamson himself and his family for their understanding of the involvement, investigation and treatment by the medical teams. The medical specialties relied on the GP being a “hub” for communication by way of discharge and clinic letters, which were copied to Mr Williamson. The inquest found that the absence of a collaborative and coordinated approach between medical and mental health teams contributed to a feeling of hopelessness in Mr Williamson. Mr Williamson left his home on foot having climbed through a window on 19 th December 2023 and the finding of the inquest was that he entered an unidentified stretch of extremely cold water some time afterwards. The medical cause of his death was dry drowning due to a laryngeal spasm caused by the effect of immersion in cold water. His body was found on 17 th March 2024 in the River Mersey some miles from his home.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the 3 circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Throughout the inquest, it was apparent that save for the referral by the Urology team to the Pain Service in September 2023, there was no liaison or communication between any of the specialties involved in Mr Williamson's care, which resulted in a lack of understanding on the part of each specialty of the plans and actions of the others. The inquest was told that there is a significant proportion of patients who are referred to the Pain Service who suffer poor mental health and who are therefore also under the care of mental health teams in the community. The inquest heard that there is no formal framework (other than in cancer care and one specialist area of surgery) either locally or nationally to facilitate inter-specialty communication, particularly in complex and dynamic cases and further, that the existing channels of communication are more problematic between different NHS Trusts even within the same geographical area. 6"

Matty identified as non-binary and preferred the use of the pronouns they and them. The investigation concluded with the Inquest being held over a two-week period which concluded on Friday 13 th December 2024. At the end of the Inquest, I concluded that: On 3rd November 2022 at around 02.21 Matty had attended Accident & Emergency at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in crisis following a further deterioration in their mental health. This was the second admission in no less than 5 weeks. During this second admission they were experiencing intense suicidal thoughts. Later on 4th November 2022 they were formally assessed under the Mental Health Act and the decision taken was not to detain them. Provision was however made for Matty to be able to stay in the hospital that night if they wished. However, Matty left shortly afterwards and tied a ligature around their neck and suspended themself from [REDACTED]. Their intentions at the time of carrying out this act remain unclear. The following issues contributed to their death:- 1. The fact that Matty's private housing accommodation, which had been arranged following their move to Brighton, was not suitable due to their ongoing sensory issues. 2. The fact that there had been no psychiatric bed available to Matty during their first admission to Accident and Emergency Department in September. They stayed in the Accident and Emergency department for 26 days during their admission between 5th and 30th September 2022. This meant that there was no meaningful therapeutic input at that time. 3. The fact that Accident and Emergency Department was not a suitable environment for a neurodivergent individual and the 26-day period of their stay contributed to the deterioration of their mental health difficulties. 4. The fact that there was a general lack of inpatient bed provision for informal patients and in particular for those who are autistic and non- binary who require to be on a mixed ward. 5. The fact that Matty was discharged from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team on 18th October 2022 before being picked up by Assessment and Treatment Service. This left a gap in service provision for Matty. 6. The rigidity of the referral process to Transforming Care in Autism team (TCAT) meant that Matty was unable to access specialist advice and resources whilst in A&E or in the community. 7. The fact that the mental health assessment carried out during this second admission did not take into account the following:- – The views and observations of the nearest relative, Matty's mother. – Matty's preferred communication aids and in particular Matty's communication book. – The need for Matty to have an advocate present during the assessment and give consideration to the use of idiosyncratic language. – The extent of Matty's deteriorating mental state and their increasing risks in the context of their neurodivergence. – The fact that Matty's change of behaviour during the assessment may be due to:- a) the fact that Matty had been given diazepam b) the fact that Matty may have been able to mask their distress. – Too much emphasis was placed on Matty's presentation within the assessment itself. 8. There was a lack of discharge care planning documented after the assessment on 4th November 2022 particularly if Matty decided to leave before the morning. This led to confusion within the A&E department when Matty decided to leave the hospital.","Matty had struggled with their mental health throughout their adult life, but it wasn't until 2019 that Matty was finally diagnosed with Autism, ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorder. However, they had never been sectioned under the Mental Health Act or had spent time as a voluntary patient in a mental health hospital. Matty had moved to Brighton from Surrey in November 2021 having wanted to live independently. He was drawn to Brighton as they wished to be involved in the trans/non-binary community. Matty's mental health deteriorated during the summer of 2022 due to accommodation issues that they had been facing and issues with an online relationship. By 3 rd September they were in crisis. On 5 th September 2022 Matty was admitted to A&E at the Royal County Hospital, Brighton. They remained within A&E, short stay ward, for 26 days awaiting a psychiatric bed. During this time no bed was found, and they were eventually discharged back home with support from the Crisis Home Treatment Team. Matty's mental health had been affected by the unsuitability of the environment within A&E for someone awaiting an inpatient mental health bed. Less than 5 weeks later Matty was again admitted to the A&E department at the Royal Sussex County Hospital on 3 rd November 2022 in crisis. Their presentation fluctuated and this led to them being assessed under the Mental Health Act. However, they were not found to be detainable. They left the hospital shortly after the assessment and were sadly found hanging in the grounds of the hospital.","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. There is a lack of inpatient beds leading to unacceptable wait times in A&E for those suffering with their mental health who are awaiting beds. In Matty's case a bed was not found for them within a 26-day period. 2. There being a national shortage of mental health beds in particular Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 for Autistic patients and those who are transgender requiring a mixed ward. 3. The unsuitability of the environment of A&E as a holding place for those in need of a mental health bed. The environment in A&E as a holding place is not conducive for those suffering with Autism and/or who are neurodiverse. The environment in A&E can exacerbate their mental health. 4. There is a gap in services for those who do not meet the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act but who are too high a risk to be sent home. 5. There is a significant wait time for referral to the Assessment and Treatment Service. Therefore, any therapeutic input is delayed, and this results in repetitive attendances at A&E when in crisis. 6"

The fact that Matty was discharged from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team on 18th October 2022 before being picked up by Assessment and Treatment Service. This left a gap in service provision for Matty. 6. The rigidity of the referral process to Transforming Care in Autism team (TCAT) meant that Matty was unable to access specialist advice and resources whist in A&E or in the community. 7. The fact that the mental health assessment carried out during this second admission did not take into account the following:- – The views and observations of the nearest relative, Matty's mother. – – Matty's preferred communication aids and in particular Matty's communication book. – The need for Matty to have an advocate present during the assessment and give consideration to the use of idiosyncratic language. – The extent of Matty's deteriorating mental state and their increasing risks in the context of their neurodivergence. – The fact that Matty's change of behaviour during the assessment may be due to:- a) the fact that Matty had been given diazepam b) the fact that Matty may have been able to mask their distress. – Too much emphasis was placed on Matty's presentation within the assessment itself. 8. There was a lack of discharge care planning documented after the assessment on 4th November 2022 particularly if Matty decided to leave before the morning. This led to confusion within the A&E department when Matty decided to leave the hospital.","Matty had struggled with their mental health throughout their adult life, but it wasn't until 2019 that Matty was finally diagnosed with Autism. ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorder. However, they had never been sectioned under the Mental Health Act or had spent time as a voluntary patient in a mental health hospital. Matty had moved to Brighton from Surrey in November 2021 having wanted to live independently. They were drawn to Brighton as they wished to be involved in the trans/non-binary community. Matty's mental health deteriorated during the summer of 2022 due to accommodation issues that they had been facing and issues with an online relationship. By 3 rd September they were in crisis. On 5 th September 2022 Matty was admitted to A&E at the Royal County Hospital, Brighton. They remained within A&E, short stay ward, for 26 days awaiting a psychiatric bed. During this time no bed was found, and they were eventually discharged back home with support from the Crisis Home Treatment Team. Matty's mental health had been affected by the unsuitability of the environment within A&E for someone awaiting an inpatient mental health bed. Less than 5 weeks later Matty was again admitted to the A&E department at the Royal Sussex County Hospital on 3 rd November 2022 in crisis. Their presentation fluctuated and this led to them being assessed under the Mental Health Act. However, they were not found to be detainable. They left the hospital shortly after the assessment and were sadly found hanging in the grounds of the hospital.","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The lack of inpatient beds leading to the unacceptable wait time in A&E for those suffering with their mental health who are awaiting beds. In Matty's case a bed was not found for them within a 26-day period. 2. There being a shortage of beds for Autistic patients (both informal and detained) within the private sector that are being funded by the Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 ICB. Evidence was heard that those providing beds within the public sector very often refused to accept autistic patients due to their additional risks. 3. There being a shortage of beds for transgender patients who are in need of a mixed ward. 4. In Matty's case it appears there was a lack of appreciation by the ICB of his extensive length of stay in A&E. It appears that this information (and others who had lengthy stays) was not at that time being collected, monitored and acted on by the ICB. 5. The unsuitability of the environment of A&E as a holding place for those in need of a mental health bed. The evidence was that the environment in A&E as a holding place is not conducive for those suffering with Autism and/or who are neurodiverse. The environment in A&E can exacerbate and cause further deterioration in their mental health. 6. There is a gap in services for those who are not ill enough to be detained but who are too high risk to be sent home. 7. There is a significant wait time for referral to the Assessment and Treatment Service. Therefore, any therapeutic input is delayed, and this results in repetitive attendances at A&E when in crisis. 8. Current gaps in service around psychosocial support for transgender, non-binary and intersex adults have been provided by third party charitable organisations. It is understood that much of their funding has recently been withdrawn by the ICB. This is of particular concern as Brighton is recognised as having one of the largest trans communities in the Country 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:- The effects of a self-ignited fire at his home address, whilst suffering a relapse of his known psychotic illness. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Smoke inhalation and severe burns 1b Domestic fire 2 Paranoid schizophrenia, severe right coronary artery atherosclerosis","Timothy De Boos was declared deceased at his home address in Ipswich, Suffolk on the 6″ February 2024. Earlier that day a fire had to be seen coming from the ground floor flat of the address. Tim was seen by a witness to close the window of the flat whilst it was on fire, then disappear from view. Tim made no attempt to leave, and when found was sat or slumped against the door of the room. Timothy was known to the mental health services, and had a prolonged history of being mentally unwell (being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2004), with evidence of a previous stated suicidal thought. A subsequent post-mortem examination identified that Tim had died from smoke inhalation and burns. Although clearly able to do so Tim made no effort to leave the burning building, and on a balance of probabilities basis, deliberately remained inside with a view to ending his life Tim had suffered a mental health crisis on the 2 February 2024 and Tim himself, Tim's family, and Tim's Mental Health Care Coordinator, all believed he should be admitted to a Mental Health Unit at that time as a voluntary patient. This could not be immediately actioned as a referral to another team was required, and members of that team who subsequently saw Tim the following day, deemed he was no longer in a mental health crisis. If Tim's admission to hospital had been actioned on the 2″” February 2024, he could not have been admitted in any event, as there was already a list of five other individuals waiting to be admitted to the same unit. Had Tim been admitted to a Mental Health Unit on the 2″” February 2024, his tragic death would not have occurred.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you;
the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows.  -

1. I am concerned of the continuing lack of Mental Health Unit inpatient beds in Suffolk, and more widely throughout England and Wales.

At the time of Tim's mental health crisis on the 2nd February 2024, had the decision to admit him been possible, he still would not have been admitted as there were five other individuals in the queue before him also waiting for admission.

The lack of available beds is not a new problem, and I have previously issued two Regulation 28 Prevention of Future Death Reports in which a lack of inpatient Mental Health Unit beds have contributed to a death-

Nicola Rayner (died 10th June 2023), reported 7th March 2024.

Piotr Kierzkowski (died 17th December 2019), reported 12th October 2020.

2. In Tim's case, on the 2nd of February 2024 Tim's family, Tim himself, and Tim's Mental Health Care Coordinator (a Senior Mental Health Nurse who had been supporting Tim for a year), all wished for his admission to a Mental Health Unit as a voluntary patient.

It was heard in evidence that a different team (the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team) were the 'gatekeepers' for admission and this team could not review Tim until the next day.

When reviewed by Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team staff (who had never met Tim before), they believed his crisis had subsided and his admission was denied.

In evidence Tim's Mental Health Care Coordinator was adamant that Tim should have been hospitalised on the 2nd February, as both his family and Tim himself had also wished.

I am therefore concerned that the views of an experienced mental health professional, a patient's family, and the patient themselves, is deemed insufficient evidence for an admission to a Mental Health Unit as a voluntary inpatient."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide 1a Bilateral transection of the ulnar arteries 1b Incised wounds to the wrists,"David Stables had a history of mental health issues and had taken two drug overdoses in 2020. He was prescribed sertraline in April 2020 and weaned himself off this in 2023. His last prescription was issued in July 2023. David attended many appointments at his GP practice from 2020 to 2023 regarding other issues unrelated to his mental health. In most of these encounters there is no record of any discussions regarding his mental health. Whilst he received repeat prescriptions for his sertraline, there is no recorded entry of a review of his mental health or appropriateness of the medication. It is noted that he had reduced this himself yet there is no recorded entry of a full review of his mental health at this time. I am concerned that there were no recorded mental health or medication reviews from April 2020 until February 2024 when David attended the GP asking for help. I was unable to establish whether these reviews had taken place and just not been recorded or whether full mental health reviews had not taken place when they should have been. In February 2024 he attended the GP surgery and had a face to face appointment regarding his mental health. He had anxiety and had difficulties in sleeping and poor appetite. A shared decision was undertaken to put David on mirtazapine at 15mg and to follow up in 4 weeks time. I was informed that this was considered because of its side effects of sedation and increased appetite. A full mental state examination was undertaken which did not identify any Self harm or suicidal concerns. On 18 March 2024 he was seen again by the GP and there was some improvement. I was told that self harm and suicidal ideation were specifically discussed and they were strongly denied at both appointments. There was no concern from the GP when he called 2 days later to ask to increase his medication although it was accepted that had she known he had tried to contact the GP surgery on 5 th 14 and 15 th March then this may have changed her management in terms of obtaining more information either by reception or by another appointment. However, I do find that whilst he may have attempted to contact the GP it cannot be ascertained if these calls actually made it through to the reception team. I find that there is no evidence to say that this would have changed the management in terms of the medication although it may have been considered. Further there is evidence that even if medication had been increased it could have taken up to 4 – 6 weeks to show any benefit. David had been given all relevant safety netting advice for a crisis and this was provided verbally and by text message.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The conclusion of the inquest was Suspension by a ligature contributed to by neglect.,"Kay arrived at HMP Eastwood Park on 15th June 2022. It was her first time in prison and she had a history of autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a personality disorder. She arrived with a suicide and self-harm warning form having been completed as she had tried to [REDACTED]. Staff started a suicide and self-harm monitoring process referred to as an ACCT. Initially Kay was placed on the prison induction wing, subsequently she was moved to Residential Unit 3. During her time at the prison she continued to self-harm, she banged her head, she punched herself, she made scratches and cuts to herself, she made ligatures and was found with them on two occasions. She found it difficult to cope with the noisy environment and prison regime. On 21st June a neurodiversity specialist met her and created a communications support plan for her. This set out the difficulties she had with noise, smells, food, and physical contact, it suggested ways for people to understand and interact with her. On 4th July Kay cut her arms in the morning, a nurse cleaned her wounds and Kay handed to her a ligature that she had made. At around 6.30pm Kay could not be found and after a search she was located hiding under a table in the association room. She refused to go back to her cell. She was restrained and carried back to her cell by officers. At 7.26pm 3 officers went into her cell and found her hanging, she was cut down and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation is commenced. Paramedics arrive and she is then taken to Southmead Hospital. Kay died on 7th July 2022. During her numerous ACCT case reviews her care plan with support action was never completed. After the control and restraint constant observations were not considered. There was little understanding by the prison staff of Kay's neurodiversity.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

1. To HMP Eastwood Park and The Ministry of Justice - training issues in relation to the following areas for new and existing staff:
    a. Neurodiversity, I am told 75% of women in prison have mental health or neurodiverse issues, this training is not mandatory;
    b. ACCT, there was little understanding of the requirement to complete or review the care plan and support actions at every ACCT review not just the planned reviews;
    c. Little or no understanding of when constant supervision can be used and how is it used;
2. Healthcare (AWP and PPG): training issues arose in relation to, when attending ACCT reviews that they check the care plan with support actions part of the document is reviewed and if necessary updated; it was suggested that consideration could be made to making changes to the system-one database to check this step has been taken.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 2 December 2024. The conclusion was that Mr Ford died as a result of suicide.,"Mr. Ford suffered a decline in his mental health on the 1 March 2024. He was suffering from intrusive thoughts relating to past trauma. His partner was concerned about his mental health and contacted the secondary care crisis team in the very early hours of the 2 March 2024. Mr. Ford spoke with the crisis contact. The crisis team did not take a full history or carry out a full risk formulation. Mr. Ford was informed that he would be referred to the community mental health team. The referral was made, but on the 4 March 2024 the referral for secondary care mental health services was declined. The reasons for declining the referral were not set out in the records or in the letter to the general practitioner. No further information was sought from Mr. Ford or from his partner before declining the referral. There was no formulation of risk in accordance with the relevant NICE guidelines (issued in September 2022), before declining access to secondary mental health services. It is not possible to determine, on the balance of probabilities, what decisions would have been made by the community mental health team, had a full risk formulation been carried out on 4 March 2024. It is therefore not possible to state on the balance of probabilities that a full risk formulation on 4 March 2024 would have prevented Mr Ford's death on 10 March 2024. On the 6 March 2024, Mr. Ford had a telephone consultation with his GP. He explained that he had experienced suicidal thoughts on the 1 March 2024, but stated that he would not act on these thoughts. He described clear protective factors. The GP prescribed anti- depressants and a review appointment was set for the 20 March 2024. Crisis information was also provided by the GP. On the evening of the 9 March 2024, Mr. Ford had a disagreement with his partner. At around 0850 on the 10 March 2024 he left home. At 1035 he is seen on CCTV buying a length of rope. At 1350 he was found hanging in Bedfords Park, Romford. Emergency services were called and paramedics pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. There were no substances found on toxicology which would have prevented Mr. Ford from forming an intention to take his own life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Despite clear guidance from NICE in September 2022 relating to the need for a holistic formulation of risk to self, two NELFT teams involved in Mr Ford's crisis care failed to carry out a holistic formulation of the risk he posed to himself. (2) A clinical lead for the mental health and wellbeing team within NELFT, gave evidence at the inquest in December 2024 that Mr Ford's risk was deemed to be low because “the main factor around risk is that he denied any risk to self and denied any suicidal thoughts”. This simplistic assessment of risk is not compliant with the NICE guidelines. It is of concern that a senior member - clinical lead - within the mental health and wellbeing team is not applying the correct risk formulation. (3) The Trust carries out risk assessment audits for clients who are accepted into the mental health and wellbeing team. There are no audits into the risk assessments for those persons who are referred to the team, but not accepted by the team. As these patients have no safety net of ongoing mental healthcare, it is of concern that the quality of risk assessments for these 3 patients is not audited. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: The deceased ended his life by suicide. The assessment of the level of risk posed was appropriate as was the overall plan to address this risk. However there was a failure to pass on all of the pertinent risk management information to those making decisions; the full purpose of asking the deceased to return to barracks was not communicated effectively to him, protective factors mitigating the resulting lack of proximity to family, including meeting him or assessing his welfare on arrival, were not considered. These factors taken together may possibly have contributed to his death on that day.","On the 11th September 2023 Charlie Anthony Owen was found deceased in his room at the Combermere Barracks, Windsor. On the 5th September 2023 he had taken action to end his own life which he aborted and sought help from his lieutenant. This was the second time that he had made, and aborted, an attempt to end his own life; both of which occurred in the context of relationship breakdown. The army arranged a medical and mental health assessment and Charlie denied current intent to end his life in all subsequent conversations with medical and army personnel. Charlie was still assessed as posing a risk to himself and was called back to his battalion. This was for further assessment and treatment as well as a return to work. Not all relevant information was shared and considered when plans were made for his return. He left his family home in Wales on the 10th September; having prepared notes indicating an intent to end his life at some point prior to this. After returning to barracks he hung himself.",During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Vulnerability Risk Management (VRM) process I heard evidence that the army VRM guidance does not invite those attending case conferences to consider 'checking in' or meeting those assessed as posing a risk of self-harm on return to their unit. In this inquest no consideration was given to this possibility even though Charlie posed an elevated level of risk and had been initially placed under the VRM process whilst at home. This gives rise to a concern that the army does not know where soldiers who pose a risk are and does not facilitate additional support that may be necessary. I accept the evidence I heard that different units will have different requirements but this would not prevent them from giving consideration of this issue. Training I heard that suicide prevention training is not mandatory for army welfare officers/welfare NCOs. This gives rise to a concern that those specifically tasked to deal with people who are most likely to pose a risk of suicide or self harm are not best equipped to identify this and assist the individual. I heard evidence regarding the VRM process training. I am concerned that there is insufficient focus in that training on the actual aim including reducing risk and preventing suicide. A better understanding of risks and the purpose of VRM seems likely to assist those tasked with running it. Information sharing Witnesses for the army have noted that information sharing between medical and command personnel poses challenges. I am concerned that the VRM process does not require adequate documentation of the information shared. The lack of detail contained within the case conference notes hindered this inquest's ability to establish precisely what risk information was shared. This gives rise to a concern that audits of effectiveness and potential learning points are being missed. I was concerned to hear that when a risk management and safety plan has been prepared by the Defence mental health services the information contained about relevant protective factors and safety actions is not necessarily shared with the Chain of Command. There is no prompt on the relevant template to remind of team of the potential benefit of sharing this information or requesting consent from the individual in question to do so which gives rise to a concern that this important information is not shared. 6

It appears that he had hoarded some of his medication and also appears to have acquired 112 tablets on or around 29 th November 2023 due to a prescribing error where he changed his choice of chemist from an online pharmacy ('Pharmacy2U') to a local 'Superdrug' store. His Surgery, Clare House Surgery, Tiverton sent an electronic request to Pharmacy2U to cancel the prescription and then issued the second to Superdrug; however, Pharmacy2U had already “pulled down” the prescription before it was cancelled electronically. They then dispatched 112 x 75mg [REDACTED] to Oliver by post on 28 th November.

He had a long-established history of issues with his mental health including anxiety, depression, self-harm and previous suicidal ideation. He was also aware of his own impulsiveness. A note was found by a police officer attending Oliver's flat on the day he died which stated that he did not have control over his medication and would take them all if left unsupervised.

The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:- Suicide as the result of a deterioration in her mental health, exacerbated by an ineffective PRN medication prescription which failed to resolve her heightened anxiety crisis when needed. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Fatal Pressure on Neck","Amy Butcher was declared deceased at 07:26 hours on the 14 th May 2023 at [REDACTED] in Suffolk. Amy had been found inside the premises, [REDACTED]. Amy was being treated by Mental Health services and had four days earlier (10 th May 2024) been admitted to A&E in a heightened anxiety crisis and wanting to die. At this time Amy was given Lorazepam (a 'pro re nata' [PRN] 'take as needed' medication). This medication was very effective for her, and once her anxiety crisis had passed, she was allowed home. Following her discharge Amy had consultations with her mental health crisis team and her GP, and made repeated requests for a prescription of Lorazepam, to take as a PRN medicine, if she suffered a further heightened anxiety crisis. Taking a PRN medication was one of the steps identified in Amy's agreed crisis plan. Amy's request for Lorazepam was declined, and alternative PRN medications where subsequently prescribed. On the evening of the 13 th May 2024 Amy was particularly distressed, and it took her partner hours to calm her down, until Amy finally fell asleep. At some point Amy had taken her prescribed PRN medication (as evidenced in subsequent toxicology analysis), but in the early hours of the 14 th May 2023, Amy awoke and suspended herself with a ligature around her neck. Amy's prescribed PRN medication had therefore not alleviated her heightened anxiety crisis. Had Amy had access to Lorazepam as a PRN medication on the evening of the 13 th May 2023 (knowing the positive outcome this had for her on the 10 th May 2023), it is more likely than not, that her death would not have occurred. Notes written by Amy, and disclosed to the Mental Health on the 8 th May 2023, addressed to her loved ones, indicate that she premediated thoughts about taking her life, and therefore intended her death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. Evidence heard at inquest identified a muddled and unclear system for the prescription of medication to someone in Amy's situation. The Emergency Department Consultant who saw Amy in crisis on the 10th May 2024 stated that for patients like Amy she had previously prescribed Lorazepam upon discharge home, but could only do this if the Mental Health Team in the ED requested her to do so, which they did not do on this occasion. The following day, Amy herself tried to obtain a prescription of Lorazepam by dialling NHS 111 Option 2 (Mental Health line). She spoke to a mental health practitioner who told her that NHS 111 Option 2 did not have the ability to prescribe medication, and she would need to call NHS 111 Option 1 and speak to an Out of Hours GP instead. Amy contacted NHS 111 Option 1 and spoke to an Out of Hours GP, who worked for a private company which had implemented a ban on the prescription of Lorazepam due to its highly addictive properties. As such, even if the GP had considered Lorazepam to be required in Amy's case, he could not have prescribed it. The GP prescribed different PRN medications, which were subsequently found in Amy's system after her death. Amy's own GP gave evidence stating that the system for prescribing mental health medication was confusing. He stated that mental health medications prescribed to a patient by a GP (such as antidepressants) before a Mental Health Team became involved, remained the responsibility of the GP. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 However, once a Mental Health Team became involved, any changes to the medication regime could only be made by the Mental Health Team. In addition, some medication would be prescribed by the Mental Health Team directly, whilst other would be prescribed separately by the GP. The GP described the situation as one of there simply being 'too many chiefs'. The net effect of the current system in place is that an individual in Amy's situation finds themselves needing to make multiple telephone calls or contacts with NHS 111 Option 1, NHS 111 Option 2, their Out of Hours GP Service, their own GP and their Mental Health Team, in order to try and obtain either a new prescription or change their current prescription if their mental health suddenly deteriorates. There is evidently no single point of contact, or single decision maker regarding prescriptions in these cases. The evidence suggests that the situation is exacerbated even further if the individual's mental health deterioration occurs Out of Hours. 2. Evidence was heard that a decision had been made by the Mental Health Multi-Disciplinary Team that Lorazepam was not to be prescribed to Amy in any event. The court heard that Lorazepam was highly addictive and the subject of frequent misuse by individuals to whom it was prescribed. There were two reasons given for the MDT decision. Firstly, Amy had volunteered to the Mental Health Team, that she had previously purchased online a 'micro dose of hallucinogenic mushrooms' to try and alleviate her systems. The court heard that like 'homeopathic medication' only a tiny amount of the active hallucinogen found in mushrooms would have been present, but that it was still illegal to possess this in the UK. Amy had told the team that she had only used this once. The MDT decision was that because this was an illegal drug, because the MDT were unaware that micro dosing of hallucinogenic mushrooms was being used by mental health patients, and because they did not know how it would react with the Lorazepam, no Lorazepam was to be prescribed to Amy. Secondly, Amy had previously disposed of medications prescribed to her which made her feel worse (a known side effect of some medications in the first few days of taking them). When advised to restart them, repeat prescriptions had to be made. In addition, just prior to her death Amy volunteered that she had been taking a sleeping tablet (Zopiclone) in the mornings, as well as taking them when she was supposed to at night. Amy had said that her current PRN medication had no effect, but the Zopiclone did help. As a result, it was recorded by the MDT that Amy was 'non-concordant' with her medication regime, therefore making her a higher risk of prescription misuse. However, in her evidence, the Emergency Department Consultant said she was fully aware of the fact that micro dosing of hallucinogenic mushrooms was being used by mental health patients, and that due to the tiny amount Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 of active hallucinogen it was generally not a barrier to the prescription of any other medication. In addition, the Emergency Department Consultant stated that if an individual had ingested a toxic quantity of hallucinogenic mushrooms, there was no contra-indication for the prescription of Lorazepam as it was often prescribed to reduce the hallucinogenic effects. In the evidence heard from members of the MDT, it was clear that the illegal use of a 'micro dose of hallucinogenic mushrooms' coupled with Amy's non-concordance, led to the decision not to prescribe her Lorazepam. As such, a lack of knowledge in relation to the common usage of micro dose hallucinogenic mushrooms as a self-treatment by mental health patients, a lack of knowledge in relation to there being no contra- indications for the prescription of Lorazepam if micro dose hallucinogenic mushrooms were being used, and defining Amy as 'non-concordant' due to her use of Zopiclone when her PRN medication proved ineffective, prevented a realistic opportunity for the MDT to consider if Lorazepam should have been prescribed to Amy. 6"

The Chief Executive of NHS Dorset 1,"On the 4 th April 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Emma Victoria Sanders, aged 34 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 18 th November 2024. The medical cause of death was: Ia Hypoxic Brain Encephalopathy Ib Asphyxia The conclusion of the Inquest was a narrative conclusion that Emma Victoria Sanders died as a consequence of the self-application of a ligature to her neck, in circumstances where her intention remains unclear.","Emma had a complex mental health history with confirmed diagnoses of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and was known to regularly self harm by a variety of means. Emma had a history of opiate dependence and on the 22nd February 2023, she began a period in a detoxification and rehabilitation placement in Cornwall in order to become abstinent from methadone so she could progress to therapy treatment for her mental health diagnoses. Prior to this she had experienced a period of relative stability with her mental health. During this placement the methadone prescription was reduced more quickly than she had experienced before, and she became emotionally dysregulated. Her mental health deteriorated, and her acts of self harm increased as a result of which she was taken to the local hospital in Cornwall. The placement was ended on the 7th March as it was felt her risks were too high to be managed in that setting. On the 14th March 2023 Emma was taken to the Emergency Department at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth after she disclosed that she had taken an overdose of her prescribed medication. At this time the hospital was experiencing extreme capacity pressures and Emma was placed in the cohorting corridor which was being staffed by paramedics due to the capacity pressures. At 18.58 hours, when for a very short period of time there were no staff in the corridor, Emma can be seen on the CCTV of the corridor to secret upon her person a nasal canula with plastic tubing from an equipment trolley. At 19.53 hours Emma went to the toilet in the Emergency Department. At 20.03 hours, Emma was found in a collapsed and unresponsive condition on the floor of the toilet with a ligature fashioned from nasal canula tubing around her neck. Following attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation there was a return of spontaneous circulation, and she was admitted to the critical care unit at the hospital where she continued to receive care, however her condition deteriorated, and she died on the 19th March 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. At the time of her death Emma had a Frequent Attender Care plan, or as they are now known a High Intensity Use Care Plan, in place. This plan was agreed by representatives from Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (DHUFT) who provide the mental health care across Dorset, a representative from the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, a representative from Poole Hospital and a representative from We Are With You (WAWY) who supported Emma with her substance misuse. The aims of this plan for Emma were: • to provide a consistent approach when Emma presented to the emergency department • to streamline her care so that she does not have to wait any longer than necessary in the ED as she has identified this makes her feel worse • to minimise the impact on emergency department resources when Emma attends • to reduce the use of restrictive interventions which may exacerbate Emma's distress ii. South West Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWAST), who provide the paramedic care in the South West, were not provided with the plan prior to the 14th March 2023, nor were other hospitals Emma may present to, such as the other local hospital in Dorset, Dorset County Hospital, or the hospital in 3 Cornwall where Emma was taken to when she self harmed on the 5th March 2023 during her time at the detoxification and rehabilitation placement. iii. On the 14th March 2023, due to the capacity issues the cohorting area was opened at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital and representatives from SWAST were caring for the patients in the cohorting area. When Emma arrived at the hospital, she was taken to the cohorting area and was booked into the hospital by the triage nurse from the hospital, although was not seen by them and her previous records were not accessed. iv. There can be a delay in accessing the hospital patient record when a patient arrives at the hospital as following the booking in process, there needs to be a merger of the ambulance paperwork to verify they have the correct person before the hospital patient record can be accessed. The process adopted by different hospitals may cause a delay in access to the hospital patient record and evidence was given that at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital this could be anything up to 10 minutes from experience. v. When Emma arrived at the hospital she was booked in by the triage nurse between 18.49 and 18.52 hours, however the merger of her records did not happen until 18.59 hours. No representative from the hospital saw Emma prior to her death and she was monitored by the SWAST paramedics in the cohorting area, so there was no access to her patient record which detailed her significant history of self harm and the Frequent Attender Care Plan. The Frequent Attender Care Plan was not followed throughout the 1 hour and 47 minutes Emma was with professionals from when SWAST attended her home address until the time she was last seen prior to her death. Had it been accessed, and followed, there would have been opportunities to discuss with Emma further support for her whilst she was at the hospital and the evidence given by the witnesses who had contact with her that day was that they would have considered managing her care differently. vi. University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust, of which the Royal Bournemouth Hospital forms part, have taken action internally to ensure that a person's records are now available when a person arrives at the hospital and this would include access to Frequent Attender Care Plans, however evidence was given that a similar process around the merger of records is undertaken at other hospitals across the South West, from the experience of SWAST, and this may also be a national issue. vii. The Summary Care Record (SCR) is accessible to a variety of healthcare professionals and accessible to SWAST. 4 viii. As per the NHS England website, link found here Summary Care Record - NHS England Digital, “The Summary Care Record (SCR) is a national database that holds electronic records of important patient information such as current medication, allergies and details of any previous bad reactions to medicines, created from GP medical records. It can be seen and used by authorised staff in other areas of the health and care system involved in the patient's direct care”. ix. Documents cannot be uploaded to the SCR, however a section can be added to the SCR to detail information such as care plans. Evidence was given that the content of the SCR is controlled by the specific Integrated Care Boards (ICB) covering that area. There are 42 ICBs across England and Wales. x. The SCR for Dorset does not include a section to detail the care plans in place for individuals. The Deputy Director for Care for SWAST gave evidence that none of the ICBs in the South West Region has a section in the SCR to detail care plans in place for individuals. IF there were such a section, the GP of the individual would then be responsible for uploading the details to the SCR and then it would be accessible to other health professionals the person comes into contact with nationally. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. There can be a delay in accessing a patient's hospital record and history when they are taken to hospital by a paramedic depending on the method of booking in and triage which could impact on patient care, especially if there are delays in them being assessed such as when they are placed in cohorting areas, and this could lead to a future death. ii. The Summary Care Record does not detail care plans in place for individuals in Dorset, the wider South West region and may be nationally. Lack of access to these plans could impact on patient care and lead to a future death. 6"

I will reflect that in this report.

I conducted an inquest into the death of Jai which concluded on 21st of November 2024. I recorded a conclusion of suicide.","Jai was a 36 year old GP. She was found deceased on 27 th of April 2023. I have not detailed all of Jai's contact with mental health services in this report. Instead, I have focused on aspects of the chronology which are relevant to the concerns I am raising. Jai referred herself to the Crisis Response and Home Treatment Team (“the crisis team”) on 21 st of June 2022. She attended three appointments in June and July 2022, and was discharged from the crisis team to Buckinghamshire Talking Therapies (“BTT”) on 29 th of July 2022. Whilst under this team, Jai disclosed that she had made previous suicide attempts. From August 2022 onwards, the mental health support that Jai received was from teams other than BTT. These teams used a different electronic records system (called Rio). They are part of the same NHS trust, but it was not possible for clinicians to access both systems. After an attempt to refer Jai to the crisis team (by her GP) on 31 st of August 2022, Jai was provided with an appointment date with the community mental health team. The appointment date was 8 th of September 2022. Before that appointment could happen, Jai attended accident and emergency (after being encouraged to do so by friends and her GP). She was then admitted as a voluntary patient to a psychiatric ward, until 7 th of September 2022. After she was discharged, Jai was under the crisis team for around 10 days. After that, no medium or long term plan was put in place, and she was discharged back to the care of her GP. Jai took her own life in April 2023. She was not under secondary mental health services at the time of her death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The Trust's own internal investigation highlighted the fact that no care co- ordinator or key worker was provided to Jai after her discharge from hospital on 7th of September 2022. The Trust's initial plan was to review this by June 2024, and the aim now is for January 2025, almost two years from Jai's death. 2. It is still not possible for teams using RiO and the BTT systems to access each other's clinical notes. 6"

(2) NHS England. (3) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). 1,On 26 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nicolette Elizabeth McCARTHY aged 46. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Nicolette Elizabeth McCarthy died as a result of suicide due to her acute mental ill health and a series of contributory factors. There were a series of failures in the systems and procedures which should have guaranteed her safety.,"The jury made the following findings of fact in Box 3 of the Record of Inquest: Nicolette Elizabeth McCarthy was detained to the Woodlands secure unit – under the Mental Health Act – Section 5(2) for concerns of her own safety following attempts to take her life. On the 18th and 19th September there remained a risk that she may attempt to end her own life. On 18th September 2023, Nicolette's family attended the ward round discussion, there is no evidence that confirmation of escorted or unescorted leave was delivered to them. Any ambiguity could have been avoided if Trust procedures had been followed, written confirmation of the S17 decision provided and acknowledged by the family. It was appropriate to grant in principle unescorted S17 leave but not implement it until written confirmation was provided to the family and the risk assessment updated. Nicolette should not have been required to leave unit grounds. Although the NHS/Sussex Trust have a policy that no smoking should take place within the grounds, there should have been provisions that within secure units secure smoking facilities or indeed an exemption should have been made. As per the Trust's “Record of Patient leave” form, checks and consideration should have been given to the appropriateness of any items Nicolette had on her person for the leave being taken. As per the Trust's concession, the Trust did not take immediate action, aligned to Nicolette's individual clinical risk, when Nicolette did not return to the ward, following her 15 minutes leave (starting at 14:37) on 19 September 2023. The failure to mark Nicolette as AWOL rather than on leave added to the confusion and highlighted gaps in the record keeping. Although staffing levels were low and incidents on 19th September 2023 further impacted staff availability, there was a failure to take steps as outlined in Trust policies following identification of Nicolette's absence. There were further factors in play: 1) insufficient adherence to recording patient login time in the procedure on the S17 leave sheet. 2) unacceptable delays in taking appropriate action on 19th September. 3) the Trust's adherence to robust note keeping/updating appears to have been lax and retrospective at times. It is possible that on 19th September 2023, had staff taken prompt action there would have been opportunities by which Nicolette's death could have been avoided","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1) During the course of the inquest, I heard evidence from clinicians and staff at the Trust to the effect that the NHS England smoke free policy is placing mental health in patients at an increased risk from self-harm and suicide. 2) Although smoking cessation advice and treatment (e.g. gum, vapes etc.) are routinely offered to patients, the evidence was that many struggle to give up smoking on their admission to the ward, in part because the anxiety associated with stopping exacerbates their mental health symptoms. Staff also felt that forcing patients to stop smoking against their will (e.g. by prohibiting them from smoking while on leave) would have a negative effect on their sense of autonomy and wellbeing, which are important for recovery. 3) The Trust understand that they are bound by the Health Act 2006 and by NHS England policy not to permit or facilitate smoking on the ward or anywhere on the grounds of the hospital. This is taken seriously and is interpreted to mean that staff are prohibited from facilitating smoking, for example by granting leave for the purpose of smoking or by escorting patients to smoke outside on short periods of leave. Senior staff also believed that it would be contrary to NHS policy to permit smoking in a secure area, for example the enclosed ward garden. At the same time, it was acknowledged that patients would inevitably seek leave to smoke and that this could not be denied without a negative impact on their mental health. 4) The jury heard evidence that patients, like Mrs McCarthy, were routinely given 15- minute grounds leave for the purpose of smoking, a practice that is discouraged by the Trust. Clinical staff felt that the policy placed them in a difficult position, torn between the need to comply with the smoke free policy, while also supporting patient autonomy and keeping safe those patients who are at a higher risk of self- harm or suicide. 5) There is a further contradiction caused by the smoke free policy, in that patients are not permitted to smoke on the grounds, but are not supposed to leave the grounds during short periods of 'grounds' leave. The result is that patients would spend their 15-minute leave smoking by the side of the road on the edge of the ward grounds, which is a poorly supervised area, and staff would avoid asking them too closely where they were going and would avoid standing close to them, even Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 when smoking themselves. This contributed to the circumstances that allowed Mrs McCarthy to slip away unnoticed and ultimately to take her own life. 6) I also heard evidence from senior staff that the national policy guidance intended to address smoking and s17 leave (e.g. the NICE Guidance and CQC Guidance) does not adequately resolve these contradictions. 7) I am concerned that the NHS smoke free policy, while clearly motivated by a genuine and pressing concern to protect life and promote health, may not be adequately tailored to reflect the safety requirements of mental health wards or the reality that some mental health patients will inevitably seek short periods of leave to smoke. Action may need to be taken at the national policy level to provide clearer guidance and/or review the law to reduce the risk of patients in mental health wards absconding while on unescorted grounds leave. 6"

The toxicology report recorded a [REDACTED] blood level of [REDACTED] ug/ml and noted the fatal level was [REDACTED] ug/ml. The toxicology report went on to state that [REDACTED] was a short acting barbiturate used in the UK only as an anaesthetic agent in Veterinary Medicine .","From the evidence I received, at the inquest, there are matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – On completion of the inquest, I was concerned that Edward, a vulnerable young adult, managed to come into possession of , a substance which I understand from the Toxicology report, is only licensed for use on animals by qualified veterinary professionals. I infer from the Toxicology evidence and the fact that Edward was not a veterinary professional that he must have obtained the substance from an illicit source. I am concerned that if I do not make a report a potential emerging risk to life may slip past public attention unnoticed. I therefore make this report to the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, whom I understand is the organisation responsible for licensing , so that the Directorate is aware that the drug has been used for a suicidal purpose and to enable the organisation to examine any available preventive measures to reduce the risk of this suicide method occurring in future. I am also reporting this fatal incident to the Royal Society of Veterinary Surgeons to share the information with its members and to ensure that those to whom the drug is licensed are made fully aware of its potential to be used in the completion of suicide by humans. I also make the report to the Royal Society to take any available preventive measures to reduce the risk of this suicide method in future. 6"

I heard an inquest touching on Rick's death at Stockport Coroner's Court on the 14 th November 2024.","At the Inquest on the 14 th November 2024, I returned a conclusion of suicide. In respect of the circumstances of the death I found that on the 25 th January 2024, the deceased accessed the railway by the [REDACTED]. He intentionally stepped in the path of an approaching train and was struck, causing catastrophic and fatal injuries. In the days prior to his death, the deceased had been experiencing a crisis period in his mental health. He had been diagnosed with possible paranoid schizophrenia in 2011 and was taking anti-psychotic medication. In the days prior to his death he had been expressing paranoid thoughts to his family and was anxious and distressed. His deliberate actions combined with his expressions to his family prior to his death that he thought something would happen that day, led me to conclude that it is likely that he intended to end his own life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. During the inquest, I heard that Rick was a vulnerable adult. He had a diagnosis of possible paranoid schizophrenia and was taking anti- psychotic medication. Rick was receiving support from the DWP. I heard from from the DWP that he was in receipt of ESA and DLA until 2016 when his DLA was transferred to PIP. At this point, this should have triggered an additional payment the Severe Disability Payment on his ESA. This didn't happen and DWP accepted in evidence that this was an error. There was then a delay in rectifying that error. In November 2023 the missed SDP calculation was identified and steps were taken to rectify it. By November 2023 the DWP stated in evidence that they owed Rick over £37,000 in arrears. told the inquest that the DWP Guidance for Making Large Payments states that in the case of vulnerable individuals, which Rick had been identified as being, should be dealt with by the CEAST team. said that the process should have been that Rick was spoken to by an agent who would assess how best to make the repayment in light of any known vulnerabilities he had. However, there is no qualitative record of that conversations beyond a drop down menu on the Severe Disability Journey Management System and “Phone Call Made” being selected as “Yes”. There is no record of the content of that conversation. On the evidence, I found it is likely that a call did take place. However without the notes, it is not possible to evaluate what was said, how long the call took and what steps were put in place to ensure that Rick understood the information within the call. Without any notes of the call, it is also not possible to assess what Rick was asked about his state of mind, any vulnerabilities he was experiencing and his ability to safely manage the receipt of large payments of money. The first DWP large payment was made on the 8th December 2023 of £5,000, which was paid directly into Rick's bank account. Prior to this date, Rick had been receiving benefits to the amount of under £300 per week plus a monthly stipend of money from his family of around £300. This was therefore a significant increase in his income. 3 It was clear to me from the evidence from Rick's sister that he became paranoid about the source of that money, indicating to me that any call from the DWP wasn't understood fully, or that it fed into a period of delusional thinking. The text messages he sent to his sister in the days prior to his death indicate that he didn't know where the money was coming from. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. This was a large payment of money to a vulnerable adult who was then required to self-manage that money. In these situations, it is important that there are robust systems in place for ensuring that the requisite assessments and checks are made of an individual to ensure that large payments can be made in a way that does not increase any vulnerability. 2. I heard evidence from that the DWP systems that are currently in place are hybrid of electronic and clerical systems and that payments can be initiated without there being a full note on the system of the content of the call with the individual. 3. I am therefore concerned that there is no way that an agent, quality assessor or team leader can properly evaluate whether any agreement made between the DWP and an individual regarding repayment has fully considered all the relevant factors regarding their vulnerabilities before a large payment is made. 4. I am also concerned that the DWP currently has no ability to effectively audit its large payments caseload to ascertain whether the failure in record keeping evident in the present case has occurred in other cases. 6"

Her inquest was opened on 28 th September 2023. Evidence was heard between 30 th September and 4 th October 2024 and Findings and Conclusion were given on 7 th November 2024. I recorded a conclusion of Suicide. I found the medical cause of death to be: 1a. [REDACTED] 2. Autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Anxiety and Depression","On 14 th September 2023, Hannah Aitken died at her supported accommodation in Caterham, Surrey, from an overdose of a poisonous substance, namely [REDACTED], which she had obtained [REDACTED]. Miss Aitken confirmed with the company by email on 30 th August 2023 that she intended to use this for [REDACTED]. The substance was recorded as delivered on the afternoon of 14 th September. Miss Aitken was subsequently heard to call out to her support workers for help, stating she had taken an overdose. She would not provide details of the substance and had hidden the packaging. She became unresponsive and subsequently suffered cardiac arrest, from which she could not be resuscitated despite prompt attendance and efforts from South East Coast Ambulance. Miss Aitken had a long-standing mental health background of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, requiring extensive periods of inpatient admission, and was under the care of the Tandridge Community Mental Health Recovery Service, Surrey and Borders Partnership. Miss Aitken detailed an intention to end her life in a notebook, which was written some weeks prior to her death at around the time of ordering the substance. This was located on her bed after her death.","A lethal dose of sodium nitrite can be as small as 1g. Miss Aitken was able to purchase 1kg of sodium nitrite at 99% purity from Malaysia, which she received by FedEx delivery to her home address. The Court heard anecdotal evidence from three Emergency Medical Consultants and others witnesses that in their direct experience, the use of sodium nitrite for self-harm is increasing. However, none were aware of a central monitoring system which is able to record incidents of sodium nitrite poisoning. Sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate are reportable substances under the Poisons Act 1972. The only obligation under this legislation is that domestic sellers must report reasonable grounds for believing transactions are suspicious. There are no restrictions on the import of sodium nitrite or sodium nitrate from abroad. Since 2020, the Home Office has received at least five Prevention of Future Death Reports relating to sodium nitrite/sodium nitrate. The Home Secretary has recently provided reassurance in response to the Regulation 28 report relating to the death of Dr Jonathan Shaw that “the Home Office is actively exploring legislative and policy options, including working with or alongside officials of other Government Departments as appropriate, for the control of sodium nitrite (and other similar substances)”. The Home Office has clarified in evidence during this inquest that the policy objective of the Poisons Act 1972 is to control access to explosives 3 RT4563 precursors and poisons and to detect terrorist use of these substances to illicitly manufacture explosives or to cause harm to third parties. Prevention of suicide/self-harm is not a policy objective of the Home Office under this Act, and this falls under the remit of the Department for Health and Social Care. No evidence was provided that there is active consideration of controlling access to these substances to the general public, whether under the remit of the Home Office or any other Government department. Whilst these substances have legitimate uses, including meat preservation, there does not appear to have been consideration as to whether the purity can be diluted, or any other measures taken, to reduce the risk posed by the quantities in which these substances are currently sold, against the risk to life that they can pose. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: - Sodium nitrite/nitrate can be purchased domestically with no restrictions save a duty on sellers to report suspicious transactions; - Sodium nitrite/nitrate can be purchased from abroad and imported to Great Britain with no restrictions; - Sodium nitrite is sold at levels of purity (99%) and in quantities which represent significant risk to life (up to 1000 fatal doses for 1kg sale), whether by self-harm or terrorist use; - The quantities and purity in which sodium nitrite/nitrate are sold do not appear to be those required for their legitimate use, for example in meat preservation; - It does not appear there is any consideration of regulating/monitoring the use of sodium nitrite/nitrate outside the limited provisions of the Poisons Act 1972, and it is not clear which Government department would be responsible for this. Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Joel Phillip Colk died on 2 October 2023 at [REDACTED], Brighton having intentionally ingested at least 50 times more than the lowest fatal level of [REDACTED] with the intent of taking his own life.",Joel Colk called 999 at 21:46 on 2 October 2023 and spoke with South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust. Mr Colk reported that he had had ingested 50g of [REDACTED] and provided his mobile phone number and address. His call was triaged using the NHS Pathways system which resulted as a category 3 disposition for ambulance attendance. An ambulance attended him at 22:47 after the call was upgraded to category 2 at 22:28 as it had not been reviewed by a clinician in accordance with South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust policy that the call be reviewed within 40 minutes. On attendance Mr Colk was in cardiac arrest and sadly despite the best efforts of clinicians he died at his home address.,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The Court heard that when a call is made to 999 that the call is categorised using NHS Pathways and that all overdoses would be in the same classification resulting in the same disposition and response category. The system does not differentiate between types of, severity of or the drugs/chemicals reported as being the cause of the overdose. The system also does not differentiate call classification taking into account the amount reported as ingested, the timing of ingestion or the patient's weight. The Court heard that all of these factors can impact on the time in which care needs to be rendered to prevent death. The example given to the Court was that someone who had taken a relatively small paracetamol that would be unlikely to cause harm would, using Pathways, have the same resultant disposition as someone who had ingested a significant amount of a known lethal chemical. Secondly, the Court heard that in the case of ingestion that treatment is only effective if medications are administered before the patient suffers a cardiac arrest. This likely will occur incredibly rapidly and is a known effect of the chemical. The Pathways system does not reflect the time sensitive nature for an effective response when it is known that has been ingested and would not create a higher disposition requiring more urgent attendance than category 3. The Court was also told that clinicians do not carry on any Ambulances within South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust Methylene Blue which is the antidote to ingestion as this is not within national guidance. I heard that in some areas there are ongoing trials for some areas that this is on board vehicles within the HART (Hazardous Area Response Team). Therefore in this area the treatment is only available when a patient reaches an acute hospital with an A&E department and the evidence was that often patients enter cardiac arrest before this occurs. 6"

The Investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 31 st May 2024. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Ligature around the neck The Conclusion of the Inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion – Erin Louise Tillsley was described by her family as a bubbly, bright and loving young person who exuded warmth and charisma. A person whose company was uplifting and who had a desire to see the lives of those around her enhanced. Erin initially adjusted well to secondary schooling, however following the restrictions imposed during the COVID pandemic being lifted, she struggled with her attendance although an explanation why this was the case could not be established. Following a difficult period with a friend at the end of 2022, on the 31 st December 2022 Erin consumed some of her mother's prescribed medication which Erin described as an overdose. She attended hospital where she was assessed for her physical symptoms. These were not considered serious and she was discharged on the 1 st January 2023. Emergency Department staff at the West Suffolk Hospital did not consider a referral to psychiatric liaison services to be appropriate during the admission; however advice was given for a referral by Erin's GP to mental health services. This occurred on the 4 th January 2023 with a referral being received by the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust Wellbeing Hub. The referral was screened and triaged and sent to Child and Family and Young Peoples mental health team (CFYP) for further action. Erin was contacted by the CFYP team on the 3 rd May 2023 and arrangements were agreed for her to be referred to a counselling service. Safety netting advice was provided at this time. It has not been possible to establish whether such a referral was made to counselling services and at the time of Erin's death no further contact with mental health services had occurred. Following her return to school in January 2023, Erin's attendance suffered further and in April 2023 it was agreed that she would transfer to another school which it was hoped would improve her attendance levels. This was not the case and her attendance levels slipped further and she attended her new school for only 4 days between the end of the May half term break and her death on the 14 th July 2023. On the 13 th July 2023 Erin attended a meeting at her school with her father where arrangements were discussed to both improve her attendance and resolve a disagreement she had with another pupil in her tutor group. Although initially upset at the commencement of the meeting, Erin was observed to be smiling and cheerful when leaving the meeting. She had agreed to return to school the following day. During the evening of the 13 th July Erin was observed at home to be happy and preparing to attend school the next day. On 14 th July 2023 Erin was seen by her family during the early morning and showed no signs of being distressed or upset. During telephone calls with her father mid-morning, Erin stated that she would not be attending school and refused, despite attempts to persuade her otherwise by her father, to change her mind. Around 1030am her father became concerned that Erin had stopped responding to text messages or answering her phone and returned home to find Erin suspended by a ligature in her room. Emergency services attended and despite attempts at resuscitation Erin was pronounced deceased at the scene. Police enquiries revealed no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement in the death. Erin Louise TILLSLEY took her own life.",The circumstances of the death are recorded in the Narrative Conclusion.,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Evidence received at Inquest included NICE guideline [NG225]; 'Self-harm: Assessment, Management and Preventing Recurrence.' Published: 07 September 2022. This guidance states inter alia that: ""Following triage, patients who have self-harmed should receive the requisite treatment for their physical condition, undergo risk and full psychosocial needs assessment and mental state examination, and referral for further treatment and care as necessary” and “All people who have self-harmed should be offered an assessment of needs, which should be comprehensive and include evaluation of the social, psychological and motivational factors specific to the act of self-harm, current suicidal intent and hopelessness, as well as a full mental health and social needs assessment.” Evidence was also received in the form of a Joint Policy Document published by Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board (SNEE) and Suffolk County Council (SCC) (Version 21 – January 2023) titled 'Suffolk and North East Essex Health & Social Care Protocol for the Support of Children and Young People in Crisis.' This Policy document outlined the resources available in circumstances where Young People Present into an Emergency Department (ED) in Suffolk to facilitate NICE recommended urgent and emergency care, including NICE recommended treatment for self-harm. The available resources on a 24/7 basis for all age groups includes the Mental Health Liaison Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Service (MHLS) which offers specialist mental health care in a physical health setting by supporting the work of clinicians working in general health pathways, enabling EDs and wards in general hospitals to assess and support mental health needs as they present or arise among people being cared for in the general health pathway. Evidence received during the course of the Inquest indicated that neither the NICE Guidance nor the SNEE/SCC Policy were applied in relation to the care and treatment extended to Erin in the West Suffolk Hospital Emergency Department during her attendance over the period 31st December 2022 to 1st January 2023. The failure to apply this guidance/policy meant that there was a missed opportunity for mental health services to engage early with a vulnerable child who had presented to the Emergency Department having undertaken an act which she described as an overdose. 6"

On 6 November 2024 I concluded an Inquest into his death after a 2-day hearing.","Alexander took his own life when he jumped from [REDACTED], Oxford into the River Thames suffering a fatal head injury. In the preceding days, he had been ostracised, which included what was described as 'name calling', 'targeted behaviour' and exclusion and rejection following allegations made against him about his conduct. I reached a formal conclusion of Suicide.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. 2 In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make this report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are in relation to the following: Coroner's Concerns: In accordance with guidance to Universities, the College had commissioned an independent Serious Incident Review conducted by , a specialist in mental health, and that Review identified evidence of a concerning practice of social ostracism among students, often referred to as a 'cancel culture'. Her evidence was that this behaviour, where individuals are isolated and excluded from social groups based on allegations or perceptions of wrongdoing, poses a significant risk to student mental health and well-being. Both , and the Director of Student Welfare at Oxford University, , were of the view that this practice was likely in evidence in other higher education institutions although there was some uncertainty as to his prevalence. has made a number of recommendations specific to the to the College and University which they are implementing with some diligence. It was acknowledged this was complex and highly-sensitive issue in student life. Accordingly, I have attached a redacted extract from the 's Review which sets out the evidence-base for this culture and its potential effects and risk, together with her proposals as to how it may be addressed through awareness raising and education. I did not find on the balance of probabilities that this culture specifically caused or contributed to Alexander's death, but it did give rise to a concern that circumstances creating a risk of future deaths could occur. The specific matters of concern are: • Prevalence of social ostracism: Evidence suggests that social ostracism is a recognized practice within student communities, with multiple cases observed and acknowledged by both students and staff. The evidence was that this may be an issue more broadly for Universities in the UK. • Social ostracism as 'self-policing': Students appear to employ social ostracism as a means of 'self-policing' their community, often in response to allegations of serious misconduct. This occurs in the absence of formal processes and without proper investigation or evidence. 3 • Negative impact on mental health: Social ostracism can have severe and lasting negative impacts on mental health. It can lead to feelings of isolation, shame, guilt, and worthlessness, all of which are recognized risk factors for suicide. • Lack of trust in formal processes: The prevalence of social ostracism may be linked to a lack of trust in formal channels for reporting serious concerns. Students may perceive these processes as ineffective, unfair, or biased, leading them to seek alternative means of addressing perceived wrongdoing. • Normalization of exclusionary behaviour: There is concern that social ostracism has become normalized within student communities, with individuals viewing it as an expected and accepted response to certain allegations or behaviours. This normalization hinders the development of healthy and supportive social environments. 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was that: See Narrative Conclusion.,"Henry was as last seen by his parents on the 20th April 24, at 22:15 hours at his home address when he went to bed. He was described as being in good spirits. After his parents had gone to bed, it is believed Henry has left the address in his fathers mother vehicle and is stopped by the Police and the vehicle was seized by Police at 02:15 hours.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) On the 13th November 2023 Henry Joseph Grierson with the consent of his Parents discontinued his referral and treatment from the organisation CAMHS, and on the 9th April 2024, Mr Grierson gave notice if his intention to discharge himself from the support organisation Recovery Steps.

Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 No information concerning the current mental health issues of Mr Grierson had been provided to the College within a mitigation statement provided by him. The evidence before the Court is that the latest communication concerning Mr Grierson's mental health provided by CAMHS was dated October 2023. It is a matter of concern that communication between the college and CAMHS and Recovery Steps was not seemingly maintained to enable an awareness by the College of the current mental health of Mr Grierson in April 2024 and the decisions taken by himself and his family, to remove such external support. 6"
https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/darren-hope-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2024-0597,2024-11-04,Linda Lee,Coventry and Warwickshire, The Chief Executive Officer of the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust 1.,": On 14 July 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Darren Joseph Hope, who died on the 3July 2023 aged 53. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest before me and a jury on 24 October 2024. The conclusion of the Jury was: Medical cause of death: 1a Multiple Injuries Darren Joseph Hope died as a result of suicide. Some factors that contributed to this were him being allowed to leave after being assessed as low risk despite threats to himself and others, and him being unaccompanied despite having been assessed already that he should be accompanied.",": Darren Joseph Hope had a background of increasing mental health problems and prior involvement with the police. On 29 May 2023, he was taken to the Caludon Centre (the Centre) by the police and admitted under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. Due to an administrative error, he was initially treated as a voluntary patient for several days before being formally detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. He had a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. Darren was deemed suitable for unescorted Section 17 leave, against a history of absconding, using alcohol and cannabis while on unescorted leave, and expressing suicidal thoughts while on unescorted leave at home. It does not appear that the Responsible Clinician was given this information. Darren was granted six hours of unescorted leave. However, the Section 17 leave form signed by the Responsible Clinician indicated that he was to be accompanied by family members. The Responsible Clinician later reported this was an error, as he had intended to grant unescorted leave. The Responsible Clinician also stated that even if all of the events had been drawn to his attention, he would still have granted unescorted leave. On the morning of 3 July 2023, Darren appeared happy and optimistic about the future when he utilised his six-hour unescorted leave at approximately 11:15 am. He returned to his home address at around 2:15 pm. Darren lived in a 10th-floor flat. At approximately 3:20 pm, he was found at the base of the building and was pronounced dead. The cause of death was determined to be multiple injuries due to a fall from height. At the time of his leave, Darren did not have a mobile phone, as it had been retained by the police on his arrest, prior to admission to the Centre. He did not have a landline, and it appears he did not have means of accessing his bank accounts, and no cash was found on his person. The evidence suggests that Darren had no means of contacting the Centre or anyone else if he had concerns, nor could the Centre contact him during his leave. His inability to contact or be contacted was not considered when granting his leave or when signing him out of the ward on 3 July 2023. A subsequent investigation and Patient Safety Incident Investigation Report (the Report), dated 18 January 2024, did not “ identify a requirement for the implementation of any safety actions .” The Report noted that on 3 July 2023 Darren had been granted over the six hours permitted, as he left at 10:15 am [sic] and was not required to return until 6 pm. The Report also noted that on 3 June 2023, Section 17 leave would have been permitted even though there was no Section 17 leave form in place on that date. Leave did not take place due to misplaced keys. The Report did not note that the Section 17 leave form in place on 3 July 2023 only permitted unescorted leave. The Report did not note that Darren's method of communicating with the Centre had not been considered at any point. The inquest received evidence that the investigating officer was not required to inform the oversight team who sign off the Report—the Significant Incident Group (the SIG)—of any issues that had arisen during the investigation and subsequently disregarded. The evidence did not explain how the SIG was able to provide meaningful oversight on the basis of reviewing the draft report only. Although the inquest received evidence regarding proposed changes around Section 17 leave, this was not reflected in the evidence of staff members directly involved in patient care. The Report states that, “ The investigation team follow the Duty of Candour and the Engaging and Involving Patients, Families and Staff after a Patient Safety Guidance in their collaboration with those affected, to help them identify what happened and how this resulted in a patient safety incident .” The inquest received evidence that Darren's mother had been contacted once by telephone call and once by text message, but she and the wider family were not given the opportunity to participate or raise issues. They were not provided with any information about Darren's care or any other information which would have enabled them to participate in any significant way.",": During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report these concerns to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: o Concern 1: Section 17 leave conditions may not always be thoroughly reviewed or clarified before a service user is signed out for leave. This lack of verification can lead to unaddressed discrepancies, which may impact the safety and appropriateness of unescorted leave. o Concern 2: There may be a lack of accessible or reliable means for service users on unescorted leave to contact the facility if they encounter difficulties. This could impact their ability to seek support or assistance when needed. o o Concern 3: There may be limitations in the reporting system's ability to identify and address substantive issues that directly impact patient safety. If critical concerns are overlooked, there is a risk that valuable insights for preventing future incidents may be missed, reducing the system's effectiveness in promoting long-term safety improvements. 6."
https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/jamie-harding-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2024-0610,2024-10-29,Sean Horstead,Essex,1. CEO of Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust 1,"On 20 th June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jamie Harding, aged 31 years'. The investigation concluded at the end of a 5-day inquest on 12 h April 2024. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: I (a) Multiple severe Injuries I (b) Fall from Height II Psychotic Disorder The Deceased had been under the care of the Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) Essex Support and Treatment for Early Psychosis (ESTEP) between 2017 and 2020 and he had been prescribed anti-psychotic medication and allocated a Care Coordinator. The inquest heard evidence that Jamie had engaged relatively well with his care plan and was reporting improvements in his symptoms. However, he began to disengage with services in 2019, which appears to have coincided with the replacement of his Care Coordinator. He was discharged from EPUT services in November 2020. Jamie's GP continued to be prescribed anti-psychotic medication. Two separate and urgent GP referrals were made to EPUT in November 2021 requesting an urgent review of Jamie, as he was hearing voices, experiencing paranoia, and reporting that his medication was not working. His mother also contacted EPUT directly. On 18 January 2022, Jamie was assessed by EPUT's First Response Team (FRT) via telephone. Jamie described his symptoms, reported that he was binge drinking, and requested different medication. A plan was put in please for Jamie to self-refer to a drug an alcohol service, and for his case to be discussed in a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting ('MDT'). The evidence disclosed that in the six months that followed this assessment there were a series of significant and repeated failures on the part of EPUT employees, together with inadequacies in the systems of operation of EPUT's First Response Team, in the care, management and treatment provided to Jamie. My Narrative Conclusion recorded that the Deceased took his own life whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed and, further, recorded that a number of significant and repeated failures contributed to the avoidable death. The cumulative effect of these failures amounted to a gross failure to provide Jamie with basic medical care at a time that his condition clearly required it and, in this respect, neglect directly contributed to Jamie's death.","On the 3 rd of June 2022 Jamie, accompanied by his mother, presented at Basildon Hospital A&E Department in crisis and seeking help for his further deteriorating mental health on a background of some three days lack of sleep and ineffective anti-psychotic medication failing to ameliorate the on-going and extreme paranoia and psychotic symptoms he was experiencing. In the context of on-going suicidal ideation and a subjective mood score recorded as 0/10, he was appropriately referred to the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) for assessment by the A&E doctor. The assessment subsequently undertaken by the MHLT practitioner was inadequate and failed to appropriately act upon relevant information available to him including (but not limited to) information provided by Jamie's mother regarding her son's on-going suicidal ideation and her (and Jamie's) expressed request for him to be admitted to hospital as a voluntary in-patient as she, and Jamie, did not feel able to keep him safe. Although the MHLT clinician gave evidence that he had concluded that Jamie required and would benefit from a period of admission as an in-patient , no such admission was sought or planned. Instead, Jamie was discharged home with a plan for him to be seen the following day by the Home Treatment Team. He was provided with a (daily) tablet of Zopiclone for the next seven days. Within hours Jamie had taken his own life having fallen a significant height from a window at his home address. The failure by the MHLT practitioner to initiate the process for Jamie's admission to an in-patient bed constituted a clear missed opportunity to ensure appropriate and likely effective steps were taken to mitigate his high risk of acting upon his clear suicidal ideation. The cumulative effect of the series of serious failures in the six months preceding the events of the 3 rd of June amounted to a gross failure to provide Jamie with basic medical care at a time that his condition clearly required it. In this respect, neglect directly and more than minimally contributed to Jamie's death. The failures identified included: a serious failure to adequately follow up a plan identified in an assessment undertaken on the 18 th January 2022 by a First Response Team (FRT) Assessor and a Trainee Doctor. The lack of any adequate follow up led directly to a failure to conduct a full Multi-Disciplinary Team Meeting (MDT) in respect of Jamie's complex, on-going presentation involving increasing paranoia and psychotic-like symptomology in conjunction with on-going alcohol misuse; a failure to undertake an urgent medication review over the same six-month period despite repeated requests for the same from GPs, Jamie himself and his mother; the failure to hold a full MDT was a significant missed opportunity to allocate a Care Coordinator to Jamie and a missed opportunity to involve the Dual Diagnosis Service in Jamie's care; absent a full MDT and the allocation of a Care Coordinator, there was a serious missed opportunity to develop an appropriate Care Plan for Jamie and undertake regular, up-dated risk assessments regarding self-harm and suicide; On the 20 th May an EPUT Consultant Psychiatrist declined to undertake a review of Jamie's medication, or any further form of review as requested by Jamie's GP: this too was a serious missed opportunity.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (a) The accepted absence of effective formal, compulsory training for clinicians regarding the Dual Diagnosis (DD) pathway and what it does and does not provide, how to access it and the potential benefits of it. The evidence confirmed that practitioners outside of the DD 4 workers/pathway were unaware how they could contact them, including directly. (b) In addition to weak record keeping and poor communication with patients and their families, the evidence revealed the lack of a robust and reliable system to ensure that the FRT deals with its caseload efficiently and effectively and particularly how it flags and then follows up referrals to and queries from other services/clinicians contributing, in turn and on the facts of this case, to the significant failure to hold an MDT. The FRT did not follow up (as it was accepted it should have) the referral (via a self-referral) to Open Road or the referrals for a medication review. Had there been such follow up, EPUT evidence confirmed that there would likely have been a discussion of Jamie's case at a full MDT with the likely allocation of a Care Coordinator, the likely involvement of the Dual Diagnosis pathway and the likely use of the RAG rating system to ensure on-going risk assessment. In my opinion these features give rise to a clear risk of future deaths and must be addressed. 6"

The medical cause of death was: 1a) Drowning 1b) 1c) 2) Ischemic Heart Disease, Cardiomegaly, Liver Fibrosis The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide while suffering from extreme distress",Mr Taylor was referred to Adult Social Services and Mental Health Team in December 2023. He was low in mood following the death of his wife. From February 2024 Mr Taylor's mood worsened and he remained under the care of the Mental Health Team. He was not taking his medication and had psychotic episodes and following assessment it was agreed consideration should be given to his being admitted to a mental health hospital. Mr Taylor expressed thoughts of self harm and suicidal intent. It was deemed appropriate not to carry out a formal Mental Act Assessment until a bed was available due to his paranoid presentation around professionals and concern his risk of self harm would increase. There was an urgent request for a bed to be found in a mental health hospital. On 3 March 2024 Mr Taylor drove to Gorleston [REDACTED]. He probably entered the sea at some time between 22.21 and 8 minutes after midnight on 4 March 2024. Mr Taylor was found on the shoreline at Gorleston beach on 4 March 2024. Mr Taylor died from drowning. A bed in a mental health hospital had not been found prior to Mr Taylor's death.,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. Evidence was heard from NSFT as to action they have taken in an attempt to increase the number of beds available and so prevent future deaths, such as daily meetings of senior staff to discuss caseloads identified at high risk, prioritising those at high risk, weekly meetings with Directors and multi agencies to consider patient flow through the system and discussion with partner organisations to remove barriers to discharge to improve patient flow especially those with social care requirements. Despite these steps there remain insufficient beds available to meet patient need. At the time of Mr Taylor's death there were 13 patients awaiting beds. At the time of inquest, there were 7 patients awaiting beds. There are peaks and lows with these numbers on a daily basis but overall there remains a shortage of beds. 2. Evidence was heard this is a national problem and not limited to Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Trust. 6"

Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), PO Box 473, Sale, M33 0BW 1","On 29/08/2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Martin Ian Stubbs, aged 50. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 24/10/2024. The conclusion of the Inquest was that Mr Stubbs' death was a suicide by hanging. He had hanged himself at his home address on 26/08/2024 and left notes to his family indicative of an intention to end his life. The medical cause of death was 1a) Hanging.","Mr Stubbs was a serving Police Officer. On 29/11/2022, nine days after receiving a long service and good conduct award at a formal ceremony in Wakefield, he was arrested by officers from West Yorkshire Police Professional Standards Department and bailed. He was suspended from duty. He remained suspended and on bail until his death. He had sought medical advice and assistance because of the mental strain of being suspended for so long, and a note recovered from the scene stated his belief that West Yorkshire Police had contributed to his death.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Mr Stubbs' father (a former officer himself and still a civilian police employee) expressed his firm belief that the length of time he had been suspended from duty had played a significant part in his son's decision to take his life. It is a concern that someone subject to an internal disciplinary process has a legitimate expectation that that process will be dealt with expeditiously in the interests of all parties, and that that legitimate expectation was not met in Mr Stubbs' case. Mr Stubbs' family do not understand whether the delay in concluding the process reflects resource issues or an institutionalised practice of allowing such matters to drift without proactive management to bring them to a conclusion. Anecdotally, Mr Stubbs' family are aware of other long outstanding internal disciplinary proceedings and fear other families may have to go through an experience similar to theirs. 6"

The Inquest was heard on 9 th October 2024 and concluded on 11 th October 2024. The conclusion of the Inquest was 'John Paul Hurst had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia with a long history of mental health difficulties and was the main carer for his father. Having initially been arrested in connection with the death of his father and subsequently de-arrested and then re-arrested on suspicion of an offence of possession of a controlled substance he was released from custody under investigation and then died [REDACTED] on 15th September 2021 from the effects of bleeding from trauma consistent with the amputation of the lower half of his right leg which is consistent with impact with a passing train in circumstances which cannot be explained.' The medical cause of death was: – Ia Right Lower Limb Injury","John Paul Hurst had a medical history of a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He had previously attempted to take his own life on three occasions between 2000 and 2002, and had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act during the same period. John lived with his father and was his main carer. His father sadly passed away on 12 th September 2021. Due to concerns around the length of time before John had sought assistance from emergency services, his demeanour upon police arrival and notes containing disturbing content within the premises, John was initially arrested on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter. He was quickly de-arrested for that offence and re-arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance. Concerns were raised by police officers involved in the investigation about his mental health due to John's demeanour, the volume and content of the notes found at the scene and detailed concerns expressed by his sister regarding a risk of him ending his own life upon release. John was assessed by Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service (CJLD) and deemed fit for interview and release from custody. Following his interview, John was released from custody at around 4pm on 13 th September 2021. He last spoke to his sister at around 9.44pm on 13 th September 2021. On the afternoon of 15 th September 2021, John was found by a passer-by in undergrowth near to the train tracks [REDACTED]. John died due to the effects of haemorrhage from the tearing and loss of the lower half of his right leg consistent with impact with a train moving at high speed.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is: – At the Inquest I heard evidence that, following John's arrest, concerns were expressed by police officers involved in the investigation as to his mental health, and by John's sister as to his risk of ending his own life. These concerns were repeated by John's sister to the Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service (CJLD) prior to his assessment. The evidence was that when completing the release risk assessment, the custody sergeant had been greatly assisted by the information recorded on the electronic custody record regarding the concerns that led to the mental health assessment and the assessment itself, in addition to the custody sergeant's own observations. The evidence highlighted that the electronic custody record contained limited information about the concerns of police officers and John's sister, and there was a distinct lack of detail about the assessment itself and very little analysis of the concerns and reasoning for the CJLD conclusion. I am concerned that the information on the electronic custody record was inadequate and lacked detail regarding the concerns for the detained person's mental health, as identified by police officers and family, including the risk of suicide, the content of notes found and the detained persons history of suicidal ideation and previous engagement with mental health services. In addition, I am concerned that the record also lacked a detailed analysis of those concerns by CJLD and comprehensive reasoning for the assessment conclusion. Deaths may be prevented if the recording of information in such cases is reviewed. Page 3 of 3 6"

The medical cause of death was 1a) Exsanguination 1b) Transection of the right internal jugular vein 1c) Puncture wounds to the neck,"Leslie Andrew Swindells had a complex mental health background. He was prescribed olanzapine and venlafaxine for his mental health and had been stable within the community. In May 2024 he started to display symptoms consistent with his mental health deteriorating including symptoms of paranoia. His family contacted the GP practice on 21st May 2024 with their concerns. An appointment was made for 2 days later with a mental health assistant practitioner. He should have been offered a same day appointment or referred to the Emergency Department. On 23rd May 2024 he spoke to a mental health assistant practitioner who was not qualified to assess him or his needs. They lacked the expertise to deal with him. A referral was to be made to secondary care. It was not made. His deteriorating condition and the increased risk he presented was not recognised due to the lack of experience of the practitioner and steps to mitigate the risk were not taken. He was not given any safety netting advice, was not escalated to a GP to be seen that day, his suicidal ideation was not explored. He was told he would be contacted following a referral. His mental health continued to deteriorate and on 29th May 2021 he was found unresponsive at his home address [REDACTED] from self-inflicted puncture wounds to the neck.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest heard evidence that the practitioner who saw Mr Swindells had very limited training in mental health and was employed in a role described as a mental health assistant practitioner. The evidence was that there was limited understanding of the scope of their role by GPs and what was covered by the term routine mental health appointments. 2. In Mr Swindells case the evidence was that he should never have had a review undertaken by someone with such a limited an understanding of mental health and that lack of understanding of mental health meant that the practitioner did not recognise the level of risk Mr Swindells posed. 3. The appointment had been booked via the reception team with no triage by a doctor following a telephone call to the practice. The evidence was that a shortage of trained reception/admin staff meant that an agency worker was screening calls that day and had a limited understanding of how patients needed to be allocated. 4. The evidence was that where GP practices chose to deploy staff with such limited qualifications to see those who needed treatment for their mental health it was essential that all those in the practice understood the limitations of the role and that there was close supervision of the practitioner. 5. The inquest heard that it was envisaged by the practice that the GP on duty would have a supervisory role. However it was unclear how this operated other than by the mental health assistant escalating a concern to the duty GP. 6. The assessment was carried out by telephone. The inquest was told that approximately 80% of the practitioner's mental health reviews took place in this way although it was accepted in evidence that it was far more challenging to assess an individual's mental health via telephone than face to face. During the conversation the practitioner did not identify their role or their qualifications to Mr Swindells. 7. The documentation of the practitioner was poor and did not reflect 3 the content of the conversation which had been recorded and was available to the inquest. 8. Practitioners such as the one who saw Mr Swindells are not part of a professional /supervisory body. 6

The inquest concluded on the 1 st May 2024 when I found that the medical cause of death was: Ia Suspension and my conclusion as to the death was that: Jennifer Chalkley died as a result of Suicide. Her death was more than minimally contributed to by : (i) A failure by Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service properly to assess, diagnose and treat Jennifer following referrals made in May 2018 and January 2021 in order to manage her conditions and minimise her risk of suicide, (ii) A failure by Surrey County Council's Special Educational Needs Department to ensure that Jennifer's Education, Health and Care Plan contained sufficient and updated information about her mental and emotional health needs and her risk of suicide, such as to enable the college she attended from September 2021 to understand and meet her consequential needs and manage the consequential risk, and (iii) A multi-agency failure to share information and work together to ensure that Jennifer was supported effectively to manage her neurodevelopmental and mental and emotional health needs, and her risk of suicide, especially from June 2021 onwards. I subsequently held a hearing to receive evidence relating to the prevention of future deaths and this was concluded on the 26 th July 2024. I then allowed time for submissions by Interested Persons.","When she died, aged 17 years, Jennifer Chalkley was a girl with complex special needs. She had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder when she was 10 years of age and Autistic Spectrum Disorder when she was aged 11 years. These two neurodevelopmental conditions, together with associated excessive anxiety, low mood, and emotional dysregulation from which she suffered periodically, resulted in a persisting but fluctuating risk of suicide. Jennifer was known to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service and to Children's Services, having been the subject of a number of referrals arising from her suicidal ideation and behaviour and her other vulnerabilities. She was also monitored under the Paediatric Team at a local hospital. An Education, Health and Care Plan was issued to Jennifer by the Special Educational Needs Department of her local authority when she was 15 years old, but she struggled to cope in mainstream school and experienced the breakdown of school and college placements. Jennifer also struggled to cope with personal relationships. In September 2021, Jennifer enrolled in a course at a new college. Within weeks she experienced low mood and was expressing suicidal ideation. Late on the evening of the 11 th October 2021, Jennifer returned to her mother's home, having separated from the boyfriend with whom she had been living. On the 12 th October 2021, Jennifer's mother feared that she was suffering a mental health crisis and arranged an emergency telephone consultation with the General Practitioner for later that day. However, at 16.20 hours, Jennifer was found hanging [REDACTED] in her bedroom. Despite resuscitation efforts from attending paramedics, she could not be revived and her death was pronounced at 16.40 hours on the 12 th October 2021. Full details of the events and failings which lead to Jennifer Chalkley's death are set out in my “Findings and Conclusions” document, a copy of which is sent with this report.","The evidence received at the prevention of future deaths hearing showed that a number of the issues and concerns raised at and following the inquest hearing have been addressed. However, in my opinion the following concerns remain and give rise to a continuing risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Concern 1 The “Special Educational Needs and Disability Code of Practice: 0 to 25 years”, which was issued by the Department for Education and the Department of Health and Social Care, provides statutory guidance for organisations which work with and support children and young people who have special educational needs or disabilities. The Code indicates that Local Authorities must carry out their functions with a view to identifying all the children and young people in their area who have or may have SEN or who have or may have a disability (Section 22 of the Children and Families Act 2014). At the inquest hearing, I heard that such children and young people must be identified as soon as possible so that their needs can be assessed and met as soon as possible. This is because the early provision of support increases its effectiveness and the meeting of need at the earliest stage may prevent, and is likely to reduce the risk of, mental health difficulties and suicidality developing. The evidence at the inquest revealed that there was some delay in an application being made for Jennifer to be assessed for an Education, Health and Care Plan because the mainstream school she attended believed that, before making such application, it must first have spent an additional £6,000 per annum in meeting her needs. The evidence suggested that this belief was wide-spread amongst schools, colleges and others, both in and beyond Surrey. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, it was confirmed that there is no statutory or other requirement for a school to have to spend an additional £6,000 per annum in meeting a child's SEN needs before applying for a statutory assessment. I am concerned that the misunderstanding by schools and colleges is delaying or preventing applications for statutory assessments being made in some cases and thereby acting as a barrier to ensuring all children and young people with additional needs are receiving effective support as soon as possible. I am concerned that this creates or increases the risk of avoidable suicidality developing. I heard that, in response to this misconception, Surrey County Council has, since Jennifer's death, updated its guidance on the criteria that will be considered to determine when a statutory assessment will be conducted and that the new guidance seeks to make it clear that there is no requirement for £6,000 to be spent before an application for assessment can be made. However, the evidence I 4 received from a local college showed that the misunderstanding persists, despite the updated guidance. It seems therefore that further action is needed to ensure that all Surrey schools and colleges understand, clearly, that spending an additional £6,000 on a child is not a pre-requisite to applying for a statutory assessment. I heard too that this misunderstanding probably originates from the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2023 (and their previous iterations), which set the high needs costs threshold at £6,000; it seems that the confusion may also stem from information issued by the Education and Skills Funding Agency. I am concerned that the misconception persists nationally and that, for the reasons set out above, action is needed to ensure that all schools and colleges understand, clearly, that spending an additional £6,000 on a child is not a pre-requisite to applying for a statutory assessment. Concern 2 At the inquest hearing the evidence showed that in September 2021, shortly before her death, Jennifer commenced a course at a new college. I heard that the new college did not receive her safeguarding file from her previous educational establishment prior to her death on the 12th October 2021; as a result the new college's ability to recognise and manage Jennifer's needs and risks, including her risk of suicide, was undermined. I heard that the Keeping Children Safe in Education 2024 statutory guidance for schools and colleges, and its previous iterations, state that where children leave a school or college, the designated safeguarding lead should ensure that their child protection file is transferred to the new school or college as soon as possible, and within 5 days for an in-year transfer, or otherwise within the first 5 days of the start of a new term, to allow the new school or college to have support in place for when the child arrives. I am concerned that the requirement to transfer safeguarding information “within the first 5 days of the start of a new term” means that a child who is at risk of self- harm or suicide may start at a new school or college without that establishment having all or any of the information in the safeguarding file. As that information is likely to be relevant to their management of the risk, I am concerned that permitting transfer up to five days after the start of term undermines the stated intention that the new school or college should “have support in place for when the child arrives”. I also heard that there is no centralised system that stores and transfers learning support and safeguarding information between schools and colleges, or other agencies who are supporting young people. Rather, the transfer of documents is undertaken by the individual schools and colleges concerned, with, I heard, variable levels of efficiency and reliability. 5 In the circumstances, I am concerned that there is not a national system in place to require and facilitate the guaranteed transfer of safeguarding information in advance of a child or young person starting a new school or college at the start of a new term or academic year, and that this exposes a suicidal child or young person to additional and avoidable risk. 6"

(1) The Neighbourhood Mental Health Team should ensure that their procedures are sufficiently robust regarding the sifting of clients for consideration by Mind.

(2) The procedure for the return of patients from Mind to the care of the Neighbourhood Mental Health Team should be transparent and encouraged if the Mind worker feels that is appropriate.

(3) If so requested by the Mind worker the patient should be returned to the care of the Neighbourhood Mental Health Team and the involvement of the Mind worker discontinued."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 October 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Paul Anthony Chase, also known as Paul Anthony Malone, died by Suicide. Paul had a medical history of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and drug abuse (cocaine). On the morning of 13 March 2024 Paul was found deceased hanging in Woolton Woods off School Lane, Liverpool, using [REDACTED]. The toxicological analysis revealed the presence of low levels of alcohol and cocaine. The post mortem examination found the medical cause of death to be: 1a Hanging During the inquest evidence was heard how the specialist mental health services for veterans was limited and there was a lack of funding for the services, with some veterans who were desperate for help having to wait 18 months. Evidence was also heard about there being little mental health support to those currently serving in the armed forces which is essentially when the PTSD starts to develop and limited mental health/alcoholism/addiction support for those having left the armed forces.","Paul Anthony Chase, also known as Paul Anthony Malone, was a 41 year old gentleman who had a medical history of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and drug abuse (cocaine). On the morning of 13 March 2024 Paul was found deceased hanging in Woolton Woods off School Lane, Liverpool, using [REDACTED]. The toxicological analysis revealed the presence of low levels of alcohol and cocaine. The post mortem examination found the cause of death to be hanging. Paul had been thought to be suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder since leaving the armed forces in 2009 but had not sought medical help until 2020. Over the last three years his mental health had deteriorated. In 2020 the social stresses he experienced resulted in his cocaine use to escalate. In December 2022 he attempted to ligature himself. Paul attended the Royal Liverpool University Hospital accident and emergency department on 22 November 2023 after recent contact with his GP and Mersey Care Crisis line due to suicidal ideations. He was then a voluntary patient at Windsor House Mental Health unit from 24 November 2023-15 December 2023. On 15 December 2023, Paul was discharged from Windsor House and placed in Tom Harrison House, a specialist addiction recovery service for armed forces veterans. This was a 12-week residential programme. On 1 January 2024 Paul tested positive for cocaine and as the Tom Harrison House had a zero tolerance to drugs and alcohol policy (clearly communicated to the residents so Paul would have been aware of this) Paul was asked to leave Tom Harrison House. Paul was given overnight accommodation on 1 January 2024 and then a 6 month support and accommodation package for him at The Block, County Rd, Walton, a veteran charity for rehabilitation for men in crisis. Paul then chose to go back home and there was no further contact. The care and treatment afforded to Paul through Mersey care and Tom Harrison House was reasonable and appropriate. It is more likely than not Paul did have PTSD on leaving the armed forces and it had remained dormant until the social stresses of life triggered the greater symptoms of PTSD. It is more likely than not Paul carried out the act of self-harm with the intention of taking his own life.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The inquest concluded on the 31 st May 2024 when I found that the medical cause of death was: Ia Multiple Injuries and my conclusion as to the death was that: Locket Ure Williams died as a result of Suicide. Their death was more than minimally contributed to by Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service's: (i) delay in assessing Locket's condition and needs, (ii) underestimation of Locket's risk of suicide, and (iii) failure to deliver necessary therapeutic treatment to Locket in a timely manner. I subsequently held a hearing to receive evidence relating to the prevention of future deaths and this was concluded on the 26 th September 2024.","Locket Williams was 15 years of age when they died. They had a history of self- harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. This history included a referral to Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service, with a report of self-harm and suicidal ideation, in October 2020, and three subsequent suicide attempts, in February, June and July 2021. Locket was suffering a Depressive Disorder and Emotional Dysregulation and, in April 2021, they were placed on the waiting list for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, which was expected to be effective in treating their conditions and controlling their suicidal ideation. Although Locket was prescribed medication and received some monitoring and support from the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service, the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy did not commence until very shortly before their death, and no effective treatment had been provided prior to their death.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows : Concern 1 The evidence at the inquest hearing revealed that, at the time of Locket's death, there were no psychiatric in-patient beds available for children in Surrey. It was recognised in the evidence that sending children out of the County, and sometimes to hospitals at a great distance away from their home, may be detrimental to their overall welfare, including their suicide risk, and may militate against their admission at all. 3 At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that a new, 12-bedded, unit named Emerald Place has since been opened by the Trust in partnership with a private provider. However, a concern about the level of in-county psychiatric in- patient beds for children continues because (i) the unit is not fully open and there is no fixed date for such opening, (ii) even when fully opened, it seems that the unit's 12 beds will be insufficient to meet the probable need at any one time, and (iii) even when fully opened, the unit will not be able to treat children with eating disorders or children needing psychiatric intensive care. Concern 2 On the basis of the evidence I heard at the inquest hearing, I found that Locket's death was contributed to by the Trust's underestimation of their risk of suicide. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that the Trust has introduced a new risk assessment system. The new system is in accordance with NICE guidelines and relies on a fuller description of the nature and level of the risk rather than its classification as low, medium, or high. It is clear from the evidence that there is good reason to move away from the three-tier classification, but I am concerned that the new system does not include any clear and obvious alert, on the medical records, that there is a risk of suicide in relation to the child in question. Although the intention of the new system is to encourage each clinician to read the narrative of the fuller risk assessment, there is currently a risk that, if they do not do so (and it is foreseeable that they will not always do so or be able to do so), they will be unaware of the risk of suicide. It was accepted in the evidence that an alert for a risk of suicide could be included in a child's record without undermining the move away from the three-tier classification of that risk as low, medium or high. Concern 3 I also heard that a child at risk of suicide may now be provided with a document, called “My Safety Plan”, one purpose of which is to help the child to communicate with others (including for example family members, teachers, and social workers) about their condition and risk. I was told that, if a child does not want to refer in the document to the risk of suicide, other terms such as “distress” may be used. To the extent that part of the purpose of the My Safety Plan is to enable the child to communicate their risk of suicide and thereby receive help to stay safe, I am 4 concerned that by substituting the word “distress” for “suicide”, some plans may not refer to suicide and may not therefore ensure that the nature of the risk is clearly conveyed to those from whom the child may seek support, and to the responsible adults in their life. Concern 4 From the evidence I heard at the inquest hearing, it was apparent that staff within CAMHS did not always attend or engage with Core Group Meetings to which they were invited by children's services. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, it was accepted that, for those children under Children's Services, active involvement in Core Group Meetings by all agencies involved with the child was of real importance. This was so, because the meetings were the means by which information was shared by different agencies and an informed plan was made to protect the child's life (including from suicide) and welfare. Failure by Trust staff to attend or otherwise to engage with the meetings, and the other agencies involved with the child, may therefore raise the risk to the child and undermine their protection. I was also told that there is an expectation that Trust staff should prioritise attendance / involvement in Core Group Meetings but, it seems, that no monitoring takes place to assess compliance with that expectation, including no systematic recording of the receipt of invitations to attend Core Group Meetings and no systematic recording of the response by the staff who have been invited, or otherwise. 6"

YES","In answer to the questions “when, where and how did Oliver come by his death?”, the jury recorded as follows: “Oliver Davies committed suicide in his cell at HMP Hewell by hanging. He died on the 31.12.22.”","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1) Oliver had been at HMP Hewell since 20.10.22. He was a man with long- standing mental health issues, for whom this was a first experience of custody. After a steady deterioration in his mental state, a mental health referral on 17.11.22 led to a belated mental health examination conducted by a registered learning disability nurse on 6.12.22. In the week leading up to the nurse's assessment: (a) A prison officer had made an urgent TAG mental health referral on 30.11.22, citing concerns that Oliver was experiencing active thoughts of self-harm or suicide, and that he ( the officer ) had “mild concerns” about intentional self-harm, and there were “definite indicators” of unintentional self-harm; and (b) Oliver himself had submitted a healthcare application form asking to see a doctor, saying that he was “extremely depressed”, his anxiety was “really high” and he was “not coping at all, please help”; These important events were not highlighted on Oliver's SystmOne medical record, and so the nurse conducting the assessment 6.12.22 was not aware of either of these important recent events, and did not take them into account when assessing Oliver; 2) Oliver was allocated a care coordinator on 6.12.12 following the nurse's assessment. An appointment was fixed for Oliver to meet the care coordinator for the first time on 14.12.22. Due to workload pressures, the care coordinator was unable to fulfil that appointment before he went on leave from 16- 28.12.22. Shortly before he went on leave, the care coordinator conducted a “RAG rating” exercise to determine whether he should prioritise seeing Oliver, and determined that Oliver's case merited the lowest priority RAG rating ( green ). When conducting that RAG rating exercise, the care coordinator did not take into account: (a) The prison officer's urgent TAG mental health referral of 30.11.22 ( above ); and (b) A further TAG mental health referral made by a prison paramedic which cited “mild concerns” about both deliberate and unintentional self-harm on Oliver's part, the details of which had been entered onto Oliver's SystmOne medical record. In addition, the care coordinator did not raise in the mental health team's daily forum.the fact that he was unlikely to have time to see Oliver before he went on leave. Had the care coordinator taken into account the referrals at (a)-(b) above, and raised at the daily forum his difficulty in being able to see Oliver, it may well have been that Oliver's case would have merited a more urgent response from the care coordinator or someone else in his stead. 4 Having heard evidence at the inquest from your Trust's Clinical Director, , I was not satisfied that the Trust has fully recognized the above shortcomings, and taken action to ensure that they are not repeated for other mental health patients in custody at HMP Hewell. 6"

An ambulance was called, and Nigel was initially taken to the Ipswich Hospital but was transferred to the trauma centre at Addenbrooke's hospital due to the extent of his injuries. Nigel succumbed to the injuries received in the fall, three days later. Nigel had suffered with his mental health for a protracted period, and it is more likely than not that his fall from the window was a deliberate attempt to end his life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows. – 1. In late 2018 Nigel became seriously mentally unwell and was admitted to a Mental Health Unit, under the Mental Health Act provisions, for a period of 3 months. Whilst admitted, Nigel was diagnosed with advanced lymphoma (a lymphatic cancer) and upon discharge from the Mental Health Unit spent a further 3 months in hospital being treated for this. 2. Nigel found his Mental Health Unit admission very traumatic and was described as 'terrified' of the thought of ever being admitted again. 3. Upon his release, his family, carers, Mental Health Home Treatment team, worked together to provide exemplary care for Nigel, whose health stabilised and in 2020 his care was transferred back to his own General Practitioner. 4. Nigel remained well until Friday 8th March 2024, when due to his decline in mental health he was taken to see his GP, and on the 9th March 2024 Nigel was prevented by family intervention from ending his life by . 5. This incident led to Nigel's family speaking to the on duty Authorised Mental Health Professional (AMHP) from the Suffolk Emergency Duty Service Team, on the evening of 9th March 2024. An AMHP is a mental health professional approved by a local social services authority to coordinate the mental health assessment and admission to hospital, of individuals requiring admission under the Mental Health Act provisions 6. In evidence, the court heard that the AMHP, in line with Nigel's family and his own wishes, agreed that an admission to hospital would not be in Nigel's best interest. The AMHP identified that the successful home treatment regime previously in place would be the ideal care package for Nigel. This arrangement would also be consistent with the 'least restrictive principle' which surrounds the application of Mental Health legislation. 7. That said, although Nigel did not meet the criteria for immediate admission, the AMHP believed Nigel was mentally very unwell, and in need of immediate support. The court heard that such support would be available within a 4-hour target time, from the emergency Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team. 8. However, the court was told that an AMHP, despite their role in the coordination of the mental health assessment and admission to hospital of a patient, were not permitted to make direct referrals to the emergency Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team. 9. The court heard that the normal route for such referrals was via the GP Surgery, or primary care Mental Health Nurse, neither of whom in Nigel's case would have been available before 08:00 on Monday 11th March 2024. Nigel's fall which led to his death, occurred at 06:25 that morning. 10. I am concerned, as had the AHMP in Nigel's case been able to directly refer him to the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team on the 9th March 2024, mental health professionals would have attended, and been able to provide additional support, advice and potentially additional treatment for Nigel, in all likelihood preventing his death. 6"

He had been suffering with mental health issues for several years. Having considered the evidence, on the balance of probabilities we have identified the following contributing factors – 1) The decision to close the police log on the 25th August 2023 and the police not attending Michael resulted in a missed opportunity for a welfare check, 2) Poor inter agency communication and failures to follow up any outstanding action points, in particular the failure of the Trafford North West Mental Health team to chase up the date when Michael was due to return from Gibraltar and investigate the blank email with Michael's identifier. In addition, the failure of Trafford Council Adult Social Care to verify that police were attending on the 25th August 2023. 3) The failure of mental health services in Gibraltar to notify Trafford Mental Health Team of the exact date of Michael's return to the United Kingdom. This resulted in a lack of mental health support when he returned. 4) The lack of probing by North West Ambulance Service mental health practitioner during telephone triage on 23rd August 2023 resulted in a missed opportunity for a face to face assessment. 5) Michael's mental health condition and his reluctance to take his psychiatric medication consistently and his reluctance to engage with mental health services or General practitioner.","The evidence heard during the inquest into Michael Sean Heath's death and the findings of the jury confirmed there were a number of factors contributing to Michael's death which are of concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows - In relation to Policing is the extent to which all officers are trained to assess the increasing number of calls to the police which are of a mental health nature, the risks associated with the consequences of not making the right assessment where there may be an immediate risk to life and when to accept that the police are the right agency to be involved in mantal health related enquiries due to their powers of entry; In relation to the management of mental health patients that their carers are made aware of any admission under the Mental Health Act within 24 hours and those patients are supported with access to an independent mental health advocate; The apparent lack of connectivity between mental health services abroad and the UK upon repatriation whilst the patient remains ill; That there is a risk to patients generated by a decision to remove a patient from a GP practice list where the patient resides out of geographical area for that GP practice without considering the wider circumstances and the likely follow on care; and The means of communication is known and agreed between all mental health agencies to ensure all relevant patient information is held in an accessible central repository. 6"

The inquest was concluded on 30 th July 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1a. Suspension. The narrative conclusion was that: Charne Petit suffered from psychotic delusions which she found extremely distressing. From 2019 to 2022 she was treated by the early intervention in psychosis team. Thereafter her care was transferred to the community mental health team. Her symptoms and mood fluctuated, in addition, on occasions, non- compliance with anti-psychotic medication and use of illicit drugs triggered relapses in her mental health. On the 26th March 2023 she suffered a psychotic breakdown and was assessed under the Mental Health Act and found to meet the requirements for detention under s2. No mental health bed was available. She was nursed one to one in the Royal Surrey County Hospital by nurses from the psychiatric liaison team. She was re-started on aripiprazole and her mood stabilized. She was discharged to the home treatment team on the 31st March 2023 without an assessment followed by medical treatment in a mental health hospital. On the 24th April she was seen by her care coordinator and reported intrusive psychotic delusions and struggling to manage her emotions. On the 25th April 2023 she represented to Royal Surrey County Hospital having abused drugs. She was assessed not to require a mental health assessment and discharged. On the 12th May 2023 she killed herself by suspending herself [REDACTED]. The death was preventable with more effective treatment of her psychosis. The lack of a mental health bed after she was assessed as detainable under s2 more than minimally contributed to the death. She died by Suicide","See the details set out in the narrative conclusion. In addition: Ms Petit was reviewed in hospital on the 29 th March 2023 by a consultant from the liaison psychiatry team. Her presentation had improved since admission and in his opinion, so long as she continued to improve, she could be discharged to the home treatment team and that this was the least restrictive option. The effect of the discharge on the 31 st March 2023 was that Ms Petit was not admitted to a mental health hospital under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and was therefore discharged without having been assessed comprehensively in a mental health hospital.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Evidence given by the court appointed expert consultant psychiatrist was that Ms Petit was not adequately medicalised and that she needed assessment and medical review with optimisation of treatment in a mental health hospital. Her response to treatment needed to be observed. This is what a s2 admission is designed to effect. The lack of a bed in a mental health hospital denied Ms Petit this opportunity for optimal treatment. (2) The Court heard that owing to a shortage of mental health beds patients who have been assessed by 2 s12 consultant psychiatrists to require detention after a mental health act assessment are being effectively detained in general hospitals without a section, awaiting a bed, because they cannot be placed under section unless a mental health bed is available. 6"

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Police During the evidence of the PC who attended on the 29/07/22 she informed the court that:  She had had some suicide awareness training when she commenced her role as a police officer some 7 years ago but could not remember it.  She believed that she had had some training in respect of her powers under s.136 of Regulation 28 – After Inquest Template Updated 23/08/2024 TG the Mental Health Act 1983 but could not say when this was.  She demonstrated in her evidence that she did not fully understand when the police powers under this section of the Mental Health Act could be exercised.  She was not aware of the suicide and mental health information available on the Crew Mate App which all officers had access to.  She was a coach for newly qualified officers.  She had not taken part in any joint training with mental health service providers.  She did not make enquiries at the scene that might have been expected, for example, reading the Facebook message in question, asking questions about why the flat was not safe to enter & seeking information from Ryan's mother who was present at the time. Sussex police were afforded the opportunity to provide information about their training provision after the inquest. I have considered this information and I still have concerns. The police have stated that mental health training has been a particular focus for some time. Despite this an officer with a training role was unable to explain what training that was and when they had received it. It appears to me from the police response that whilst mental health training and resources are offered to existing officers it is still not mandatory. I note that new officers joining will be undergoing accredited mental health training but this has not yet been rolled out. Whatever training and resources have been provided I remain concerned it has not been effective and is not repeated as often as may be required to provide officers with the necessary skills and knowledge. Mental health services & joint working with the police The inquest heard evidence from a Street Triage practitioner who was embedded with the police on the 29/07/22. She explained that they are reliant on the police to share relevant information, for example from the police CAD system. In this case not all relevant information was passed to the mental health practitioner in a timely manner. An SPFT witness stated that it was not for them to provide training to the police and that she had not been on any cross-service training. I was informed that a new system of working with the police is being introduced this will be called the 'Rapid Response Service' and mental health workers will no longer be embedded with the police. SPFT has provided me with the way the new system is anticipated to function and this has been helpful in understanding the changes. No policy documents yet exist for this system and an SPFT witness told me that how information is to be shared between them and the police service is yet to be ironed out. Some of this service will not be dissimilar to the Street Triage service. I am concerned because this new approach under the 'Right Care, Right Person' policy will still need police officers to understand mental health issues in order to know when to pass matters on for mental health services to deal and what information to provide. Despite the significant change of working arrangements there does not appear to have been any joint training undertaken; nor am I informed that any is planned. I am concerned that the importance of sharing all relevant information will not be understood unless each organisation understands what information to provide to the other or what questions to ask. 6"

I heard an inquest into his death commencing on the 10 th September 2024. I returned my conclusions on the 12 th September 2024.","The deceased was 28 years old at the time of his death. He lived at home with his family. He had struggled with mixed anxiety and depression for a prolonged period since the death of this parents when he was a child. In September 2022, the deceased made a serious attempt to take his own life by hanging. He was seen at A&E and referred to the Home Treatment Team. The Home Treatment Team referred him to a service to receive psychological/ talking therapies. He was not accepted for by this service (then called Healthy Minds) because they had a policy that they would not accept referrals for individuals who they did not consider to be sufficiently stable. One of the criteria for stability was that the individual should not have attempted suicide or serious self-harm for 3 months. This meant that David was not accepted for this service but was referred by them to the Living Well Neighbourhood mental health team also who in turn referred him to a peer support coach, provided by the Big Life Group. He was discharged from peer support coaching on the 24th April following a lack of engagement but requested that he be considered again by a multi-disciplinary team meeting. The Living Well Neighbourhood mental health team also discharged him on the 24th April 2023 without a further multidisciplinary meeting. It is now accepted by the neighbourhood mental health team that he should not have been discharged on that date. On the 9th May 2023 the deceased was sent a letter by the neighbourhood mental health team which stated that they were discharging him, and that they did not provide the psychological services he had requested. This was incorrect. It is likely that the deceased interpreted that letter to mean that he would not be provided with the help he had requested. I found that the impact of this letter contributed to a deterioration in his mental health in the period leading to his death and that the deceased became withdrawn and isolated. The deceased's grandmother discovered the deceased hanging in the early hours of the 7th August 2023. [REDACTED}. Paramedics attended but pronounced his life to be extinct. Notes found near the deceased indicated a clear intention to end his own life. I found that the deceased intentionally took his own life on the 7th August 2023 following a decline in his mental health which was exacerbated by receiving a letter on the 9th May 2023 discharging him from the neighbourhood mental health team.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. I am concerned that the Home Treatment Team referred David to a service to receive psychological/ talking therapies. This was then called Healthy Minds. This referral took place when the HTT discharged David as they considered him to be sufficiently 'stable' under their HTT definitions. 2. However, David was not accepted for by Healthy Minds because they had a policy that they would not accept referrals for indivduals who they did not consider to be sufficiently 'stable' under their Healthy Minds policies. 3. One of the criteria for stability was that the individual should not have attempted suicide or serious self-harm for 3 months. This was not known to the HTT at the time they made the referral. The effect of this policy meant that David was not accepted for this service, despite him making clear to services that talking therapies was what he needed most to support his mental health. 4. I heard evidence that this policy remains in place within NHS Talking Therapies (the successor to Healthy Minds), but is currently under review. I did not hear any evidence as to if or when it will change. 5. I am concerned that the lack of shared understanding and definition of 'stablilty' for patients along the talking therapies pathway creates a risk of future deaths. 6. I heard evidence that since David's death, the HTT has emailed at the staff at the Tameside HTT to re-iterate the importance of referring cases to SPOE meetings for MDT consideration, and that this has been discussed in two team meetings before February 2024. There was no evidence before me of whether this has been embedded or audited within the team to reduce the risk of future deaths. 6"

Chief Executive Officer Surrey County Council 2. Chief Constable Surrey Police 3. Chief Executive Surrey and Borders Partnership 1,"On 24 th April 2023 an investigation into the death of Helen Jane Kerr was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 th June 2024. Helen Kerr died by hanging. The conclusion as to death was a narrative conclusion as follows: Helen Kerr went to live at in a refuge in Woking on the 2nd February 2023. She had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and was referred to I access. Her mental health deteriorated, and she developed psychosis. On the 1st March 2023 she was assessed at I access and a plan for a referral to the community health team was devised. The referral was not made because of pressure of work. On the 13th March 2023 her support worker was so concerned by her mental health that she called an ambulance and Helen was taken to St Peter's Hospital. She was seen by a nurse from the liaison psychiatry team. No collateral information was sought and the full description of her presentation from the paramedics was not seen. She was assessed as not requiring a referral to the community mental health team despite showing signs of paranoid delusions. She was discharged. Her support workers made repeated attempts to obtain mental health care for Helen contacting the single point of access, I access, the community mental health and the CRISIS line. Helen's case was not discussed with a psychiatrist and her support workers were not contacted for information by any of these organisations. On the 31st March 2023 Helen attended Surrey Police station in an extremely paranoid state and then went to St Peter's Hospital seeking an admission. She was partially assessed by liaison psychiatric nurses and offered a home treatment team assessment. She declined and was discharged by the team without collateral information being sought or the advice of an on-call psychiatrist. She needed to be admitted to hospital for a diagnosis and treatment of her mental health condition. She was discharged from hospital on the 2nd April 2023 and returned to the refuge. She was found dead on the morning of the 3rd April 2023 having self-ligatured. Her condition was amenable to treatment with anti-psychotic medication. The death was avoidable with appropriate treatment. She intended to take her own life. She died by suicide. The death was contributed to by neglect.","See the details set out in the narrative conclusion. In addition: Prior to being placed in the refuge on the 2 nd February 2023 Ms Kerr was charged with carrying a bladed article when she surrendered to bail. She told the police that she was carrying a knife for her own protection. This was known to Surrey Police and mental health services by March 2023. On the 13 th March 2023 paramedics contacted the police for assistance at the refuge concerned because she was carrying a nail file for her own protection. When she attended Surrey Police station on Friday the 31 st March 2023 she did so concerned for her own safety. She was extremely paranoid but was assessed not to warrant s136 detention. She left the police station saying she was going to hospital. A SCARF was written but could not be lodged before the end of the working day on the 31 March 2023. As a result, it was not processed until Monday the 3 rd April 2023, after her death, because SCARF's are processed during working hours. The expert gave evidence was that she would have been very worried if she was told Ms Kerr was carrying a knife because she was having paranoid delusions that she needed to protect herself and her family. Some of Ms Kerr's paranoid delusions related to concerns about the actions refuge workers. The refuge was not contacted by the police on the 31 st March 2023. The court was told that GDPR prevented the police from sharing the information about Ms Kerr with the refuge.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Following the conclusion of the Inquest a considerable amount of evidence has been provided by Surrey and Borders Partnership in relation to changes in procedures in relation to processing of referrals into their services. Referrals into the Single Point of Access can now be made by voluntary agencies and new protocols require more senior oversight of triaging decisions and recording of collateral information from referrers. In addition, a review of the SCARF process is being undertaken but has not yet concluded. However, I remain concerned about a number of matters: The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Cogent information about Ms Kerr's declining mental health was provided repeatedly 3 to Surrey and Borders Partnership secondary mental health teams from the refuge support workers. It was not explored with them, and insufficient weight was given to it during the triage process. Ms Kerr was not provided with appropriate and timely referrals for mental health treatment. Despite the evidence that significant changes are being put in place the efficacy of these changes has not yet been evidenced. (2) Ms Kerr was seen at the police station and hospital in an extremely psychotic and paranoid state. Police records showed that she had been arrested and charged with carrying a bladed article. It was also recorded that she had subsequently carried a nail file, for her own protection. The officer who saw Ms Kerr on the 31st March 2023 was unable to read the records because Ms Kerr's condition meant that the officer could not leave the interview room before Ms Kerr decided to leave the station. The risk this posed to the public was therefore not considered. No action was subsequently taken in relation to the risk. (3) The SCARF process does not enable information sharing between the Police, Mental Health Agencies and Surrey Adult Safeguarding out of hours. It is under review. It remains unclear how information sharing out of hours is to be achieved in a timely fashion to safeguard individuals and the public. (4) The refuge was not made aware of Ms Kerr's presentation on the 31st March 2023 by Surrey Police. Her delusions about the actions of refuge workers could have put them in danger. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 09 September 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide, and the medical cause of death was: I a Blunt Force Chest Trauma I b I c II","The deceased had a complex mental health history with a number of suicide attempts and self-harm having occurred in the months leading up to her death. The most recent occurred on in March when she swallowed batteries and was admitted to Salford Royal Hospital for a period between 25 March 2024 and 12 April 2024. A subsequent attendance following ingestion of batteries occurred on 26 April 2024. On discharge from hospital on 12 April there were delays in being referred to an appropriate mental health team in the community. On 1 May 2024, the deceased presented at Salford Royal Hospital and underwent a mental health assessment with the mental health liaison team, this resulted in a low risk assessment despite the previous attempts to take her own life and a referral to Living well was made. A referral was made to the urgent assessment team on 2 May 2024 by staff at the listening lounge after it was reported by the deceased that she did not feel she could keep herself safe. On 3 May 2024 she was assessed and accepted by the Home Treatment Team and daily visits were arranged with a care plan being agreed. The deceased left home at some point from the evening of 3 May 2024 and was subsequently seen on CCTV at approximately 5:25 on 4 May 2024 walking towards the bridge under which she was found She was discovered below a footbridge on the M602 on 4 May 2024 having fallen onto a crash barrier at the side of the motorway from the bridge above and no signs of life were observed. Death was declared at 06:40. On the balance of probabilities, the deceased fell from the foot bridge above having intended to do so to take her own life. The injuries she sustained in the fall caused her death.",During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. During the course of evidence it was stated that the foot bridge which the deceased fell from had not been considered suitable for amendments to be made to the level of barrier which would prevent a pedestrian crossing the bridge from easily climbing over and falling onto the highway below. 2. Other bridges in the locality were considered and selected for an increase in the height of the barrier or other works to prevent the risk of falling from the bridge onto the M602 motorway. 3. It was unclear on what basis the foot bridge that the deceased fell from has been excluded from such works and there is a risk that this bridge may still be accessed by people who may be at risk of falling as an alternative to other bridges were works had been undertaken in the locality. 6

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide. 1a Hanging 1b 1c II,"Carol Ann Guest resided at home with her partner and did not have a history of mental health problems until 2024. These appear to have been triggered by her mother (for whom she had been caring for for a considerable period of time) being admitted to a care home. There were references in the GP notes to Ms Guest and her family seeking help and support in relation to mental health difficulties, which the family felt were escalating. On the 8th March 2024 a family member contacted the GP expressing concerns regarding escalation of symptoms and Ms Guest having taken excess medication the previous week. The GP did not feel a telephone call that day was indicated but did feel that urgent referral was necessary but regrettably the urgent referral was not sent until a week later. Once received by yourselves on Friday the 15th March, Mrs Guest's referral was placed on the SPA meeting list for the following Thursday (the 20th March) where it was discussed and determined that she would not follow the usual pathway and wait for a routine appointment but that a consultant would visit her the following week. Before that visit could be arranged Ms Guest hanged herself [REDACTED] at her home address on the 24th March 2024.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – During the course of the evidence from both family and medical witnesses it became clear that there were no adequate systems in place for providing crisis support to patients over the age of 65. The family were very concerned and very frustrated by the futile attempts they made to secure psychiatric input and support when they could see a rapidly deteriorating picture. There was no explanation as to why individuals in crisis who were 65 or under had access to the crisis service but once a person is over 65 that service is no longer available to them. It is not clear whether access to such services would have altered the outcome but the current structure and services available in my view denied Ms Guest with the opportunity of obtaining specialist assessment support at a much earlier stage. A further concern was that the GP surgery provides patients with the crisis number seemingly without appreciating that this would only be available to those who were 65 or under. Furthermore, the family's evidence was that when they called 101 seeking medical input and support for Ms Guest, they were told they would be referred to the crisis team but as soon as Ms Guest's age was mentioned they halted that process and said that they would not be able to refer her after all because of her age. 6."

The deceased attended an appointment at St George's Park Hospital on the 12 February 2022. After the appointment she was waiting for a taxi, walking up and down the corridor and appeared to be getting more agitated. She was not happy with how her appointment went and voiced those concerns verbally. When the taxi arrived, she refused to get in and the taxi left. She remained at reception where she voiced her anger at the Crisis Team and requested a Complaints Form. I describe it as a note of intent and do not repeat its content. It is not referred to in any witness statements, it is not referred to in the Serious Incident Investigation. I heard it was discussed at the After Action Review but it has not made its way through to the Serious Incident Investigation. It was disclosed to my office on Friday 16 August 2024 and of greater concern the family were not aware of its existence. I am concerned this significant information was not made available much earlier.

2. I am told the administrative staff do not read complaint forms and it is the process that complaint forms are placed in an envelope without being read or considered and are sent straight to another hospital. However it appears as part of the triage the envelope containing the complaint form is opened at that hospital by a mixture of administrative staff and clinical staff. I am concerned that important information from a patient could be missed and there could also be a significant delay in administering treatment or intervention."

Post-mortem investigations indicated she had died from a fatal overdose. Juliette had been missing since the evening of 14/02/2024 when she left home following difficulties in her personal life and was last seen alive by a friend at around 22:00 on 14/02/2024. Juliette was seen crying on the porch of her friend's home on Fallowfield Road before heading in the direction of [REDACTED]. She had a history of mental health illness since 2010 and had been under the care of both her GP and her local mental health team. At the time of her death, Juliette had been awaiting a follow-up appointment with the mental health team since January 2023 which had been delayed due to staffing shortages, but it is unlikely that her death could have been prevented.

Following Juliette's death, a Structured Judgement Review (""SJR"") was carried out which identified steps that have been taken. However, the SJR confirmed that a review of Rio records was being undertaken of those who have not been seen in over 12 months with actions to be identified, and that clinical stratification of current caseload is ongoing.

(4) The Deceased's family and support network was in London and not Stockton. (5) Returning to Stockton was a source of great anxiety for the Deceased. She commented that she would “rather die than return to Middlesbrough [sic]”. (6) It was clear to treating clinicians that securing the right accommodation was paramount to her mental health prognosis and to her future more generally. (7) It was clear to treating clinicians that surrounding the Deceased with a positive supportive network of family was crucial in maintaining mental health. (8) Despite all of the above, the existing framework/rules were such that all London boroughs, correctly applying the relevant criteria, rejected the Deceased's applications for accommodation in London. (9) The witness evidence was clear that there was no “discretion” and that London Boroughs and treating clinicians alike were powerless. The Deceased was therefore discharged to Stockton, against her wishes, against medical advice, away from her support network, and to an area where she would have to at best face her demons and at worst be in physical danger.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Please see Box 4, above. The evidence at the Inquest was that this situation is not uncommon, with those detained under the MHA not infrequently having social circumstances such that their historical place of residency is, for whatever reason, deeply inappropriate (or even dangerous). It should be noted that section 117 Mental Health Act 1983 did not apply. I am concerned that the rigidity and lack of flexibility in the criteria, coupled with the evidence this is a not uncommon phenomenon, gives rise to a risk of future deaths in cases which do not meet the threshold for aftercare under s.117. Consideration should be given to giving decision makers greater latitude / discretion or the power to apply common sense, in circumstances where (a) it is foreseeable that rigid adherence to criteria will lead to personal injury (including psychiatric injury) and/or serious emotional harm (b) there is an obvious alternative solution, such as accommodation near family. 6"

Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) At inquest, Matthew's mother gave evidence that she was never informed of the terms upon which Matthew's section 17 leave had been authorised by those responsible for his treatment and specifically that Matthew should never be left alone or unaccompanied whilst on section 17 leave nor was she provided with a copy of Matthew's section 17 leave form. The Trust acknowledged and admitted that there was no evidence in any records available to it that such discussions had been had with Matthew's mother or that a copy of the section 17 leave form had been provided to her. The Trust gave evidence of changes implemented since Matthew's tragic death to avoid future recurrence and I requested additional evidence from the Trust in relation to audited compliance data. Notwithstanding changes already implemented and envisaged and by its own admission, the Trust's compliance data is ""inconsistent"" generally but specifically in relation to the provision of the section 17 leave form to a carer/ person accompanying a patient subject to section 17 leave. That evidence demonstrated a 50% compliance rate in December 2023, a 52% compliance rate in March 2024 and a 76% compliance rate in May 2024, with a compliance rate of 80% or above considered to be ""good"" by reference to the Trust's compliance criteria. Additionally and in relation to changes already implemented, the Trust's evidence at inquest was that its revised section 17 leave policy for detained patients had removed the previous requirement that the section 17 leave form ought tot be signed by the person accompanying the patient, the explanation for this being the Trust's roll-out of a new digitised system. The inconsistent compliance audit data referenced above gives rise to a concern that there is risk that future deaths could occur consequent to this change unless action is taken. 6"

The inquest was heard before myself sitting without a Jury and my conclusion at inquest was one of Suicide.

The medical cause of Mr Sanghera's death was recorded as

1a) Compatible with a combination of drowning and [REDACTED]

1. At 5.23pm on 12 February 2023, a call was made to West Midlands Police to report a male running around naked in Wolverhampton.

2. Mr Parminder Sanghera was detained and arrested for outraging public decency. He had a head injury and displaying behaviour that concerned officers about his mental health and was taken to New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton.

3. They arrived at hospital at 6.26pm and was discharged as fit for detention at 11.47pm after being treated.

4. Mr Sanghera was then taken to Oldbury custody suite where a risk assessment was undertaken, and his detention authorised at 12:34am on 13 February 2023.

5. Mr Sanghera was kept in custody throughout the night under level 3 observations and was seen by a Health Care Professional (HCP) during the night.

6. A decision was made to release Mr Sanghera without charge, and a pre-release risk assessment completed at 1.51pm on 13 February 2023, stated ""no"" for concerns about risk of suicide or self-harm following release.

7. The custody records further stated that Mr Sanghera was suffering from behavioural issues and that he had been reviewed by L&D (Liaison and Diversion) and assessed for mental health issues the day before. He was not found to warrant a full Mental Health Act assessment the previous day.

8. Mr Sanghera was reported to be unwilling to leave and force was used to escort him from the cell and the custody suite by two police staff.

9. Transport arrangements were not deemed necessary, and it was stated that he was not showing signs of mental vulnerability.

10. External CCTV footage showed that after Mr Sanghera left custody at around 1.55pm. He stood outside the custody suite for a period. He then walked away from the custody suite and returned to the car park area numerous times. He was last seen on CCTV outside the custody suite at 3.52pm walking towards the canal towpath.

11. At 5.00pm a log was created that a male had been found deceased in the canal near to Oldbury custody suite. He was discovered face down with a [REDACTED]. An ambulance attended and sadly life was pronounced extinct at 6pm at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. During the course of the inquest, I heard evidence Mr Sanghera was deemed to be suffering from behavioural issues rather than a mental health crisis and no full Mental Health Act assessment took place either at New Cross Hospital or whilst in custody at Oldbury Police station. 2. The risk assessments performed in hospital and police custody identified no concerns of risk of suicide or self-harm from release. However, evidence at the inquest showed that he was suffering from a mental health crisis at the time. 3. My concern is that given the erratic behaviour he was displaying and his vulnerability, further consideration should have been given for a full mental health act assessment to take place before release. Therefore, you may wish to consider reviewing the arrangements and assessments required before discharge from hospital or being released from custody. 6"

A probable contributing factor was the extended lock up due to the covid regime and staff shortages meaning that Mr Steadman had not left his cell at all on 26/02/2022. A possible contributing factor was the inadequate implementation of the ACCT process on 26/02/2022","In January 2020 Craig Steadman was released from Custody on Licence but a week later he breached a condition and was remanded back to HMP Winchester on 13th January. He had Diabetes and a mental health history, was on a weekly anti psychotic injection plus a history of multiple self harming incidents including overdosing on [REDACTED]. . After being assessed as suitable to hold his own medication he overdosed on [REDACTED] on 17th January 2020 and was placed on an ACCT which was closed again on 18th January. He struggled with the Covid Lock Down restrictions and lack of contact with his family. On 26th February he self harmed, cutting himself [REDACTED], and the ACCT was reopened. At 00:44 he was found suspended by a ligature [REDACTED].

Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) There were several investigations into Craig Steadman's death including a post incident review by HMP Winchester, the PPO,and the prison healthcare provider. Various recommendations flowed from the above. However upon questioning of various members of staff called to give evidence at the Inquest it became clear that several of them were not aware of the findings of the investigations nor the recommendations. The reports had not been shared with staff directly involved with Craig during his recent time in custody. It is not possible for learning to be fully disseminated and acted upon if there is no process for sharing the findings of those organisations tasked with investigating deaths in custody and discussing these with the relevant Prison/Healthcare staff. 6"

All three inquests were resumed and concluded on 30 th July 2024. The causes of death were: Emma Pattison: 1.a: Shock and Haemorrhage 1.b: Shotgun wounds to chest and abdomen Ellette Pattison: 1.a: Shotgun Wound to the Head George Pattison: 1.a: Shotgun Wound to the Head The conclusions were: Emma Pattison: Unlawfully killed Ellette Pattison: Unlawfully killed George Pattison: Suicide,"At a time, unknown between 22:49 hours on the 4 th February 2023 and 00:40 hours on 5 th February 2023 George Pattison shot and killed his wife Emma Pattison aged 45 years and his daughter Ellette Pattison aged 7 years. Thereafter he shot himself intra-orally. At the time of her death, Emma Pattison was the headteacher at Epsom College, Epsom, Surrey and she lived with her family at the head teacher's house which was situated within the College park. The firearm which George Pattison used was a shotgun lawfully held by him under Shotgun Certificate Number [REDACTED]. That certificate was originally issued by Surrey Police in 2012. In 2016, the police were notified of a domestic violence incident, whereby it was alleged that Emma Pattison had assaulted George Pattison. The matter was investigated and, although the certificate was removed temporarily, it was later returned. There was a renewal application in December 2016 which was granted and a further application for renewal in 2022, which was also granted. The last renewal application required completion of a new form by the applicant, providing details of the applicant's GP and answers by him to medical questions, which included, have you ever been diagnosed or treated for any of a number of medical conditions, which included 'Depression or anxiety', to which the applicant responded 'No'. The inclusion of the GP's details and medical questions is a safeguard to ensure that the Licensing Officer is aware of an applicant's medical history. (Please see my earlier PFD Report dated 15 th July 2019 relating to the inquests touching the deaths of Christine and Lucy Lee.) However, George Pattison had consulted an on-line GP and, over the course of 2019 to 2021, had been prescribed a significant amount of Propanolol, the purpose of which was to assist with the symptoms of anxiety. It is unknown whether knowledge of that medical history on the part of the Licensing Officer would have affected the renewal of the shotgun certificate to Mr Pattison. Further, as set out above, in 2016 there was an allegation of assault made by Mr Pattison against Mrs Pattison. It would appear that, at the time, no consideration was given as to whether this might have been an example of coercive controlling behaviour on the part of Mr Pattison. However, there was evidence within the papers of subsequent domestic abuse / coercive controlling behaviour on the part of Mr Pattison towards Mrs Pattison. That evidence does not appear to have come to attention of the Licensing Officer at the time of Mr Pattison's most recent application for renewal of the licence.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters that gave rise to concerns that circumstances creating a risk of other deaths will continue to exist in the future unless action is taken. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. An applicant for a shotgun certificate is able to obtain medication from an on-line doctor without the knowledge of their GP, giving rise to a risk that a licensing authority might grant a shotgun certificate to an applicant who has a relevant previous medical history about which the authority is not aware. 2. In consulting an on-line doctor, it is possible for an applicant for a shotgun certificate to avoid the current safeguards relating to full disclosure of their previous and current medical history. RT3589 4 3. Consideration should be given as to how a licensing authority can obtain full and accurate disclosure of an applicant's history of coercive controlling behaviour towards another / others. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . A jury found that: Sean Davies died on 25th February 2023, between the hours of 03:00 and 07:15am, by means of suspension, [REDACTED], in cell FS1-02 at HMP Swaleside. He had an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection with a tariff of 5 years imposed in November 2012. This lead to the progression from his status as a B category prisoner to a C category prisoner and its revocation on the 1st October 2022, followed by an unsuccessful appeal of that decision. with a narrative conclusion: Suicide Factors relevant to the death, but which cannot be concluded to have caused or contributed to the death include, a lack of communication and handovers between staff and insufficiently completed welfare checks. 1a Suspension 1b 1c II","Sean Davies, aged 30 at the time of his death, was remanded into custody in November 2011 for an offence of violence. In November 2012 he was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP), the minimum term being seven years later reduced to five years on appeal. He became eligible for parole in November 2017. In 2021 Mr. Davies transferred to HMP Swaleside in order to join the psychologically informed planned environment (PIPE) unit where he was able to fully engage with a programme which improved his chances of parole. In April 2023 he was assessed as suitable for a category C prison but this was revoked in October 2023 following an incident in August when unprescribed medication was found in his cell. Following this Mr. Davies expressed feelings of hopelessness at clinical sessions but continued to engage and underwent a psychological assessment on 7 th February 2023 which was reported to have gone well. A parole hearing had not been scheduled. On 10 th February 2023 Mr. Davies was informed of the outcome of the justice committee's review of IPP sentences in that their recommendation for a resentencing exercise had been rejected by the government Thereafter he declined to participate in a further psychological assessment and suspended himself in the early hours of 25 th February 2023. There was CCTV evidence of him [REDACTED]. The [REDACTED] was visible to anyone patrolling the landing and was seen by an operational support group officer who pointed it out to another but neither reported it. Mr. Davies left a note stating that he had taken his own life because of the IPP sentence. He expressed frustration at the slow progress of his sentence, re-categorisation and concerns about how the parole board would view this and his past behaviour. He saw no chance of being released. He went on to say that he hoped that his death would contribute for them to change the laws of the IPP sentence.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) There are currently 55 prisoners at HMP Swaleside subject to IPP sentences. It has been recognised by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman that an IPP sentence should be regarded as a potential risk factor for sucide and self harm (learning lessons bulletin September 2023). In the clinical review following the death of Mr. Davies a recommendation was made that the Governor and Head of Healthcare ensure that a risk formulation was completed for all prisoners subject to IPP sentences, that it was regularly reviewed and updated including where there has been an event that may increase a person's risk of suicide and self harm. Such formulation should be made readily available for all staff to refer and be stored within the prison and medical records. I understood from representations made on behalf of the Ministry of Justice that a 'national strategy' was intended for IPP prisoners. At the end of the inquest I gave the Governor and Head of Healthcare some time to notify me of the steps that had been taken in relation to the recommendation of the clinical review and any interim measures in respect of the 'national strategy'. Whilst I have been provided with the changes in practice that have been put in place by Head of Healthcare, I have been asked by the cafer custody team at HMP Swaleside to issue a Regulation 28 report so that a considered response can be provided in relation to this matter and the concerns below (2) It was clear from CCTV evidence that prison officers and operational support group officers were not conducting roll call welfare checks and other welfare checks in line with national guidance or local policies (3) One operational support group officer had not received training in relation to fire regulations or handovers, another did not act in accordance with the training 6."

On the 25 July 2024 I concluded an Inquest into his death at the end of a 3-day hearing.,"The immediate circumstances are that: On 24 March 2023, Martyn was detained by police in Sussex after being found at [REDACTED] where he had ostensibly gone to take his own life. He was taken to Eastbourne District General Hospital. There he was assessed and deemed liable for detention under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. However, there were no available mental health beds nationally and a suitable placement could not be found for him. Having been at the hospital since Friday evening, he contacted family members on Sunday, 26 March who collected him and brought him back to his home in Oxfordshire. On 27 March 2023, Martyn left his home and stepped in front of a lorry on the A4074. Witnesses described his actions as deliberate. The medical cause of death was determined following a post-mortem examination to be multi-organ failure and polytrauma resulting from a road traffic collision .","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – As you will note from the Conclusion, an application for compulsory detention for Martyn could not be completed due to the unavailability of beds despite extensive searches nationally. My findings were that: 'It is the case that a Health Based Place of Safety bed did become available but a decision was taken that due to anticipated demand for potential patients not to offer this to Martyn.' And also that: 'in my view highly likely that Martyn would have benefitted from a further admission to hospital – as he had previously – and he would have prevented from further relapse and ultimately taking the actions he did on the morning of the 27 March.' I heard evidence from experience mental health professionals that the lack of beds for those requiring detention under the Mental Health Act was a frequent occurrence. In my view, you should consider a review of sufficiency of provision for suitable placements for those requiring compulsory treatment. 6"

The inquest into his death concluded before a Jury on 22 July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that Kevin had died by suicide. The Jury further recorded a narrative conclusion capturing a series of failings in his prison and health care, which probably more than minimally contributed to his death from suicide.","On 29 September 2022, Kevin was discovered deceased in his cell, having died as a result of ligature asphyxiation. He had a long history of mental ill health, paranoia and self-harm behaviours. He was placed on an ACCT plan and had identified 29 September 2022 as a trigger date when he might be more susceptible to self-harm and suicide on account of this being the anniversary of a relative's death. There was a failure by prison staff to perform a planned ACCT review on 28 September 2022 and on 29 September 2022. Staff on the wing were unaware of the trigger date identified in the ACCT because this risk pertinent information was not passed on in handover and the ACCT booklet had been taken off of the wing for quality assurance (so was not accessible to staff). Landing staff were unaware that Kevin was on an ACCT so did not perform any ACCT checks on the morning of his death. Kevin had appeared agitated overnight and had not slept at all. This information was not shared with day staff. There was a failure to provide Kevin with the necessary support for his mental health in terms of therapy, medication review and psychiatric assessment. Following the death, the ACCT observation and conversation history sheet for 29 September 2022 (which had been blank from the day shift at the time of death) was amended by staff, under the supervision of a senior officer, to record all interactions with Kevin that morning, even though none of those interactions were in fact ACCT checks. This tampering with evidence misled the Prison and Probation Ombudsman's investigation, and only fully came to light during the inquest.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Prison staff were unfamiliar with the need for ACCT observations and conversations to be meaningful and have purpose. Witnesses repeatedly described these checks as simply “proof of life” checks. One witness gave the example of an ACCT observation being completed simply by hearing a noise from within the cell or observing the prisoner collecting his lunch from two landings above. Such cursory observations of prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm is inconsistent with the aims and objectives of the ACCT PSI (64/22011). 2. Prison staff have not read and understood the July 2021 annex to PSI 64/2011. There was a failure to share risk pertinent information about Kevin to all staff caring for him that day. 3. Failure to secure and retain documentary evidence following a death in custody. If post-death investigations are misled by inaccurate documentation that has been amended post-death, then the ability to learn from deaths in custody will be hampered. The preservation of accurate documentary evidence must be of paramount concern when a person dies in custody. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held between 22-25 July 2024.,"Kieran had experienced anxiety and depressive symptoms for around 10 years with worsening symptoms in late 2023. In November he consulted his GP having inadvertently stopped taking his anti-depressant medication. On 5/12 he reported worsening symptoms after restarting his medication for two weeks, and said he had thoughts of jumping in front of a vehicle and an overdose, citing the breakdown of his relationship with his wife as one of the triggers. He was referred to the Crisis team and assessed on 7/12 reporting no active suicidal plans. His anti-depressant medication was increased, and he agreed to be seen routinely in 4 months. The following day, on 8/12 he booked into a hotel to overdose on his medication with alcohol. He was surprised to wake up and was admitted to the Emergency Department early on 9/12. Psychiatry & Liaison referred him to the Psychiatric Decisions Unit ('PDU') for further assessment as he could not guarantee his safety. He arrived at the Oleaster Centre, Birmingham at 9:55pm. The following day, early morning on 10/12 during a nurse assessment he said he was angry the overdose attempt had not worked, and if he went home, he would maybe throw himself in front of a lorry. He cited in part the relationship breakdown with his wife as one of the triggers for his presentation. Later that day, he was assessed by a consultant psychiatrist whose impression was of a depressive episode, and that Kieran required informal admission as he did not feel safe to go home, which Kieran agreed with. The following day, by 11am on 11/12 Kieran proactively contacted a second nurse reporting when outside the unit for a cigarette he had terrible thoughts, and he does not feel safe going outside because he thinks he needs to kill himself and he will run and jump in front of a car or train. Around 1-2pm he was assessed by a junior Dr and reported no active suicidal plans, but her impression was he was very anxious and depressed, and the plan was maintained. The long wait for a bed was due to the mental health service having no available inpatient bed. A private mental health service agreed to admit him in Willenhall. Kieran's wife had arrived to drop off some clothes and Kieran asked if his wife could drive him. The bed manager, also the nurse in charge of the Oleaster Centre, had intended that Kieran be transported via taxi accompanied by a member of staff, but agreed to his wife driving him on the basis Kieran was a voluntary inpatient, wanted treatment, and assessed his presentation on and off the PDU as raising no safety concerns. He did not record his risk formulation. He was not aware of the two reports of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision. Had he looked at the 'level 1 risk screening' neither nurse had at this stage updated the 'suicide' box. No record of his suicidal ideation on 10/12 was ever added, and the suicidal ideation reported on the morning 11/12 was not added until 8:51pm and after the incident had occurred. Whether his wife's presence would exacerbate Kieran's presentation was not fully considered, or the length and nature of the journey. His wife was not informed of Kieran's reported suicidal ideation. The mental health service's policies, procedures and guidelines did not set out a clear approach to assist regarding what should happen when a patient requests for family to transfer them to another location for an informal admission. Kieran left with his wife in her car around 7:45pm. Shortly after 8pm, having just spoken on the phone to his mum, he suddenly proceeded to open the passenger door whilst in lane 1 of the M5 motorway. His wife attempted to physically stop him whilst managing to move to the hard-shoulder whereby Kieran exited the passenger door and walked around the rear of the car into the path of an oncoming large lorry in lane 1, and thereafter was struck by a second car. He was confirmed deceased at the scene from the consequential injuries (1a. Multiple injures). The inquest conclusion was: “Suicide, contributed to by a failure to conduct an adequate patient transport risk assessment which would have likely changed the outcome.”","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. Critical suicide risk information was not recorded at all or not recorded in a timely manner. On 10/12/23, the experienced nurse did not record at all in the 'suicide' box on the 'level 1 – risk screening' the first report of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision. She described this omission as an error and the likely explanation was that she was the only nurse working on a very busy shift. On 11/12/23, the experienced nurse did not in a timely manner record in the 'suicide' box on the 'level 1 – risk screening' the second report of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision received by 11am. She said the likely explanation for not updating the 'suicide' box until 8:51pm (and after the nurse-in-charge made his transport risk formulation) was that she was the only nurse working on a very busy shift. The experienced Nurse-in-Charge did not record at all his transport risk formulation saying that was not his usual practice. The Patient Safety Manager said long standing trust policy required clinicians to record key information as soon as possible. I am not persuaded this long standing policy is sufficient by itself to remove the risk in the future of critical suicide risk information not being recorded at all or in a timely manner given three experienced nurses within 24 hours failed to follow the policy. 2. Post-death trust learning led to new guidance for when an informal patient requests family, carer, or friend transport them from PDU. For ease of reference it states: “Where appropriate, it is reasonable for the option of an informal patient to be transported by family/carer/friends. In all such cases, decision needs to be based on the risk/benefit ratio and this also needs to be clearly discussed with the person transporting to make sure there is understanding and agreement. This needs to be clearly documented within the patient's notes. If there is any concern or disagreement expressed by the person, family/carer/friends, then alternative arrangements need to be made by us.” I am not persuaded this is sufficient to remove the risk of an inadequate risk assessment in the future. By way of contrast, trust guidance C52 'Mental Health Act Transport of Patients' - which applies when a patient has been assessed under the Act and ambulance service transport is to be used - at paragraph 12 includes 15 specific questions that the risk assessor should ask as part of the transport risk formulation, including: How far does the patient have to travel? What is the patients age and gender? What is their current state of mind? Is there a risk to the driver/accompanying individuals? The updated guidance cited above is absent any equivalent specific questions or assistance on when it is or is not appropriate. For example, in Kieran's case clinicians were aware his sex, age, and background of relationship breakdown statistically recognised him as being at a higher risk of suicide, PDU is only intended for a brief stay whereas Kieran was there for nearly 48 hours and his state of mind was not assessed in the hours before the risk formulation (even thought it was known to fluctuate), the journey if considered would have been noted to take him away from local roads onto a high speed motorway, and his wife/the driver was known to be a trigger for his low mood. Further, there was no consideration of what his wife had to be told to ensure she was safe, providing genuine informed consent given the interplay of patient confidentially. In Kieran's case the transport risk formulation did not consider whether his risk of suicide included road OFFICIAL traffic collision vs an unrelated mechanism. My concern is the above cited guidance in simply stating the decision should be based on 'appropriateness' and 'the risk/benefit ratio' does not sufficiently prompt clinicians to consider the full range of key issues and is inconsistent with the more expansive guidance in C52 for when an ambulance is to be used. For completeness, (1) there was discussion during the inquest about why there cannot be a blanket ban on informal patients with recent suicidal ideation via road traffic collision being transported by family etc given they represent a very small cohort of patients. If no such ban is considered appropriate, in my view, the need for more expansive and specific guidance for clinicians equivalent to C52 is increased, and (2) there was discussion at the inquest of a transport risk formulation based on a points system with a written draft suggestion from the Family's counsel; I attach a copy which may be of assistance for the trust when deciding what if any action to take. 6"

His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service 1,"An investigation was commenced into the death of Matthew Paul Braben, aged 30. The investigation concluded on 26 April 2024. The conclusion of the jury in the inquest was: Suicide. Matthew's death was probably the result of systemic failures across multiple agencies including the Prison services. A contributing factor to these failures may have been Covid. There was inadequate communication between agencies and a lack of information sharing. This probably led to a failure to identify his deteriorating mental health and increasing suicide risk. This is evidenced by repeated failures to open ACCTs post February. Despite concerns raised by a highly engaged, caring and supportive family, it is probable insufficient weight was given to their attempts to raise the alarm. The medical cause of death was: 1a Aspyhxia 1b Suffocation [REDACTION]","Matthew died on 16th August 2021 at HMP Wormwood Scrubs, Du Cane Road, Hammersmith. Matthew was remanded in custody in January 2021. It was his first time in prison. He was on an ACCT in early February 2021 but not thereafter. He was referred to be seen by a counselling service. His first-born child was born on 27th July 2021. The birth of a child is not listed a risk factor in PSI 64/2011. He was awaiting sentencing. He was seen by a nurse in prison on 31st July 2021 with cut wrists. His family repeatedly raised concerns about his mental health. He was first assessed by the counselling service on 2nd August 2021, declined counselling on 11th August 2021 and was consequently discharged from that service. No action was taken by the prison when repeated concerns were raised by his family on Saturday 14th August 2021. He was last seen alive on Sunday 15th August 2021. He was found in his cell on 16th August 2021 after he had tied [REDACTED] around his neck and tied his wrists and ankles to the bed. He died due to asphyxia. At the time that he did the act that caused his death, he probably did so with the intention of ending his life. On the balance of probabilities, there were numerous failings by the prison service that cumulatively contributed to Matthew's death, including: a failure to record and keep complete records on NOMIS or otherwise; a failure to communicate between colleagues and shifts; and a failure to follow up closure of his ACCT and resignation of wing cleaner role. It was unacceptable that multiple opportunities, that would constitute opening an ACCT, were missed (April, July, August 2021). The prison failed to act on repeated serious concerns raised by Matthew's family on Saturday 14th August through the Safer Custody Helpline. It is possible that multiple opportunities were missed to identify concerns with Matthew's mental health due to the Key Worker System not being fully implemented throughout HMP Wormwood Scrubs. Covid may have been a significant contributor to some of these failings due to increased work pressures and regime changes. On the balance of probabilities, the implementation of the policy in relation to the opening of ACCTs was inadequate. It was noted by a Supervising Officer that there was an implied pressure not to open an ACCT due to associated workload pressures. Post closure period processes for ACCTs were not adhered to after Matthew arrived in E wing. If these were effectively followed, then risks could have been more readily identified. This failure probably contributed to Matthew's death. Post Matthew's arrival to E wing, there were numerous red flags over an extended period across all services (e.g. prison Services, PPG, secondary mental healthcare, Forward Trust and Atrium) that should have resulted in an ACCT being opened – failure to do so probably contributed to Matthew's death. On the balance of probabilities, Matthew's risk of suicide was not adequately identified. Post move to E wing and closure of the ACCT, there were numerous failures to identify suicide risks. Not enough weight was given to known risk factors such as the birth of Matthew's daughter, approaching court dates, first time in prison and feelings of guilt, shame and paranoia. These were not given due credence in comparison to Matthew's assurances that he was not suicidal. As Matthew's mental health deteriorated towards the end of July, a series of escalating risk indicators arose. Family concerns were raised to Safer Custody and escalated to the Supervising Officer and secondary mental health services. No action was taken by the prison when repeated concerns were raised by his family on Saturday 14th August. These inadequacies in the identification of suicide risk cumulatively probably contributed to Matthew's death. The Court heard evidence that prisoners were locked in their cells for up to 23 hours a day, with a negative effect on their mental health. The Court heard evidence that one of the ways that prisoners could leave their cells is to attend gym, but that there is a shortage of gym instructors due to the manner of training of gym instructors which entails potential trainees having to attend training at a distant location for significant period of times rather than locally as well as the length of the course, both of which serve as significant disincentives for staff to be trained as gym instructors.","During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The birth of a child is not recognised as a specific risk factor in PSI 64/2011 which means that staff may under-estimate its significance on mental health. 2. The robustness of the process for ensuring that the ACCT post-closure process is followed, particularly following a move to another location. 3. Training of staff in the ACCT process. 4. Prisoners being kept in their cells for up to 23 hours a day, with a negative effect on their mental health. 5. The manner of training of gym instructors which entails potential trainees having to attend training at a distant location for significant period of times rather than locally as well as the length of the course, both of which serve as significant disincentives for staff to be trained as gym instructors. The shortage of gym instructors leads directly to more prisoners being kept in their cells for up to 23 hours a day, with a negative effect on their mental health. 3 6"

The inquest concluded on 8 July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that Beth had died by suicide.","On 18 February 2023, Bethany Paige Langton was discovered deceased inside her bedroom at [REDACTED], having died following the ingestion of [REDACTED] which she had sourced online in January 2023. Beth had used the internet to research how to die using [REDACTED] and followed the advice she had found online. Beth deliberately ingested the substance with the intention of bringing about her death. Beth was vulnerable having been diagnosed with complex mental health diagnoses.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The continued ease of availability of Sodium Nitrite to members of the public. The substance is lethal when ingested, even in relatively small quantities. It's use in suicide is increasing. The substance is readily available to purchase online without the need for any explanation of the purchaser's intended use for the substance, or an end user certificate/licence to track where it is being distributed. 2. Lack of awareness amongst businesses that the substance is being obtained for this purpose. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The company who supplied Beth with the sodium nitrite used in her death, had no idea that the substance might be sourced by individuals for this purpose. Had they have been aware of the risk, they would likely have improved systems for investigating the intended use, or would have stopped offering the item for sale to individuals, as they have now done so. 3. Beth used the internet to research how to source and use sodium nitrite to bring about her death. She followed that guidance meticulously. That same guidance was still readily available on the internet at the time of her inquest, although I believe it might now have been removed. What system is in place to ensure that such websites are detected promptly and made unavailable to the public in a timely fashion? 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 23 July 2024. The conclusion was that Danny Anderson died as a result of suicide, contributed to by neglect.","Danny Anderson suffered from chronic mental health difficulties, which first developed around the age of 15. His past psychiatric history included serious incidents of self-harm and necessary admissions to hospital under the provisions of the Mental Health Act. In 2022, Danny required a six-week admission to hospital in February/March 2022, due to paranoid and delusional beliefs. In June 2022, Danny again required admission under the Mental Health Act for paranoid and delusional beliefs. He received care and assessment in hospital under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. He received a number of possible diagnoses during the course of the admission. Evidence is accepted from an independent psychiatric expert, that Danny was likely to have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in 2022. This is based upon his presenting condition, requiring the admissions to hospital, and based upon his presentation throughout the six-month period in hospital – June to December 2022. Danny's condition was not correctly diagnosed before discharge from hospital. Danny was entitled to Section 117 after-care but no significant attention was given to his Section 117 after-care needs. Danny should have been assessed for supported accommodation. This was not done and supported accommodation was not sought for him. Danny was discharged to grossly inadequate hotel accommodation. Danny was discharged from hospital on the 14 December 2022. There was no comprehensive assessment of risk prior to discharge. There was no comprehensive safety plan put into place for him. Danny had stated his intention to stop his anti-psychotic medication before he was discharged from hospital, but no plan was put in place to address the clear risks of non-compliance with medication. The community mental health team did not communicate to the housing team, the importance of Danny being placed within the area of the community mental health team. Danny was placed out of area and was not seen face to face by his care co-ordinator before his discharge from the community team. Telephone contacts between Danny and his care co-ordinator raised significant concerns about Danny's mental health and living circumstances. Despite this, he was discharged from the community mental health team following telephone contact on the 18 January 2023. No communication was sent to Danny's GP to inform them of the discharge from mental health services. On the 30 March 2023, Danny was found hanging inside his room at [REDACTED] . Paramedics attended and pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. Danny took his own life, whilst suffering from a mental illness, and whilst receiving absolutely no care from the mental health services. Danny's death was contributed to by cumulative failures, amounting to a gross failure, to provide mental health care to him","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: There was no evidence of any adequate formulation of risk prior to Danny's discharge from hospital on the 14 December 2022 and no evidence of any adequate risk formulation prior to Danny's discharge from the community mental health team in January 2023. The statement “Danny does not present with any suicidal ideation or self-harming behaviour“ was copied and pasted multiple times throughout the risk assessment template on the 14 December 2022. There was no analysis or formulation of risk for 3 Danny. From review of the records throughout the admission, I am concerned that there was an over-reliance upon Danny's answer to questions posed about suicidal ideation and intent. At the point of discharge, there was no evidence of information gathering around Danny's mental state, behaviour, psychiatric history, history of abuse, social situation – and evidence that this information was used to form a judgment about the likelihood or probability of an adverse or harmful outcome (in accordance with the Trust's risk policy). There was no evidence of any consideration of Danny's historical factors and experiences, more recent problems and existing strengths and resources (in accordance with the NICE guidelines 2022). Witnesses from consultant level to care co-ordinator level, were unable to describe a robust risk assessment process. I am concerned that staff do not fully understand how to assess and manage risk. There was no safety plan on discharge from hospital, or prior to discharge from the community team, to address the clear risks that Danny posed. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Nathan Tesla George Scantlebury died as a consequence of asphyxia following a [REDACTED]. The [REDACTED] event was a deliberate act but it cannot be established on the evidence that he intended the outcome to be fatal. Nate's death was contributed to by:- 1. A failure to take appropriate steps to ensure Nate's safety when the [REDACTED] was first observed and whilst it was still loose; and 2. Neglect Nate's death was possibly contributed to by:- 1. The lack of availability generally of suitable placements for children with complex mental health needs. 2. Failures by the Local Authority and the Clinical Commissioning Group to adequately assess the suitability of the placement to meet Nate's needs; 3. A lack of understanding by the local authority and the clinical commissioning group of the way in which the model of care used in the placement worked in practice and whether this would meet Nate's needs. 4. Failings by the clinical commissioning group and the local authority to ensure that a s117 after-care plan was in place to ensure that all professionals involved in Nate's care were aware of their respective role and responsibilities,"Nathan Scantlebury was just 16 years old at the time of his death. He had a complex mental health needs and was a looked after child, having been so since December 2013. Nate had a significant history of self-harm and spent several periods detained under the Mental Health Act. Nate had previously been placed at a placement in Wales, specialising in providing care to Young People with high risk self-harming behaviours. Following a serious incident in August 2018, Nate was detained under the Mental Health Act with the placement considering they could no longer keep him safe. Following a period of detention, the only placement available for Nate was in a mainly adult service, with a least restrictive approach adopting a therapeutic risk-taking and recovery- based approach. The service provided care for those aged between 16 and 25. During the course of Nate's placement, a number of concerns were raised in respect of the suitability of the service for Nate, with a number of self-harming incidents taking place which required hospital treatment. On the 25th September 2019, Nate tied a [REDACTED] around his neck, initially the [REDACTED] was loose and Nate was left whilst advice was obtained. Nate was later found laid on his bed, blue in colour and unresponsive with the [REDACTED] tight around his neck.. The [REDACTED] was removed and Nate's physical observations taken with further advice being sought and observations taken prior to an ambulance being called. Nate was taken to hospital and pronounced deceased a short time later.",During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The lack of availability of suitable placements for high risk children with complex mental health needs which is both a local and a national issue which has been ongoing for a number of years. 6

Their evidence was that an ambulance arrived to carry out a welfare check the following day (5 January) at around 1pm. They were told that the reason for the delay was confusion between Surrey Police and the Metropolitan Police.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Russell Ian Irvine died three days after his entry into HMP Durham on 4 November 2022 following his licence recall into custody, about which he protested and told reception healthcare staff that he had refused food and fluids for the previous two days. The evidence demonstrated that this information was not escalated in accordance with established policy which meant that Mr Irvine's food and fluid intake was not adequately or at all monitored by prison wing staff. As to food and fluid monitoring generally and notwithstanding the availability of internal policies mandating necessary action in cases of known food and fluid refusal, evidence from prison officers at inquest was to the effect that no formal policy existed to monitor and identify whether a prisoner had collected their meal and so had necessary sustenance at least available to them. The absence of such policy was identified by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman during its investigation as to the circumstances of Mr Irvine's death and this formed a recommendation within the Ombudsman's report. HMP Durham's response to this recommendation was the introduction of process and form to record instances when a prisoner failed to collect their meal as a means of monitoring their intake. Evidence from a prisoner Governor was to the effect that she was not aware that such a process or form was in use at any other establishment within the nationwide secure estate, enquiries having been made to substantiate this. The concern is that other such establishments operate without the advantage of the safeguard now employed at HMP Durham with the risk of future deaths occurring elsewhere evident. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 th July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:- Gemima died as the result of a suspension hanging, but there is insufficient evidence to show that at all material times she intended her death, due to impulsivity associated with her diagnosed mental illness, and the intoxicating effect of [REDACTED]. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Suspension Hanging","Gemima Christodoulou-Peace was declared deceased on Monday 31st July 2023 at, [REDACTED] in Suffolk. Gemima had been found inside the premises, suspended by her neck from a ligature. A subsequent post-mortem examination identified marks on Gemima's neck consistent with death by suspension by a ligature. Police investigations of digital media evidence identified on a balance of probabilities, that Gemima died on, or about the 26th July 2023. Gemima was known to suffer with her mental health (Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, anxiety, and depression), had previously taken overdoses of medication, and had previously been admitted to hospital mental health units. At the time of her death Gemima was found to have a high level of [REDACTED] in her system, which can induce feelings of detachment, confusion, altered perception of space and time, and panic attacks. In addition, in May 2023 Gemima received a repeat prescription of a drug called Montelukast, which in rare cases is known to increase suicidal behaviour. It is however not known when Gemima last took this drug, and none was found in Gemima's system at the time of her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you; the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows. – 1. Currently a treating clinician would need to undertake independent review on every prescription medication a patient is taking, to identify if any of those medications have a reported side-effect of increasing suicidal behaviour. For some medications this side-effect is very rare, so it is highly unlikely that a treating clinician could know all the medications identified as having a risk of increasing suicidal behaviour. At present there is no single reference point which a treating clinician can access, to readily and quickly identify if a patient is on a prescribed medication which is known to increase suicidal behaviour in some patients. 2. There are currently only a limited number of calls going into the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust which are being recorded. As such, should the clinician taking the call suddenly need to be absent (e.g. sudden ill health, domestic emergency, etc) and therefore cannot provide details of the call, there is no way any other treating clinician can respond to needs of that patient, or address any risks to that patient identified in that call. In addition, without a recording of calls there is no opportunity to review cases were there may be some doubt as to what a patient or clinician has said, or when a different clinician wishes to hear the patient themselves to independently assess the patients presentation, or for a Multi-Disciplinary Team to review the contents of that call. As many interactions between the NSFT and patients are telephone based, the availability of accurate recording of those conversations, and increased accessibility to them, would improve patient safety. 3. Gemima first reported a decline in her mental health in March 2023 and requested to be put back onto her previous medication. Gemima's GP could not do this without input from a prescribing mental health practitioner, so a referral to secondary Mental Health Services was made. Gemima's March request did not result in her obtaining an appointment with a prescribing mental health practitioner, at that time. Gemima reported her continuing low mood to her GP again on the 3rd July 2023, but as she had been referred to a Wellbeing Team, was told to contact NHS 111 Option 2 if she was 'in crisis'. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 On the 19th July 2023 Gemima told her GP her anxiety was 'through the roof' so an urgent referral to the Mental Health Services was made. Gemima was assessed over the telephone six days later on the 25th July 2023, and was offered crisis support which she declined, as Gemima wanted a medication review with the mental health team she had seen previously. On the 25th July 2023 a risk assessment was undertaken with Gemima, and using the RAG (Red, Amber, Green) system, Gemima was deemed to be an 'Amber', and therefore 'moderate' risk. The court heard that any case risk rated 'Red', had a target response time of 4-72 hours (if the patient was in crisis) and 7 days for other 'Red' cases. Any case risk rated 'Amber' had a target response time of 2 to 4 weeks, and any case rated 'Green' had a target response time of 28 days. All treating clinicians who gave evidence in Gemima's case said 'in an ideal world' resources would allow for much more timely interventions than those currently possible, especially those cases rated 'Red' or 'Amber'. Although Gemima herself had recognised the need to be back on her mental health medication, resource pressures meant that at the time of her death, she had still not seen a treating mental health practitioner who could prescribe her previous mental health prescription. Gemima's treatment assessment was booked for the 8th August 2023, 14 days after her tragic death. 6"
https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/anna-elliott-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2024-0386,2024-07-18,Melanie Lee,Inner North London,1. East London Foundation Trust (ELFT) 1,On 30 November 2011 an investigation was commenced into the death of Anna Vivien Elliott aged 26 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2024. The jury made a determination at inquest Anna suffered from severe and recurrent depression and took her own life. They also found that her death was contributed to by neglect.,"Anna had severe recurrent depression with psychotic features and autism spectrum disorder. During an inpatient mental health admission in June and July 2021, Anna had benefitted from ECT treatment. A further course of ECT was arrange for Anna as an outpatient but this was postponed on 22 November 2021. This had a negative effect on Anna, including a deterioration of her mental state. On 23 November 2021 Anna was detained under s.2 of the Mental Health Act due to having thoughts and plans to end her life. She was transferred to Roman Ward at the Mile End Hospital in the early hours of 24 November. In the afternoon of 24 November 2021 Anna was found with a non-fixed ligature whilst on general observations. Staff risk assessed her, placed her on intermittent 15 minute observations and put in place a safety plan which included locking Anna's bedroom to ensure she spent the day in communal areas. The safety plan meant in practical terms that she was being observed most, if not all of the time, by staff. The jury found that there was an inadequate handover from day to night shift. There were also inadequate staffing levels on the night shift across the mental health unit, including Roman Ward. One of the support workers allocated to undertake safe and supportive observations on Roman Ward left to attend two emergency calls on other wards. Her colleagues were not aware that she had left the ward. This resulted in a failure of staff to undertake Anna's observations between 9.03pm and 9.48pm and 9.48pm and 10.58pm. However, the observation record was filled out to record that the observations had been conducted. A decision was made to let Anna into her room at 9.03pm. The jury found that there was inadequate consideration given to changing her safety plan including no conversations had, no questions asked about Anna's mood and no risk assessment undertaken. Despite the planned continuation of 15 minute intermittent observations from day to night shift, the change in her safety plan meant there was a change in how Anna was to be observed during the night shift. This was inadequately appreciated, inadequately considered and not risk assessed. Anna was found in her room at 10:58pm with non-fixed ligatures made from nightwear and contraband items. She was pronounced deceased at 11:57pm. During the inquest ELFT made candid and helpful admissions.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Concern 1 There were issues with record keeping across the board. Including, a telephone call from Anna's mother reporting concerning messages was not recorded or passed on; an entry relating to a different patient was 3 recorded in Anna's records; staff were sharing log on details or not logging off from their account (also raising data protection concerns); and the written handover document was inadequate, failing to record vital information. Concern 2 The Trust's policy is very clear on what should be recorded on the safe and supportive observation charts. In addition, all of the witnesses could explain in evidence, the expectation and what good practice looks like. However, only one staff member's entries met this expectation. All of the other entries that I was taken to simply recorded Anna's location at the time of the observation. I heard evidence that observation records are audited for quality and entries raised with staff if they do not meet expectations. However, this process of auditing was in place at the time of Anna's death and the observation entries of the senior nurses responsible for that auditing were of the same poor quality. Concern 3 In Anna's case, safe ad supportive observations were missed. This is, at least, in part due to high acuity on the unit as a whole on the night of Anna's death, a support worker undertaking those observations being called away to an emergency and her colleagues reporting being unaware that she had left the ward. I heard evidence about steps that have been put in place to prevent observations being missed but the data provided by the Trust appeared to show that missed observations are rising and not decreasing. However, the data provided was out of date and the PFD witness was unable to interpret what was provided. I heard evidence about a strong focus on safety, openness and honesty following Anna's death. I am therefore unclear whether the data reflects a true rise in missed observations or whether it is the result of more honest reporting of missed observations by staff on the ground. Concern 4 In Anna's case, observation records were backfilled despite the observations not having been conducted. All of the witnesses who gave evidence had received training, were aware of a previous PFD on missed and falsified observations, could tell me the purpose and importance of the observations, knew that observations should not be falsified and knew that if observations were missed, this should be reported that to the nurse in charge. I was also provided with screenshots of training which included a message from the Chief Nurse appearing to be dated May 2024 which refer to “an increase in occasions where observation records have not been completed but records falsified to reflect that they had been done”. As the spot checks described to me only look at the quality and timings of the written observations, I am not reassured that records are not still being falsified or about how this is being identified and addressed. Concern 5 4 A safety plan had been agreed with Anna and put in place in the afternoon of 24 November 2021. This worked well and was a good example of staff thinking about Anna's safety and the best strategy in the context of least restrictive practice. However, during the night shift, that safety plan was ended without a formal (or any adequate) risk assessment taking place. In accordance with the Trust's policy, safe and supportive observation levels cannot be decreased without the input of a doctor. I remain unclear whether the same applies to other measures contained in safety plans and the PFD witness was unable to confirm the position. 6"

The book as previously indicated provides clear instructions as to how to make the piece of apparatus which appears to have been put together by Deborah and which has resulted in her ending her life.","I stated in my original report that separately I had discovered that the same publication was available directly from Amazon UK via their website. As you will be aware the law states that a Coroner has a duty to make a report, such as this report, with a view to the prevention of future deaths where as part of an investigation, evidence raises such a concern. I indicated earlier in my first Regulation 28 Report that I felt that duty had arisen in this case when I discovered the same publication that I believe was used by Deborah to provide instructions as to how to put a [REDACTED] generator together with a view to ending her life, that such a book is also freely available on the open market on Amazon.co.uk website and supplied directly by Amazon UK. I was concerned that the marketing and supply of such a book giving such clear instructions and advice as regards different methods for an individual to end one's life is of the utmost concern as is the regulation as regards the supply of such publications whose sole purpose is to provide information to those contemplating on ending their lives. I acknowledge that I have taken the unusual step here of issuing a second Regulation 28 Report to you, but this has come about as a result of fresh evidence coming into my possession which in my view triggers my duty in law to make a second report identifying a further concern.

I would refer you to the response to my first Regulation 28 Report from the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology, [REDACTED] dated 20 June 2024 where he highlighted the possible offence under the Suicide Act 1961 and also pointed me in the direction of the regulatory framework of the Online Safety Act 2023.

Having conducted my own research in the matter I wrote to the Chief Executive of Ofcom seeking clarity as regards the scope of the online safety legislation. I enclose with this Regulation 28 a copy of [REDACTED] Chief Executive of Ofcom's, response dated 16 July 2024.

There are 2 issues that are of concern to me both of which leave me with the concern that there appears to be nothing in the legislative arsenal to substantively dissuade Amazon UK from marketing this publication to members of the public and children, if supplied direct from their warehouse. Those concerns are based on: -

a. whilst there may be an offence under the Suicide Act 1961 as amended by the Coroners' and Justice Act 2009 to include a limited company the penalty for such an offence was not changed and it remains as imprisonment, and you cannot imprison a limited company;

b. Having regard to the response from Ofcom (copy attached for ease of reference), they have made it clear in paragraph 4 that where ""Amazon UK itself directly offers a product for sale via its own marketplace, that will be provider content (which is not in scope of the OSA) ..... I have additionally enclosed with this letter a copy image taken today from the Amazon website which clearly shows that Amazon UK are directly offering this particular book for sale via its own marketplace.

There therefore seems to me to be a significant gap in the legislation to stop material like this being directly marketed by an organisation, in this case by Amazon UK, utilising its own marketplace. I fully acknowledge that if Amazon were marketing this on behalf of a third party seller, then that would be covered by the online safety legislation but that does not appear to be the case here and this book is being provided directly by the Amazon UK Warehouse.

I have additionally enclosed a copy of the response that I received to my Regulation 28 Report from Amazon UK. I should point out here that I have been 1 of 4 coroners who have written to Amazon about this issue.

As previously stated is it not for a Coroner to make recommendations and I hope that you will not take offence that I have raised this issue again with your department, the sole purpose of which is to prevent future deaths and in doing so highlighting what I perceive to be a gap in the legislation in respect of which it is of course for His Majesty's Government to consider how best to address the concern, if you accept the concern raised in this letter."

The cause of death was: 1a.) Suspension The conclusion was Suicide.,"Jessica de Souza was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She suffered an acute manic episode in the summer of 2022. She was detained under section and prescribed aripiprazole. Her condition stabilised. She was discharged to the Home Treatment Team on the 10th November 2022. On the 1st December 2022 her care was transferred to the Community Mental Health Team. She was offered an appointment to see her community psychiatrist on the 19 th December 2022 but the appointment letter arrived after that date. The appointment was rescheduled for the 16 th January 2023. She suffered a family bereavement on the 16th January 2023 and rang cancelling the appointment. She was spoken to by the psychiatrist and offered a further appointment on the 30 th January 2023 when she rang saying she wasn't feeling well following her bereavement. She was not seen face to face for an assessment by either her community psychiatrist or her care coordinator. Support was not put in place by the community team following the bereavement. Her family were not given information about signs of relapse. Her prescribed medication, aripiprazole, was not effective to prevent her developing a depressive episode. She developed depression and took her own life by hanging herself at her home at [REDACTED] on the 1st February 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: i. The treating psychiatrists gave evidence that, following the acute manic episode, Jessica was prescribed aripiprazole as a maintenance prophylactic drug to control both polarities of bipolar disorder. ii. The clinicians relied on the BNF and the BMJ Best Practice Bipolar Disorder in Adults to support their decision to prescribe aripiprazole as prophylaxis for both polarities as a monotherapy. iii. Nice Guidance on Bipolar Disorder [CG185] suggests aripiprazole may be considered as a maintenance treatment to prevent relapse in bipolar disorder. iv. The BMJ refers to aripiprazole being used as a monotherapy to treat bipolar disorder, though does advise that it is more effective in preventing mania than depression. v. The court appointed psychiatric expert gave evidence that aripiprazole is not effective as a prophylaxis in relation to the depressive polarity in bipolar and that as a result Jessica was not protected from a depressive relapse. vi. The expert considered that the guidance relied on may have been misleading for the clinicians. 6"

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH 2.THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCE OFFICER OF HERTFORDSHIRE AND WEST ESSEX INTEGRATED CARE BOARD 1,On 7 August 2017 an investigation was commenced by the Senior Coroner for Hertfordshire into the death of Megan Leanne DAVISON. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard on 28th March 2018. The first inquest conclusion was quashed and a fresh investigation directed by the High Court on 17th May 2022. A second inquest was heard by me from 24th June 2024 to 10th July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: Ms Davison died by suicide in the context of personality disorder and Type 1 diabetes with disordered eating (also known as T1DE). The medical cause of death was: 1a Suspension 1b 1c II Personality Disorder and Type 1 Diabetes with Disordered Eating (also known as T1DE),"Megan Davison was found deceased at her home address on 4th August 2017, having hanged herself with the intention of ending her life. The following issues possibly made a more than minimal contribution to Ms Davison's death: (a) Ms Davison's discharge from the care of the Mental Health Trust on 1st August 2017; (b) Lack of integration between mental health and physical healthcare systems; (c) Absence of a recognised diagnosis for Type 1 Diabetes with Disordered Eating (also known as T1DE) and absence of pathways of care for T1DE and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (by way of physical and mental health protocols); (d) Lack of consolidated records and direct communication systems between different parts of the healthcare system.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (a) On a national level there is not a system which is capable of being operated in a way which will ensure proper integrated healthcare for patients with T1DE. Specifically, there is no formal diagnosis for T1DE, no treatment pathway for T1DE and no complete treatment pathway for Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), an acute clinical emergency associated with T1DE caused by deliberate omission of insulin, which should be seen as an act of self harm - there being a physical protocol, but no mental health protocol, for DKA. I heard independent evidence from , Professor of Psychiatry and Medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences at Kings College London that "" the lack of a diagnosis for T1DE has an impact because if you don't know what you are looking for and there aren't any criteria that you can screen by then it's very difficult for both patients and clinicians to understand what is wrong with them and this has hampered development of recognition and treatment pathways and building the research evidence"". (Copies of s independent expert reports for the Inquest are attached). (b) At a local level in East and North Hertfordshire there is no integrated healthcare system for patients with diabetes and eating disorder as there is in the west of the county. (c) Whilst there have been significant advances in developing shared clinical records systems across primary and secondary care since Ms Davison's death in 2017, none of the shared records systems extends to organisations which are deemed to be private providers, such as The Priory. The perception of healthcare providers such The Priory as ""private"" providers is a fallacy, because a high percentage of patients looked after by such providers are, like Ms Davison, NHS patients. I heard evidence from the Chief Medical Officer of The Priory that record sharing which includes private providers would help to prevent future deaths. 6"

Department of Health
South West London and St George's Mental Health Trust","On 12 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Judith Maike OBHOLZER. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: Judith Maike Obholzer died on 12 July 2023 at [REDACTED] from injuries caused from jumping in front of a moving train (suicide) following a significant period of worsening depressive illness for which she was receiving treatment. Delays by the Wandsworth SPA team in assessment and to being added to the waiting list for a full assessment by a Consultant, and the private psychiatrist not being able to directly access crisis support may have contributed to the death.","Mrs Obholzer took her own life by jumping in front of a moving train at [REDACTED] Train Station on 12 July 2023. From at least March 2023 Mrs Obholzer was suffering from depression and anxiety. She was receiving treatment through her GP in the form of antidepressants and had attended weekly Cognitive Behavioural Treatment (CBT) since 12 March 2023 with a private practitioner. Mrs Obholzer was referred to Wandsworth SPA team by her GP on 15 May 2023 and assessed by a triage nurse on 18 May. I found that there was a delay within the Wandsworth team following the initial triage assessment which led to a delay in Mrs Obholzer being put on the waiting list for assessment by a consultant psychiatrist, but that given the waiting times at that stage it was unclear whether or not she would have been assessed by the time of her death (as she had triaged as being a routine patient). She was not put on the waiting list for assessment by a consultant psychiatrist until 10 July. Throughout, Mrs Obholzer was experiencing thoughts of suicide and planning. Due to the deterioration in her condition and the wait for NHS care, Mrs Obholzer attended a consultation with a private consultant psychiatrist on 11 July 2023. The private consultant psychiatrist diagnosed her as suffering from severe post natal depression and presenting with significant suicidal risk. He recommended informal admission to a private hospital, but Mrs Obholzer was against this due to financial concerns. The private consultant psychiatrist planned to write to Mrs Obholzer's GP to request an urgent assessment by her local Home Treatment/Crisis resolution team, but that letter was not sent on that day for a variety of reasons. The private consultant psychiatrist gave evidence that he was not able to refer Mrs Obholzer to those teams directly. Following a post mortem examination the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Multiple Traumatic Injuries","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

1. In the course of the evidence it was confirmed that there is a significant pressure on NHS mental health services. It seems likely that there will be an increase in patients obtaining private support while waiting for NHS support (and often only being able to afford such support for a limited time and to a limited extent and doing so only while waiting for NHS support), as happened in this case. Consideration should be given to ensuring that there is sufficient clarity in processes such as referrals and crisis support where private practitioners are providing treatment as well as the NHS, ensuring sharing of information and notes where relevant and necessary and ensuring that the NHS provision is not assessed as unnecessary simply because someone has obtained private support as an interim measure.
2. In the course of the evidence the private consultant psychiatrist gave evidence that he was unable to refer patients directly to NHS provided crisis teams as a direct alternative to informal treatment at a private hospital. The evidence from the South West London and St George's Mental Health Trust was that direct referrals can be made although the evidence on the exact mechanism was unclear. In Mrs Obholzer's case, the (apparent) lack of ability of the private consultant psychiatrist to directly refer to the crisis team meant that she did not receive the community crisis support alternative to hospital admission that she required. Consideration should be given to ensuring that the pathway for urgent/crisis referrals from private practitioners to the NHS are clear to all (both for this area and throughout the country) and, if it is not already the case, to ensuring a process that allows private practitioners to arrange crisis support through the NHS directly.
3. In the course of the evidence it was confirmed that the private consultant psychiatrist was unable to send the urgent letter to Mrs Obholzer's GP in part because their details had not been provided. Consideration should be given to ensuring that all medical practitioners (private and NHS) can access GP registration details for patients and GP contact details to avoid delays where there is an urgent need to contact a person's GP.
4. In the course of the evidence it was confirmed that there is no sharing of medical notes between private practitioners and NHS providers. This (along with other factors) led to delays in a treatment plan being set by Wandsworth SPA as they had to obtain further details regarding Mrs Obholzer's CBT from Mrs Obholzer rather than being able to access the notes through a shared system. Consideration should be given to ensuring a system is in place to allow the sharing of medical information between practitioners across Trusts and also between NHS and Private providers."

The inquest concluded on 26 June 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, and the medical cause of death was 1a Hanging. The family requested that I refer to Benjamin as Ben, I will reflect that in this report.","Ben graduated from Cambridge University in Summer 2022 and started a taught research Masters in the Chemistry School at Reading University in the autumn term of 2022. From October 2022 Ben had a diagnosis of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder on a background of chronic social anxiety since the Covid pandemic. Ben's attendance fell drastically from Christmas 2022. From then on Ben missed lectures, hardly attended labs and missed deadlines repeatedly. In early 2023 he developed acute mental health issues probably triggered by the stress of managing academic work and deadlines and he reported suicidal thoughts to student welfare counsellors, his GP and NHS secondary mental health services. Ben had capacity and was adamant he did not want his parents to know about his mental health problems, or his difficulties with his studies. Ben's academic tutor and department director of academic tutoring (DDAT) were unaware of Ben's difficulties until he wrote to them in March 2023 explaining that he had severe mental health problems that were interfering with his work. They met with him twice and at the second and last meeting on 24 April 2023 proposed that he formally indefinitely suspend his studies and concentrate on his health. Ben was provided with paperwork to formally take this step. Ben's academic tutor thought that Ben was going to do it. Ben in fact did not. On 17 May 2023 Ben told a member of staff at the Student Support Centre who contacted him that he no longer wanted to suspend and would contact his academic school to produce an academic plan of action. However he did not contact his school and they did not contact him. Academic staff became aware that Ben had not suspended his studies in late June 2023. No-one from the University took any other steps to contact or check on Ben, or to ask anyone else to contact or check on him. Ben did not re-engage with any academic work but continued living in his student accommodation where he took his own life on or around 5 August 2023.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The evidence heard at the inquest touching Ben's death was specific to students on taught graduate research courses at the University of Reading, and my concerns set out below are specific to that group. I am copying this report to Universities UK as I consider there may be a wider application to comparable student groups in other universities nationally. (1) About 5 years ago, following concerns from academic staff that they were not equipped to support students with welfare issues, Reading University stripped out the pastoral care function from the academic supervisor role, leaving only 'academic advisors/tutors'. There is alternative provision made for welfare but it is not part of the tutor role and students on taught research courses do not have named pastoral tutors; (2) The nature of taught research courses (largely independent work) makes it more challenging to monitor students' engagement and identify issues at an early stage. Ben's difficulties with his academic work started after Christmas 2022 but were not addressed by the department until he raised them himself in March 2023 by which point he was at a crisis point; (3) Ben was appropriately encouraged to use University procedures such as 'exceptional circumstances' applications through to a conclusion, however there was no process for ensuring that after being offered the option to suspend his studies Ben was supported through to a conclusion of that process one way or another, and that remains the case for students in that position now; (4) There is an established process for enforced suspension of studies and the University agreed that with hindsight Ben was clearly not fit to study and should have been identified as such and put on that pathway instead of leaving it to Ben to decide and take action to suspend his studies; (5) By March 2023 Ben's department at Reading University knew that Ben was a student Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 with severe mental health concerns linked to management of his academic work, who had not taken any exam and had not completed sufficient research to file a dissertation and by late June they also knew that he had not completed paperwork to suspend his studies and yet: a. The University staff who knew this did not appear to appreciate what it meant for Ben and his continuing risk of vulnerability; and b. There was no individual who was given or took responsibility for what should happen next with regard to resolving Ben's academic situation; and c. Apart from brief further contact from the Student Support Centre re the suspension forms, no-one from the University contacted Ben between 24 April 2023 and when he took his life on or around 5 August 2023; (6) The primary responsibility to meet acute mental health needs when they arise lies with mental health care services. I acknowledge that Reading University have engaged with and are continuing to implement a lessons learned process since Ben's death. However I consider that circumstances at Reading University continue to present a risk to vulnerable graduate students on taught research courses who struggle with their work and develop mental health issues. The risk is of being overlooked until a crisis is reached, or becoming isolated, or of being left in academic limbo, as Ben was, with tragic results. 6"

He had taken [REDACTED] paracetamol tablets the day before. He was treated but continued to deteriorate. On 25th November 2023 he died at Tameside General Hospital. The inquest heard that he had incurred debts prior to his death as a consequence of the gap between his housing benefit entitlement and actual rent. This arose due to the “bedroom tax”. He had a larger property from when he had fostered children. However he had had to give up fostering and was as a consequence reliant on benefits. He was at risk of eviction at the time of his death.,During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 1 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The inquest was told that once Mr McHale was no longer able to foster he began to claim benefits including housing benefit. However the property he resided in was larger than a single occupancy property because he had previously fostered children. As a consequence he was subject to the so called “bedroom tax”. This meant that there was a gap between housing benefit and his actual rent. Therefore he rapidly went into arrears with his rent and liable to be evicted. He did not feel able to deal with the situation. He was worried about moving from his home in part because he had allowed one of his now adult foster children to continue living with him. He had allowed that because he was concerned that person would otherwise become homeless. Ultimately he took a catastrophic paracetamol overdose. 6

National Institute for Healthcare and Clinical Excellence (NICE) at 2nd Floor, 2 Redman Place, London E20 1JQ and 3. NHS England at 1",On 31st October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michelle Patricia Moore. Michelle was 42 years old. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25th June 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was a short-form conclusion of Suicide. The medical cause of death was: Ia) Compression of the neck Ib) Suspension by a ligature,"Mrs Moore had a lifelong history of anxiety and had difficulties in managing her emotions. She was unable to use distraction and de-escalation techniques taught to her by the mental health services as she was never able to 'ground herself' to fully utilise them and any de-escalation was short lived. In the 18 months prior to her death her mental health had noticeably declined. Mrs Moore herself could not identify any particular event, trigger or stressor for this when engaging with mental health professionals. Mrs Moore had first contacted her GP back in November 2019 (aged 37) as she was concerned about the menopause. There were no further recorded consultations or investigations in this regard until Mrs Moore had a consultation with the GP on the 27thJanuary 2023 when she expressed further concern about menopausal/perimenopausal symptoms. There were multiple secondary investigations concerning gastro and blood hormone tests, but these all came back as normal. The results of multiple clinical investigations did not reveal that there was anything sinister going on. Blood hormone tests were also not indicative of hormone changes to indicate menopause, but Mrs Moore was insistent as to the severity of her symptoms and so was started on HRT, which appeared to be clinically appropriate to trial to see if this alleviated her symptoms at all. Mrs Moore's underlying anxiety pre-disposed her to being very suggestive as to the potential side-effects of medication, as she would research them online and then develop these symptoms very quickly after commencement. Consequently, she was unable to tolerate the HRT (either orally or in patch form) for long enough to give the medication a sufficient trial to ascertain whether it helped alleviate her menopausal symptoms. She stopped taking HRT on the 17th April 2023 and did not re-start. Mrs Moore had multiple attendances and contacts with the GP, 111, Ambulance service, A&E departments and Secondary care between January 2023 and her death in October 2023; there were over 30 contacts, appointments and call-outs that related to physical symptoms. Between the 7th May 2023 and the 5th August 2023, Mrs Moore was under the care of the Home Treatment Team. She had a second episode of being under their care between the 26th September and her death on the 31st October 2023, and during these periods she had almost daily contact (sometimes multiple times a day) with the mental health teams. This was in addition to the contacts above. Mrs Moore had two acute voluntary admissions; one in a Step-Up setting (an alternative setting to an admission if there is no bed) and one to the Rydon Ward (an acute mental health ward). She was keen to avoid admissions in the future as she disliked the environment and those treating her appeared to agree that admissions had the potential to make Mrs Moore worse by increasing her anxiety and distress. Mrs Moore met with a consultant psychiatrist from the Community Mental Health Team on the 30th October 2023 and did not present in any way that gave immediate concern for her welfare and safety (over and above her baseline presentation). She was due to see a consultant psychiatrist from the Home Treatment Team the following day as part of a fluid discharge from one service to another. On the morning of the 31st October 2023, Mrs Moore was discovered deceased in her [REDACTED] home [REDACTED]. Whilst Mrs Moore had a long history of mental health anxiety, her mental health had declined acutely and severely in the 18 months prior to her death and there was no immediately identifiable life event (i.e. of a social, relationship or economic nature) that could account for her acute deterioration over this period. She had never before tried to harm herself to any significant extent and/or attempt to take her own life.","3 During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – There appeared to be a lack of continuity and joined-up care between those trying to treat Mrs Moore's menopausal symptoms and those trying to treat her mental health presentation and this suggested: (a) A lack of understanding and appreciation of the menopause and the effect this hormonal change and/or imbalance may have on women; and (b) A lack of understanding and appreciation of a potential link between menopause and a woman experiencing mental health decline. I referred in questioning to the recognised mental health conditions of Post Natal Depression (PND) and Post Natal Psychosis (PNP) where it appears to be more widely understood and appreciated amongst treating professionals that childbirth and the hormonal imbalance/upheaval can acutely affect a woman's mental wellbeing and state of mind. However, the same awareness and/or appreciation does not appear to exist when, later in life, a woman may suffer a mental health decline due to acute hormonal changes brought about by the menopause (whether or not this is treated with HRT). There appears to be a complete absence of national and/or local guidance or published policy (none was brought to my attention on questioning of the clinicians) concerning: (a) The potential for a link between menopause and mental health decline. (b) The need for joined-up care between those trying to treat women at this stage of their lives.

The Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I conducted on 19th June 2024. The conclusion was that Ms Stapleton died from suicide. The medical cause of death was 1 (a) lncisional Injury to Right Femoral Artery and Vein.,"These were recorded as: Isobel Stapleton, aged 32, suffered depression. She was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan hospital as a voluntary inpatient on 18th June 2022 for assessment and was reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist. She was discharged on 24th June 2022, returned to reside with her father and received treatment from the home treatment team. On Saturday 9th July 2022 Ms Stapleton was at home and appeared to give no cause for concern until her father heard her call from upstairs. He found her on the floor of her bedroom with significant bleeding [REDACTED]. He summoned help and comforted her as she lost consciousness. Paramedics were deployed at 14.49 and attended at 14.54 but her life could not be saved. It is likely that her injuries were self inflicted. Ms Stapleton expressed a clear intention to end her life in a hand written note found at the scene. The Inquest focused upon the following: The assessment and management of the risk posed by Ms Stapleton to herself. The information available to medical professionals and information sharing between professionals and agencies. The availability of psychological assessment and treatment resources to the inpatient team at the Royal Glamorgan hospital and the home treatment team covering Merthyr Tydfil. The involvement of Ms Stapleton's family in discharge planning.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. For your information the MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: ­ (1) Mental health practitioners are not easily able to access all of a patient's relevant Coroner's Office, The Old Courthouse, Courthouse Street, Pontypridd, CF37 1JW - clinical records pending the introduction of a ""Once for Wales"" solution, for which there is currently no timetable for implementation. (2) Mental health practitioners may not be aware of the existence of all such records, some of which may be in paper. (3) Mental health practitioners in Wales currently have no way easily to access NHS England clinical records. (4) The inpatient hospital team at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital did and does not have access to a clinical psychologist to provide direct assessment and treatment of a patient. (5) The Home treatment team covering Merthyr Tydfil does not have access to a clinical psychologist to provide direct assessment and treatment of a patient.

On 5th June 2024 I concluded the inquest into Mr McCarlie's death. The conclusion of that inquest was a narrative conclusion: Liam Paul McCarlie died by suicide. From 15 February 2023 there was an insufficiently clear plan to support proactively Mr McCarlie's mental health whilst he waited for formal assessment for suitability for the Structured Clinical Management programme. This possibly contributed to his death. On 1 April 2023 there was a significant delay in an ambulance attending upon Mr McCarlie following an emergency call. This delay was caused by an increased demand on the ambulance service. This delay contributed to Mr McCarlie's death. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging,"At around 23.23 on 1st April 2023 Liam Paul McCarlie was found by paramedics suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Mr McCarlie was not breathing, had no pulse and had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3/15. His heart rhythm was asystole. Earlier that evening he had exchanged text messages in which he had expressed an intention to take his own life. At around 17.52 his father and step-mother contacted the ambulance service. The call was assessed as requiring a 120 minute 90th centile response time. Paramedic led Double Crewed Ambulances had been allocated at 20.29 and 22.08 however both were stood down and reallocated to attend higher priority calls. At the time, the local ambulance service was experiencing a prolonged and significant increase in calls resulting in delays: a critical safety plan was in operation. A third paramedic led Double Crewed Ambulance was allocated at 22.50. That ambulance arrived [REDACTED] at 23.11, i.e. 5 hours and 19 minutes after the initial call and therefore significantly outside of the 90th centile for a call of this kind. Had the ambulance service arrived within the required response time, it would have done so at a time when Mr McCarlie was still alive. The last recorded call from Mr McCarlie was at 19.26 (a call lasting 2 minutes). The last recorded text message was sent by Mr McCarlie at 20.18. Death was confirmed at 00.33 on 2nd April 2023. In early February 2023 Mr McCarlie's mental health deteriorated significantly. He was assessed by various mental health professionals, including a consultant psychiatrist. Mr McCarlie had previously attempted suicide in July 2021; following this he took anti- depressant medication until February or March 2023. On 15th February 2023 Mr McCarlie was identified as presenting with traits which were highly indicative of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. He was referred to the Structured Clinical Management (“SCM”) programme. At the time of his death Mr McCarlie had not been formally assessed for suitability within the SCM programme.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – During the inquest I heard evidence from the Senior Quality Manager for Coroner Services at the East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust (“EMAS”). She explained that some Integrated Care Boards had introduced a scheme whereby a mental health nurse would accompany a paramedic in a car and in appropriate cases would be dispatched to a patient for the purposes of meeting both their physical and mental health needs. The NHS Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board (“the Northamptonshire ICB”) did not adopt this scheme. Instead, the Northamptonshire ICB have introduced a mental health nurse located within the Emergency Operations Centres (“the EOC”) for the purpose of providing advice and, in appropriate cases, despatch from the EOC. I was told that members of EMAS have access to General Practitioner records held on SystmOne. EMAS does not have access to mental health records. In respect of Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire those records are held on a system called RiO. In respect of Northamptonshire and Derbyshire those records are held on SystmOne. I was told that there was no technical reason why EMAS staff (especially the mental health nurse located in the EOS) could not access a patient's mental health records if held on SystmOne. There are such technical reasons why EMAS staff do not have access to RiO (an entirely different database). A data sharing agreement is likely to be needed as may a particular patient's consent. I am concerned that notwithstanding the recognition of the desirability for specialist mental health input, those mental health professionals within the EOC do not presently have access to records which may have been produced by the community mental health team. That is notwithstanding that the principal database used by the provider of community mental health treatment in Northamptonshire (the Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust) is one to which EMAS does presently have access. Such information may be relevant to, for example, whether the patient has a history of suicidal ideation or attempts. That information may in turn be material to the triage and dispatch of ambulance resources. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 June 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide,"On the morning of 28 June 2023 Thomas Joseph Geraghty entered the sea from the beach at Eastbourne. He was not witnessed entering the water. At around 11:45, Mr Geraghty's body was seen floating by a nearby lifeguard and he was recovered to the beach. Resuscitation was attempted however it was sadly unsuccessful and death was confirmed.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Mr Geraghty had been prescribed anti-psychotic medication since 2007, which he took on a daily basis. His symptoms responded well to the medication and his mental health was assessed in 2015 as stable. Mr Geraghty informed his family that he felt safe taking his medication and had intended to remain on it for life. In January 2021, Mr Geraghty's GP surgery noted that he had moved out of its catchment area and a letter was sent to him advising him to register with a new surgery closer to his new home address. Mr Geraghty does not appear to have registered with a new surgery and remained a patient of his original surgery. He continued to receive a repeat prescription for his anti-psychotic medication and received his COVID vaccinations and also text messages from the surgery relating to smoking cessation advice up to November 2021. On 4 May 2022, the surgery sent Mr Geraghty a text message to confirm that they were still prescribing his medication and that he needed to provide his new surgery details. No details were provided by Mr Geraghty and he continued to be prescribed his anti-psychotic medication with the last prescription, a two-month supply, issued on 10 November 2022. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Mr Geraghty requested a repeat prescription via his usual automated service on 12 January 2023. Mr Geraghty appears to have been deregistered as a patient by the surgery on 16 January 2023 and there does not appear to have been any communication with Mr Geraghty at this time to inform him of the deregistration. Two chaser emails were sent to the surgery by the pharmacy to seek authorisation for the prescription but no response was received and Mr Geraghty, who had not yet registered with another surgery went without his anti-psychotic medication. He was not on any medication at the time of his death and family noted that some of his psychotic symptoms had returned in June 2023. I have a concern that individuals can be removed from the surgery as patients without any scrutiny as to whether the individual may be receiving vital medication (either for a mental health or physical health issue). There does not appear to be any process of review in relation to these patients to ensure that they will continue to receive their medication after they are deregistred from the surgery. This is of particular concern where a patient is deregistered and the surgery has not been provided with details of an individual's new GP. There is a concern that in these circumstances, an individual may be left without access to medication, which could cause or contribute to their death. 6"

The investigation concluded on the 22nd May2024 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) hanging.,"Lee Ann Sarah Ince was a victim of domestic abuse, who was in a coercive and controlling relationship. The prolonged exposure to domestic abuse during the relationship had a significant impact on her mental health. On 9th May 2023 she was found unresponsive attached to a ligature.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The inquest heard evidence that agencies involved in supporting her in the months leading up to her death had a limited understanding of how behaviours could be twisted in a coercive and controlling relationship to make it appear as if the victim was part of the problem. In this situation it was clear that Lee-Ann was the victim of so called “love bombing” which meant that she was barraged with messages from the perpetrator. The impact of that on a victim's mental health was not recognised. 1 Her children had expressed their concerns to their school. The school had been proactive in sharing those concerns but there was little evidence that other agencies were then listening to “the voice of the child”. This meant that agencies who had direct contact with her did not have a full grasp of the situation or her vulnerability. The inquest was told that if information is not effectively shared and the voice of the child is lost there is an increased risk to the victim. A feature of her vulnerability was her physical health and how dependent she was, as a consequence, on the perpetrator to help care for her. The additional vulnerability and impact of this was not recognised by agencies involved in supporting her. The inquest was told that where vulnerability is not properly understood the risk presented to a victim of domestic abuse increases. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 03 June 2024. The Conclusion of the Inquest was that: The Deceased intentionally took her own life following a deterioration in her mental health which was exacerbated by the actions of her employer.,"The Deceased, a serving Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) Sergeant, had worked for the MPS for over twenty-two and a half years mostly as a front-line officer; in early 2020, she had joined the Learning and Development Team at Hendon as a Public & Personal Safety Instructor Sergeant, which was a job she loved. She had struggled with mental and physical health issues for several years, including work-related PTSD, but had found counselling helpful for dealing with this. Her mental health declined from autumn 2021 when she found herself under increasing pressure at work and lost access to counselling. An Occupational Health Referral was discussed with her line manager but was not progressed until 23 May 2022 when, because her health had impacted on her ability to lead and supervise her Team, she was also issued with informal management action. Although she was always open about her mental health issues, line management decisions made in respect of her reflected a focus on managing upwards and were supported by the Senior Leadership Team; these decisions were at the expense of the Deceased ' s personal and occupational welfare and contributed to a further significant deterioration in her mental health. Despite the intervention of the Deceased ' s local mental health Crisis Team, who provided her with out-patient care from 21 September 2022, on the morning of 28 September 2022, she was found hanging by a ligature made from her dressing gown belt attached to the landing banisters at her home. Emergency Services attended but her death was confirmed by paramedics at 10.56 hours. She had last been heard from at around 01.00 hours that morning when she had sent a text message to her partner saying that her sleeping medication was not working.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Although I was informed during the Inquest process about various changes that have been made to MPS Employment Policy and Processes since Nikki's death, including the introduction of a new 'Raising Concerns' Policy in May 2023, I believe there remains evidence of a culture of poor management and institutional defensiveness, as highlighted in the Baroness Casey Review, which these changes do not address. There is no point in encouraging concerns to be raised whilst this culture persists. My investiation into Nikki's death revealed clear evidence of officers, particularly the more junior ranking officers, having a fear of speaking out about their management and also an unwillingness, by the L&D Senior Management Team, to listen independently to the concerns raised. Furthermore the PSU (as well as the DPS investigation after Nikki's death and your representation at the Inquest) appeared only to seek to support the role of senior management; even though the Inquest found that aspects of Nikki's management had been seriously deficient and had contributed to her death. This appeared to me to confirm the criticism made by Baroness Casey that the MPS “starts from a position that nothing wrong has occurred” and their “systems support wrongdoers”. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide,"On 02/10/2023, Shelley was reported missing by a friend. Following concerns for Shelley's welfare, police forced entry to her home at 23:45 where she was sadly found deceased, and she had clearly been deceased for some time. Post mortem and toxicological analysis confirmed that she died as a result of intentional consumption of [REDACTED] which she had purchased off the internet. Shelley had been spoken to by police on 03/09/2023 about the reasons for the purchase and she had reassured them as to its use. She had a history of poor mental health and was under the care of the community mental health team at the time of her death. Shelley had missed her planned monthly depot injection on 18/09/23 and the mental health team were trying to locate her. There was a missed opportunity by the police to force entry to her home on 27/09/2023, but it is not possible to say whether she would have been found alive at that time. Following a post mortem, the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a [REDACTED] poisoning","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Matter 1 1. I heard evidence that there was a 6-day delay in the Community Mental Health Team team making a referral to the Home Treatment Team which was put down ""clinical pressures"". Upon discussion, these ""clinical pressures"" related to staffing levels and the evidence was that at the time the team was meant to have 7 clinical members of staff but only had 3. I was told that matters have improved somewhat and that now there is sufficient staffing levels. 2. However, it was confirmed that gaps in staffing levels do occur which can have a knock-on effect of causing issues with service delivery and care for patients. 3. It is not difficult to foresee that inadequate staffing levels will give rise to missed opportunities for patients to be assessed; for interventions to take place; and for treatments to be given - particularly where patients may choose to disengage with services but who do not demonstrate any ""red flags"" or early warnings, as was the case with Shelley. 4. As such, I am concerned about the risk of future deaths occurring if staffing issues arise in the future. Matter 2 1. I heard evidence from the Structured Judgment Review that a learning point was identified that early warning signs were not completed to the required expectation or standard. 2. As such, an Action Plan was prepared and a task was agreed that this would be discussed at the Trust Risk and Task Finishing Group to establish clear clinical standards, with the same then being disseminated within the Trust. This was allocated to the Clinical Service Manager for ICCR and was due to be completed by May 2024. 3. In evidence, it was confirmed that target had been missed due to a meeting being cancelled, but assurance was offered that it would take place in July - after the inquest has concluded. 4. I am concerned that if this target is pushed back and/or is not met, for whatever reason, there is a risk that future deaths will occur. Upon conclusion of the inquest, I am Functus Officio, with no power to request updates from the Trust to check and ensure that targets have been met and changes have been made. Whilst I am grateful for the efforts of reassurance provided by representatives of the Trust at the inquest, I am reluctant to dismiss my concerns, particularly where actions remain outstanding, and I have opportunity to take action now to ensure that the risk of future deaths is reduced. It is for you and your organisation to take the action that is required to resolve the issues and to prevent future patients from dying avoidable deaths. It is not for me as Coroner to make recommendations on how you do that, therefore I leave matters in your hands. 6"

The Jury's conclusion of the inquest was 1a Multiple Traumatic Injuries with a Narrative: Aaron James Deeley came to his death by suicide contributed to by neglect on the 14th January 2022 at 01:58.We accept the admissions made by Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust (MSE) as attached. However, in addition we consider probable, causative factors as follows; MSE had ample opportunities to make good or replace the windows, as the issues were first reported in April 2019 but had failed to do so by the time of Aarons' death. Notwithstanding a Section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DOLS) and Mental Capacity Act paperwork being in place, the security one to one (1:1) was removed, failing to meet Aarons' requirements for ongoing 1:1 supervision at circa 21:00 on 13/01/2022. In addition, we consider the following possible causative factors as follows; Insufficient administration and inadequate record keeping, incidents of these failures include: Inconsistencies in completion of the ward Enhanced Observation Form on 13/01/2022, Following Aarons' first suicide attempt the discharge paperwork of the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) assessment on 02/12/2021 was sent to the wrong GP address, Discharge paperwork from Southend Hospital on 02/12/2021 was lacking sufficient detail of the intent and the overdose medication, Insufficient minutes recorded from the Essex University Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) on 21/12/2021, to understand the decision to decline the referral of Aaron to the First Response Team, On-going COVID restrictions impacting staffing and working environment during November 2021 to January 2022, Conflicting understanding of the policy regarding the intervention of the MHLT for patients on the Acute Medical Unit (AMU) ward.","Following several known suicide attempts, over the period November 2021 and January 2022, failings in the care and safeguarding provided by Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust contributed to Aaron James Deeley being able to take his own life. On the 14th January 2022 at around 01:26 Aaron James Deeley took deliberate action to exit from the defective 2nd floor window next to his bed on Acute Medical Unit 1 ward at Southend Hospital. Landing on the ground below, Aaron sustained multiple traumatic injuries resulting in his death at 01:58.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – While a patient is admitted to an acute Trust ward for treatment for physical health treatment and is being held under section 5 (2) Mental Health Act for a Mental Health Act assessment due to concerns the patient presents a risk to themselves or others with a mental disorder, it permits the patient to be held for a maximum period of 72 hours. a. Patients admitted into the Accident & Emergency department detained under various sections of the Mental Health Act have a Responsible Clinician allocated. Patients who are not under section have access to the Mental Health Liaison Team. b. Patients admitted onto a ward at the acute Trust detained under various sections of the Mental Health Act have an allocated Responsible Clinician. As section 5 (2) is a holding power only, there is no 2 Responsible Clinician allocated for a vulnerable patient being held pending assessment for consideration for detention under the Mental health Act. c. During the waiting period of up to 72 hours, Mental Health Liaison will not attend the acute ward or make assessment of the presenting risks of self-harm. d. The acute care healthcare professionals do not have specialist mental health training to conduct a mental health assessment and the consequential presenting harm. e. There was confusion at the acute Trust as to what regime was required to ensure that a patient awaiting Mental Health Act assessment could be put under 1:1 observation. The Trust policy was confusing and did not cover patients like Aaron Deeley. f. There is no joint protocol to cover the working between the two Trusts on this issue as the referral for Mental Health Act assessment goes outside of both organisations. There is a lacuna for patients awaiting Mental Health Act assessment and requiring simultaneous physical healthcare when a significant risk has been identified such that a patient may require detention for their own safety. 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a multiple injuries including complete disruption of the torso and skull fracture. .","Jacob was in long term foster care. Following his 18th birthday he was under the pathways leaving care team. He was subject to an education, health and care plan and was still receiving support from William Henry Smith School and received therapy sessions from them. He was seen by a pathways advisor and had an independent visitor in place. In May and June 2023 professionals meetings concerns were expressed about his low mood and he was encouraged to attend his GP with his foster carer. The GP report confirms there was no low moods or anxiety reports apart from the 24 November 2023 appointment that he attended with his foster carer where treatment was discussed and he wanted to think about his options. His foster carer contacted the local authority in September 2023 after he had told her his feelings had gone downhill and she was not given any strategies to help him. The independent visitor discussed his wellbeing with him on 3 December 2023 where he said he had felt suicidal in the past but did not currently feel this way. This information was not passed on to his foster carer or to the pathways team. He was seen again on 31 December 2023 where he was reported to be doing well and no concerns were raised about his emotional wellbeing. On new years day Jacob left home and mentioned about having choices to his foster carer. He did not say where he was going and did not return home. On 1 January 2024 Jacob made his way onto the train tracks at Heeley Loop in Sheffield. He was seen on the track in the four foot area. [REDACTED] It was dark and raining heavily that evening. The train driver applied the emergency brake. Jacob made no attempt to move. There was no time to sound the horn. Unfortunately the train was unable to stop in time and impacted with Jacob causing fatal injuries. Investigations were undertaken that could not establish how Jacob had accessed the train lines. In that area I heard there is more than standard security, with fences and walls. There is pedestrian access and vehicle access gates, but these were locked and everything was in order.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Whilst the Independent Visitor was made aware of previous suicidal ideation this was not passed on to the foster carer or anyone else. Calderdale were unable to tell me of the training they receive or the escalation route for concerns or disclosures of this type. There is a clear risk that if this type of information is not passed on and adequate training is not provided in terms of metal health then this could cause future deaths. 6

Amina was ready for step-down in September 2022, but was subject to a prolonged stay on the PICU ward due to the shortage of appropriate, specialist care beds. Amina's mental health deteriorated during her long PICU stay. These factors contributed to the circumstances of Amina's death.","Amina lived in Birmingham.

Other than her brief time at The Priory Hospital, Woodbourne all of Amina's placements were out-of-area. Amina was ready for step-down from the PICU, at The Priory Cheadle, in early September 2022. Nield House would not re-admit Amina without a further assessment, and in any event, had Amina then been accepted FTB would have needed to re-apply to the ICB for funding of her placement at Nield House. FTB decided to carry out a PACT assessment to re-determine Amina's needs in order to ensure that the next placement would be the most appropriate. Failure of another rehabilitation placement would be devastating for Amina. That assessment was commenced in October 2022 and was complete by early January 2023. There was consideration of Fern Unit, a specialist Personality Disorder Unit at Priory Cheadle but it was felt that its DBT programme was too rigid for Amina's needs. Following completion of the assessment FTB sought a suitable rehabilitation placement. At the time only two independent providers had capacity to take Amina. One of those, Cygnet Alders Ward turned Amina down as it did not think Amina was sufficiently stable. The other one, Equilibrium Eleanor House in Manchester. was prepared to accept Amina after carrying out its own assessment. On 15.03.23 the FTB applied to the ICB for funding to transfer Amina to Eleanor House, which at the time had voluntarily closed itself to patients following a CQC rating of overall inadequate, and was appealing a Notice of Decision, to be heard in June 2023. The application was turned down by the ICB on 04.05.23 . The ICB provided the FTB with 3 other potential placements, Cygnet Kewstoke: Weston-Super-Mare Elysium Gateway: Widnes Priory Middleton St George: Durham. None of these units were prepared to consider Amina because of the acuity of their current patients. Upon being told that funding for Eleanor House had been declined there was a significant downturn in Amina's mental stability evidenced by a re-emergence of ligaturing as a coping mechanism, and for the following 10 weeks was monitored on enhanced level observations. By mid-July Amina had stabilised. During that period the option of transferring Amina to a local PICU, with input from the local mental health in-reach team was explored, but there were no local PICU female beds available. There being only 6 such beds locally, commissioned exclusively by FTB at The Priory, Barnt Green. In July 2023 The Priory (the treating team) and FTB (the home team) and Amina felt that she was stuck. Further consideration was given to Fern Unit. Following assessment, and with some flexibility introduced into the DBT programme, Amina was accepted by Fern Unit on 31.08.23 . At a Ward Round on 06.09.23 both the Pankhurst Ward team and FTB felt that the transfer would be appropriate. Amima was noted to be looking forwards to the move. A peer from Pankhurst Ward had already been transferred. Although a bed was immediately available FTB needed to complete an application for funding the Fern Unit to the ICB. That had not been commenced at the time of Amina's death but had it been it is unlikely, even if commenced on 06.09, that funding would have been approved in time to allow transfer before her death. The evidence of the Responsible Clinician at The Priory, Cheadle and the Court appointed expert was that there was an overall deterioration in Amina's mental health during her prolonged admission on the PICU; it was not an appropriate environment, she was not able to have the necessary therapy, although Amina received psychological input it was limited (by the fact of being in PICU) and by July/August Amina had stopped learning and was not using coping mechanisms that she had developed in her psychology sessions.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – This is now the third inquest (two within the past 8 months) I have heard where the delayed transfer of an out-of-area patient from an independent provider's hospital has been a contributory factor in that patient's death. Two of those cases involving prolonged stays on PICU units; in this case some 13 months and in the other, some 11 months. These cases illustrate, a) Underfunding for local mental health beds. It took some 6 weeks in 2022 to transfer Amina from the PD specialist placement at Nield House (where the treating team felt that they could not keep Amina safe) to a PICU some 90 miles from home. Further, there were no local PICU beds available for transfer out of The Priory, Cheadle in May/June/July 2023 when a PD placement could not be found. b) An over-reliance by the NHS on independent providers for mental health beds whether general acute beds, PICU beds or specialist units. c) A national scarcity of specialist PD rehabilitation units The inquest heard evidence from treating two treating psychiatrists in Amina's 3 history (Nield House and The Priory), FTB PACT assessor, and the court appointed independent expert that there was, and is, a national shortage of specialist PD rehabilitation units/beds, paraphrasing, 'rehabilitation beds for female patients with PD are limited – demand exceeding what is available nationally'. 'shortage of rehabilitation placements nationally – impeding on young persons' mental health treatments' 'simply not enough beds (NHS or Independent) to cater for such complex patients as Amina – transfers not being accepted by such units even if not full because the acuity of their existing patients'. 'PD rehabilitation beds are scarce – spread nationally often in isolated units far from home, family and the local/home team. Each having its own admission criteria/exclusions, such as the possible need for NGT feeding'. Following the PACT assessment FTB, in early 2023, were only able to find two PD units that had a bed available. One of them, Eleanor House, was re-opening its doors having voluntarily closed at the end of 2022. It had 14 beds available. However, its extant CQC rating was overall inadequate and it was in the process of appealing a Notice of Decision. The other, Cygnet Alders, declined the referral. Three other units were identified as possibilities but each declined a referral, without any assessment, based on the acuity of their own patients. Just 5 beds available over a period 6-7months, before Fern Unit accepted Amina. In the meantime Amina remained in a PICU, some 90 miles from home which was wholly unsuited to her presentation and unable (through no fault of its own) to deliver the care and therapy that she needed resulting in a deterioration in her mental state with increasing risks/incidents of self-harm. d) A funding process for rehabilitation units that is not fit for purpose. The inquest heard evidence about the funding set-up for secondary mental health care in the Birmingham area, which is replicated nationally. The ICB commissioned FTB to provide secondary mental health services, both community and in-patient. FTB are able to commission NHS and independent sector acute beds and PICU's, both in and out of area. However, FTB are not able to commission specialist placement, including PD units. These are commissioned/funded directly by the ICB upon application by the FTB; having found a unit that would accept a patient. This system, for funding specialist/rehabilitation beds, is inadequate; particularly in light of the shortage of such specialist/rehabilitation beds. The inquest heard evidence that the process from application to funding approval takes weeks, sometimes months. In this case it took from 13.03.23 to 04.05.23 for a negative outcome. The shortage of beds/units means that when a bed becomes available there are a number of patients in competition for it. The beds are not kept open for any particular patient and, in essence, allocation becomes a race on funding. It is surprising that a 'home team' (in this case FTB) commissioned by an ICB to provide secondary mental health services is not permitted to make its own funding decisions for specialist units, as it can for acute wards and PICU's. As can be seen from the evidence Amina was able to be transferred within 24hrs once a PICU accepted her on 01.08.23, albeit it took a wholly unsatisfactory 6 weeks to find a PICU bed."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on. The conclusion of the inquest was that: The cause of death was established as: I a Hanging by Ligature,"Mr Larsen was a 52 year old white male who, on 6 January 2023, was found hanging at his home in Leicestershire.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 Pre-amble Mr Larsen was a 52 year old male with no history of mental health problems until he presented to his GP in November 2022 to discuss a decline in his Mental Health. Mr Larsen reported going through a very difficult time, his business was being liquidated and he felt he had let his family and business associates down. Mr Larsen advised the GP that he had placed a bag over his head a few days before the consultation but stopped short of seeing his attempt to end his life through because he thought about his children who were a protective factor for him. Mr Larsen's GP referred him to the CRISIS Home Resolution Treatment Team, part of the Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust, who accepted him for a period of treatment. Mr Larsen was seen regularly by the team and commenced on medication. Mr Larsen was discharged from the CRISIS Home Resolution Treatment Team on 3 December 2022. On 4 January 2023 Mr Larsen contacted the CRISIS Home Resolution Treatment Team and reported a return of suicidal thoughts, he said that he felt he needed medication, counselling and mental health support. Mr Larsen agreed to be contacted by a Mental Health Practitioner from the Mental Health Central Access Point for the purposes of carrying out a triage. On 5 January 2023, in the evening, a Nurse from the Mental Health Central Access Point contacted Mr Larsen to carry out a Safe and Well Call. During the call Mr Larsen confirmed that he was ok and agreed for the triage appointment to be carried out on 6 January 2023, confirming that he would be able to keep himself safe until then. It was accepted during the inquest by the Nurse who undertook this safe and well call that she had not read Mr Larsen's medical records or his referral document before making the safe and well call and therefore she was not aware of the risks relating to Mr Larsen when she made the call. On 6 January 2023 Mr Larsen was found hanging at home by his wife, he died before the planned triage call could take place. Concerns 1. Multi-Disciplinary Team (“MDT”) Meetings I am concerned about the Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust MDT meetings and their functionality. Mr Larsen was discussed at three meetings, at two of the three meetings none of the attendees had met Mr Larsen. It was at an MDT meeting where Mr Larsen was deemed to be “low risk” (having initially been deemed to be high risk by the Central Access Point), it is not possible to understand why Mr Larsen's risk was downgraded to low risk by the MDT meeting because the MDT meeting documentation does not contain that information. The issue of poor documentation relating to MDT meetings and their decision making is something which could have ramifications across the whole Trust and also for other bodies who come together to provide care for patients. The MDT meeting either misread or misunderstood Mr Larsen's medical records. The notes document that Mr Larsen explained that he had previously placed a bag over his head and that this remained the way he would end his life, he advised that he could not give assurances that he would not try to do this again. The MDT documentation however states that Mr Larsen “wrapped plastic bag over his face but self-rescued, does not want to do it again”. This is incorrect. The MDT meeting therefore proceeded, and made decisions based upon, incorrect information. There were several requests made to MDT meetings for Mr Larsen to have a medic review, the MDT Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 deemed this to be unnecessary but there is no documentation explaining the rationale of those decision. The Trust SI report states that “it is unfortunate that he was not reviewed by a medic.” At the second MDT meeting on 17th November the working diagnosis in relation to Mr Larsen was an acute stress reaction. This working diagnosis was not revisited at the third MDT on 22nd November. The Trust's SI report states that by 17th November there was evidence of a severe depressive disorder, this potential diagnosis was not identified or explored by the MDT meeting. 2. Risk assessments At his initial triage (undertaken by the Central Access Point) Mr Larsen was deemed to be high risk. At a later MDT meeting Mr Larsen was deemed to be low risk. It is not possible to explore the rationale behind the downgrading of Mr Larsen's risk to low because there is no documentation about the decision making. The Trust's SI report identified the fact that several “red flag” risk factors which applied to Mr Larsen were not “robustly considered” when assessing Mr Larsen's risk. The Trust's SI report states that it was “unclear why it was felt the risks had subsided by the time of discharge on 3.12.2022”. 3. Discharge Mr Larsen was discharged from the care of LPT on 3 December 2022, there was no planned support for Mr Larsen post-discharge other than some counselling which was due to start three weeks later. The Trust's SI report states that it is “unclear why it was felt the risks had subsided by the time of discharge on 3.12.2022” and that Mr Larsen had the “presence of ample markers for high risk of completed suicide” yet he was discharged back to the care of his GP and into a lacuna of care with no pre-arranged support other than counselling which would not commence for three weeks. 4. The Serious Investigation and Reporting Process at LPT I remain concerned about inadequacies in the Serious Incident Investigation and Reporting processes at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust. The Serious Incident Investigation into Mr Larsen's death did uncover and accepted some failings in relation to the care provided to Mr Larsen. However, it failed to uncover all the matters arising at inquest and, some of the matters that it did uncover do not have correlating items of work listed in the action plan. There was no exploration of the MDT meeting's functionality or documentation as part of the SI investigation. Further, I have concerns about the implementation and embedding of the lessons learned which are identified by the SI Report. In this case the live witnesses who gave evidence during the course of the inquest did not demonstrate that learning had filtered down to the front-line staff. I am therefore concerned that the SI process at LPT does not support a robust and critical analysis and investigation of the care provided to patients, further, I have concerns about the ability of the Trust to embed changes and learning. This failure to properly explore matters and learn where possible inevitably leads to a delay, or failure altogether, to learn lessons which are vital to patient safety across the whole Trust.

Sailor was non-binary and chose to be referred to by the pronouns “they / them”. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 June 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that Sailor took their life by suicide. At the time of their death, Sailor was on the waiting list for treatment under the Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, which is operated by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (“CAMHS”).","Sailor was first referred to the CAMHS in October 2020 aged 13 due to low mood and self-harm. The referral was accepted in November 2020. Sailor was advised that the waiting time for the mental health assessment appointment would approximately one year, in November 2021. In fact, after an episode of self-harm in mid 2021 and the intervention of the CAMHS crisis team, the assessment due to take place in around November 2021 was superseded by an earlier assessment in mid 2021, and on 20 August 2021 Sailor and their parents were advised that Sailor had been added to the list for and treatment which at that time was approximately 10 months. Sailor took their life some four weeks later on 17 September 2021 when they were found deceased in their bedroom at home by their parents.

(2) The length of time before treatment could be delivered thereafter (approximately 10 months) was unacceptably long. (3) The Court heard evidence that the waiting times for assessment and treatment have not improved since Sailor's death, and in fact both have significantly increased. This means that a teenager referred today into the CAMHS could be waiting for around / upwards of two years before they receive treatment. This is an unacceptably long delay. (4) The Court heard evidence that the Trust is attempting to mitigate the problem by way of a proactive “Keeping in Touch” team with the potential to streamline / re- organise the waiting list. However, due to the number of individuals on the waiting list (estimated to be over 1,000) and the number of staff engaged in the Keeping in Touch team (three) and the scale of the task, I was not re-assured that the Keeping in Touch team could realistically and / or safely assess or re-prioritise those on the waiting list in most urgent need of assessment or treatment.

Association of Police and Crime Commissioners: , Chief Executive 1",On 05/10/23 I commenced an investigation into the death of Tcherno Bari. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21/05/24.,"On 18/09/23 Mr Bari was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 and admitted to a psychiatric unit at George Ward, Highcroft Hospital. He was diagnosed with psychotic depression. Mr Bari's suicide risk factors included: (1) recent suicide attempts and ideation [REDACTED], (2) recent breakdown of relationship, (3) paranoid command delusions (being controlled by a chip in his head) and hallucinations (hearing two different voices making derogatory comments), (4) severe depression, and (5) cessation of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medication (as recent as 24/09 and 25/09). On 25/09/23 he violently (which was a further suicide risk factor in that it amounted to a change in behavior) forced his way through two secure doors and left the grounds. The Responsible Clinician (a senior Consultant Psychiatrist) prescribed an urgent intravenous tranquillizer, but nurses were not in a position to restrain Mr Bari. The Responsible Clinician was of the view Mr Bari was presenting with psychotic depression with florid command hallucinations and active paranoid delusions and considered him to be at high-risk of suicide. The police were called promptly and searched the local area for around 1 ½ hours. He was found deceased 23 hours later, on the next day 26/09, hanging from a tree in parkland outside the police search area. The Nurse-in-Charge reported (relying only on her memory) some, but not all, of his suicidal risk factors during the 999 call. The call taker did not fully record this detail on the control log and the attending Constable was unaware. The Nurse-in-Charge (relying only on her memory) did not repeat this detail to the attending Constable and did not complete 'appendix C – risk rating' or hand it to the Constable (as required by the BSMHFT Missing Patient Policy) which would have amplified some, but not all, of his suicide risk factors. There was a conflict between the Nurse-in-Charge (an experienced and senior mental health nurse) and the police Constable (who was relatively inexperienced). The Nurse-in-Charge indicated Mr Bari was at high-risk of suicide. The Constable felt the Nurse-in-Charge could not rationalise the high-risk category, and decided Tcherno was at medium-risk of suicide (having in her view followed College of Policing: Missing Person Authorised Professional Practice). The medium-risk category was accepted by the Sergeant and Inspector, and later accepted by WMP's Locate team, taking the Constable's report about the facts at face value. The fact the police had taken a different view about the level of risk was not explained to George Ward, and neither the Nurse-in- Charge, Responsible Clinician, or Clinical Service Manager were aware. The Clinical Service Manager (as required by the BSMHFT Missing Patient Policy) did not 'immediately' (or at all) coordinate the attempts to locate the high-risk missing patient or invite a representative from WMP to a 'daily appraisal' meeting to discuss the information and circumstances. By the time Mr Bari was found deceased WMP had not requested BSMHFT's written risk assessment which would have amplified some, but not all, of his suicide risk factors.","During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters causing concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. My principal concern is that when a high-risk mental health patient is missing it requires effective and meaningful multi-agency co-ordination. Locally, it engages BSMHFT's Missing Patient Policy (which purports to append WMP's missing person procedures), national College of Policing: Missing Person Authorised Professional Practice ('APP'), and National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person ('RCRP'). The evidence revealed significant gaps in knowledge, co-ordination and application of these policies. Specifically: (1) I am not reassured BSMHFT staff are handing attending police officers 'appendix C – risk rating' as required by their missing person policy. I am not reassured WMP officers are aware they should be provided with 'appendix C – risk rating'. Context: I did not accept the Nurse-in- Charge routinely used 'appendix C – risk rating', and police witnesses - including a Locate Sergeant, and the Head of Locate, a Detective Chief Inspector - indicated they had never seen 'appendix C – risk rating'. (2) A 'monitoring tool' in the BMSHFT Missing Patient Policy requires routine monitoring to ensure nurses are completing 'appendix A' and 'appendix B', but not 'appendix C – risk rating'. Context: I was told this is under review, however I was concerned this is still outstanding 9 months following the death. (3) I am not reassured BSMHFT Clinical Service Managers ('CSMs') are (a) coordinating the attempts to locate high-risk missing patients, and (b) inviting a representative from WMP to attend 'daily appraisal' meetings to discuss the high-risk missing patient's absence as required by their missing patient policy. I am not reassured WMP officers are aware this is the CSM's role and of the expectation of being invited to a 'daily appraisal'. Context: this process did not happen in Mr Bari's case, and the WMP's Head of Locate said she was not aware of the police ever being invited by a CSM to attend a 'daily appraisal'. (4) I am not reassured the RCRP 'challenge' process has been effectively communicated to BSMHFT. Context: I was told by WMP's Head of Locate there has been an agreed 'challenge' process to WMP's decision on risk category since February 2024, albeit BSMHFT have never used it. However, I heard from BSMHFT's Head of Acute Nursing that there was no such process. Further, she explained ongoing frustration bearing in mind BSMHFT's expertise, that WMP often do not accept BSMHFT's reported high-risk category, WMP often do not communicate they have not accepted it with BSMHFT only finding out much later, and WMP often close missing patient investigations without informing BSMHFT. (5) The BSMHFT Missing Person Policy purports to append WMP's missing person process but makes no mention of RCRP. I am not reassured the BSMHFT Missing Person Policy is therefore accurate and up-to-date. (6) RCRP does not require WMP to formally indicate to BSMHFT (i.e. via a form) when the police have taken a different view about the risk category. BSMHFT will often be unaware of the different view taken by the police rendering the 'challenge' process redundant and reducing the chances of the police identifying they have overlooked key information. (7) The BSMHFT Missing Patient Policy and RCRP do not require BSMHFT to hand attending constables a copy of the risk assessment, or require attending constables, or later the Locate team, to request a copy of the risk assessment. In the event of a conflict about risk category, requiring attending constables to take early possession of the written risk assessment may lead to the police identifying they have overlooked key information and revisit their own risk category. (8) RCRP and APP do not require attending constables to have particular regard to the expertise of mental health clinicians and hesitate or be extra vigilant before rejecting their opinion on risk category. RCRP and APP appear to regard reports from mental health clinicians no differently to those from members of the public, and family and friends of the missing person. Context: police witnesses agreed that BSMHFT clinicians were the experts on mental health diagnosis, including identifying those conditions that carry an increased risk of suicide, and assessing the risk of suicide generally. However, this case demonstrates how in the heat of the moment an (inexperienced) attending constable can overlook that expertise and quickly dismiss it. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest, before a jury, on the 17th May 2024. The medical cause of death was: Ia Ligature suspension The conclusion of the Inquest was “Frazer Charlie Williams died by suicide in circumstances where there was inadequate assessment and monitoring of his risks of self-harm and suicide prior to his death”.","Frazer was found deceased on the 7th March 2022, in his cell at HMP Guys Marsh, Shaftesbury, Dorset, suspended by a ligature [REDACTED] I have attached to this report the Record of Inquest.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. On the 4th June 2021 Frazer, was placed at HMP Lewes where he remained until his release on the 4th October 2021 having served a sentence of imprisonment. On the 7th October 2021, he was remanded into custody and placed at HMP Winchester. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on the 10th November 2021 and was due to be released on the 25th March 2022. ii. During his placement at HMP Lewes, Frazer presented with a deterioration in his mental health and remained subject to an ACCT due to an incident of self harm, and was also under the care of the healthcare team until the point of his release on the 4th October. iii. Following his arrival at HMP Winchester, which has a residential healthcare unit, referrals were made to the mental health team. Frazer was assessed by a psychiatrist on the 20th December 2021 who felt that he was suffering with enduring psychotic illness and required further review. iv. On the 14th January 2022 Frazer was transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. HMP Guys Marsh does not have a healthcare unit or a 24 hour in prison healthcare provision. The healthcare team operating hours are 7.30am to 6pm daily. v. An email was sent from the healthcare team at HMP Winchester to the healthcare team at HMP Guys Marsh with Frazer's name and that he was a person of interest. No other handover took place between the healthcare teams or the prison staff teams. vi. Following Frazer's transfer, the Head of Healthcare at HMP Guys Marsh raised an inappropriate transfer investigation as the clinical opinion was that he should not have been transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. Prior to Frazer's transfer, there had not been a discussion with the healthcare teams at HMP Winchester and Guys Marsh by the prison service to consider suitability of Frazer's transfer in view of the fact he was in the process of being assessed, and a confirmed diagnosis being made, relating to his mental health. vii. The Associate Medical Director for Practice Plus Group (PPG) who provided the healthcare at HMP Lewes and HMP Guys Marsh when Frazer was at those establishments, confirmed that there is no national directory that explains what healthcare facilities are 3 available at each prison and PPG have created one internally for the prisons they provide healthcare at. It was explained that this would assist when making decisions around suitability of location within the prison estate for prisoners, given their needs. Further if there was a national directory across all prisons this would greatly assist as PPG are only 1 of the 10 different healthcare providers across 114 prisons. He gave an example that he would not know how many disability access beds or cells there are at the prisons where PPG do not provide the healthcare. He also explained that there is no national specification in relation to healthcare units. viii. Frazer was a person with complex needs. His mental health deteriorated at HMP Guys Marsh. He would spend most of the time in his cell, he generally did not engage with staff or ACCT reviews, and there were records that he missed and secreted medication. He held delusionary beliefs that if his toilet was flushed or he watched television, his family would come to harm. His cell was in an extremely poor state, littered with rubbish, an unflushed toilet and a bucket which was used for him to urinate and defecate in. This bucket was found to be full in his cell at the time of his death. It was acknowledged by the staff at the time he was self neglecting and he was referred to the Safety Intervention Meeting (SIM) process on the 9th February 2022. The Head of Healthcare gave evidence that there was not an adequate plan between the prison and healthcare teams to manage Frazer's self neglect. ix. There is no national guidance on how to manage self neglect in prison. HMPPS are currently finalising a Social Care Learning Brief on Managing Self Neglect which is expected to be issued later this year, however there is no NHS guidance on this issue or joint guidance between HMPPS and NHS as to how to manage self neglect in a prison setting. x. Frazer's mental health deteriorated to such an extent that following an assessment on the 9th February 2022, he was deemed to require transfer to hospital under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The second doctor assessment was carried out the following day, 10th February 2022, and an application was sent to Ravenswood House Hospital, a secure unit within Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust on the 15th February 2022. Frazer was visited by the community psychiatrist on the 25th February 2022 when it was confirmed he required transfer to hospital for full assessment and treatment. The warrant was obtained from the Ministry of Justice for the transfer on the 1st March 2022. A bed was offered to HMP Guys Marsh by the hospital on the 1st March 2022 for admission on the 3rd March 2022, however, the prison could not facilitate an escort that day. The hospital could not facilitate safe admission on Friday 4th March 2022 or over the weekend, and the transfer was arranged for Monday 7th March 2022. Frazer was told on the 3rd March 4 2022 he would be transferred to hospital, however the evidence indicated he was not told when. At approximately 03.15am on the 7th March 2022 Frazer was found deceased in his cell, suspended by a ligature. xi. The ligature was made from a ripped bedsheet attached to the top corner of the cell door. The bedsheet was the same colour as the door and had not been seen prior to his death, and was therefore camouflaged. I refer to the attached photograph of the cell door which shows the ligature in place. The colour of the cell doors in each prison is directed by the Governor of the prison and not by national directive, however the same bedsheets are issued nationally across the prison estate. The similarity in colour could be a national issue and apply to other prisons. xii. An ACCT was opened in relation to Frazer on the 15th January 2022 and remained open until his death. Between 15th January and 7th March 2022 there were 11 case reviews. The ACCT records were incomplete and inadequate. The last case review took place on 1st March 2022. The next case review was scheduled for 3rd March 2022, however this did not take place and there was no further case review prior to Frazer's death. The evidence did not reveal why this had not taken place. As the ACCT is a paper based system, a missed case review is not automatically flagged in any way. xiii. Since Frazer's death there has been the implementation of the ACCT assurance process nationally which requires the ACCT paperwork to be reviewed on 3 occasions as quality assurance or audit. Firstly, between 25 and 72 hours of the ACCT being opened, secondly at day 7 of the ACCT being opened and finally at the post closure review. If a person is subject to an ACCT for a lengthy period of time, there is a gap between day 7 and the post closure review where no quality assurance is required to be undertaken. xiv. Frazer's key worker at HMP Guys Marsh gave evidence that in an ideal world prison officers would sit down with a prisoner for 45 minutes once a week to undertake key work as per national guidance. He explained that the 2 key work sessions he had with Frazer lasted no more than 5 minutes and were conducted on the landing outside his cell whilst other people would be walking around the wing. This was due to the fact the officer had to run the wing at the same time and he therefore explained the keywork sessions were not effective. He confirmed that the keywork sessions he undertakes now with prisoners now would probably be no more than 15 minutes. He further confirmed he was not invited to any of Frazer's 11 ACCT case reviews and to date he has never been invited to any ACCT reviews for any prisoner at HMP Guys Marsh, even as a prisoner's keyworker. xv. There is inequity in the system in that if a person is deemed 5 detainable under the Mental Health Act 1983 in the community, they will be admitted to hospital straight away. If there is no bed available in a psychiatric unit they will be placed in an acute hospital where there is monitoring and access to medical care 24 hours a day. If a person is in need of hospital care and treatment under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983, there are delays in the transfer to a hospital setting. When a prisoner suffers a physical health problem they can be transferred to hospital for care by ambulance or escort. With a mental health care problem, the appropriate paperwork needs to be completed, a hospital bed found and arrangements made for transfer before a person is admitted to hospital. During this time a prisoner may be placed, as Frazer was, in a prison without a healthcare unit and without 24 hour healthcare monitoring and care. The current legal timeframe for this is within 28 days. In relation to Frazer, his transfer would have been completed 26 days after he was first assessed Several witness said this was one of the quickest transfers they had experienced. xvi. When a code blue or code red is called at HMP Guys Marsh, evidence was given that the control room do not automatically call an ambulance and before doing so, ask questions such as is the patient conscious and breathing. Annex A of Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 03/2013 requires an ambulance to be called automatically as a mandatory contingency response upon a code blue or red being called, and the directs staff to await updates from the scene. This PSI is not currently being followed at HMP Guys Marsh. xvii. Frazer did not have any contact with his family whilst at HMP Guys Marsh and when his mother was told of his death, she thought it was a mistake as she thought he was still at HMP Winchester. She had been writing to Frazer at HMP Winchester through the email a prisoner service. There was no evidence her correspondence had reached Frazer. Email a prisoner is based on the person in the community who wants to contact the prisoner, entering the prisoner's location in the prison estate, rather than their unique prison number. If the location is wrong or the prisoner has been moved, the prisoner will not receive the contact. xviii. Frazer told prison staff during his induction at HMP Guys Marsh and the ACCT assessment that he was in contact with his family and he used his parents for support. Familial contact can be a key protective factor in the management of a person's mental health. In the personal information section of Frazer's NOMIS records, he was recorded as having no next of kin. There is no record the contact details of his next of kin were discussed with him. This evidences missed opportunities to involve Frazer's family in his care and management prior to his death. xix. Evidence was given that at the time if there was no next of kin 6 recorded for a prisoner at HMP Guys Marsh a monthly report would reveal this and prisoners would be spoken to about this. There is no record Frazer was spoken to about this and it did not appear from the prison there was a clear process as to how next of kin is detailed or checked. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. There is inequity within the system of the treatment of a person with mental illness in the prison setting compared to an individual in the community, due to the fact that in the community a person would be placed in a hospital setting on the day they were deemed to require hospital admission, however in prison there are delays in transferring a prisoner in the same situation to hospital. ii. There is a lack of NHS guidance, and joint guidance with HMPPS, on the identification, management, and treatment of someone with self neglect in the prison setting. iii. There is a lack of a national directory detailing the facilities and provision of healthcare at individual prisons across England and Wales, and associated guidance on the transfer of individuals between prison establishments when they are under the care of the healthcare teams and are not placed on medical hold. There is a lack of guidance on consultation with prison doctors where a prisoner is receiving medical care, whether that be for physical or mental health, when there is consideration by the prison to transfer the prisoner who is not placed on medical hold. Further there is a lack of consultation with the healthcare team at the proposed receiving prison to ensure they can provide the appropriate care for the person. iv. There is a lack of national guidance for healthcare teams working in prisons around the handover of healthcare of a prisoner to the receiving prison when they are transferred to another prison. v. There is a lack of national specification in respect of prison healthcare units. vi. There is lack of national guidance for both senior management and operational prison staff in relation to the handover of a prisoner in advance of their transfer, not specific to, but especially those with complex needs, when transferring between prisons. vii. The lack of ACCT quality assurance, or audit, between day 7 of the ACCT and the post closure review. viii. There is lack of automatic flagging of a missed ACCT review at HMP Guys Marsh and this could also be a national problem. 7 ix. Relevant individuals, such as key workers are not being invited to attend ACCT reviews at HMP Guys Marsh in line with ACCT 6 guidance. x. The keyworker scheme is not being delivered in line with national guidance at HMP Guys Marsh. xi. The colour of the cell doors and bedsheets at HMP Guys Marsh, and possibly at other prisons nationally, being very similar can camouflage ligatures. xii. PSI 03/2013 is not being followed at HMP Guys Marsh as there is no immediate call to the ambulance service when a code blue or red is raised. xiii. There is a lack of process regarding the recording of a prisoner's next of kin and involvement of them at HMP Guys Marsh. xiv. The email a prisoner system is dependant on the person wanting to contact the prisoner knowing their location, so if the prisoner is transferred to another prison and the person contacting them is not aware, contact which can be a protective factor particularly in a prisoner's mental health care, will not be facilitated. 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of: Suicide, whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed . The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Hanging","Katie Madden was declared deceased on 4th June 2023 at the [REDACTED] in Suffolk. Kate had been found by a friend, hanging [REDACTED] Kate's friend had attended after not being able to contact her for a couple of days. Kate was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and emotionally unstable personality disorder which made her act impulsively when faced with emotionally painful situations and stress. Kate had previously received a Claire's Law Domestic Violence Disclosure, and was known to be in a toxic relationship. Kate had historically and recently been the victim of domestic violence. Kate was known to both Mental Health Services, and Social Services, and her children were in care. Despite restrictions in place, Kate had argued with the subject of the Domestic Violence Disclosure just prior to her death. During the argument Kate was told to go and kill herself. Kate's toxic relationship, in conjunction with Kate's known mental health conditions, affected her state of mind and therefore contributed to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you; the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows. – 1. No evidence was seen that recipients of a 'Claires Law' Domestic Violence Disclosure are treated as being of greater vulnerability, or at a higher risk, when Child Services are undertaking investigations regarding the provision of children's care, and removal of the children from a parent is being considered. It was heard in evidence that the Social Worker appointed to this case, quite properly focussed on what was in the best interest of Kate's children. There was however no formal system in place to provide additional support for Kate herself, even though she was known to be vulnerable. 2. It was identified that when Kate was informed there may be an application to the Family Court to place her children into care (using the Public Law Outline process), the impact of such a decision on her mental health, or physical wellbeing was not taken into consideration. As a recipient of a 'Claires Law' Domestic Violence Disclosure, it was acknowledged that she was of greater vulnerability, but no system is currently in place which allows a risk assessment to be undertaken at the time the Public Law Outline notification is given to a parent. The day after Kate was told of the Public Law Outline notification, she intentionally crashed her car in an unsuccessful attempt to end her life, requiring 4 weeks in an Intensive Treatment Unit to recover from the serious injuries she received. 3. Once the Public Law Outline process was initiated, independent legal advice was provided, and a voluntary sector advocate supported Kate through the legal process. However, Katie received no independent support from Social Services, and had no independent professional to undertake a holistic review of her case, in light of her known circumstances and vulnerabilities. It was heard that mental health professionals had assumed Kate had a Social Worker of her own, and expressed surprise when finding out that she did not. 4. Safeguarding referrals made the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub in respect of Kate's children were viewed in isolation, with no system in place to the assess any additional risks posed to Kate herself. There were no additional steps, or risk assessments undertaken in relation to Kate, even though she was a recipient of a 'Claires Law' Domestic Violence Disclosure and therefore known to be more vulnerable. 5. In 2022 it was recognised by a Clinical Psychologist that Kate could benefit from Schema-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, which is not routinely available on the NHS. The psychological review had been ordered by the Family Court, and funding for this course needed to be applied for. Applying for funding involved requests to the Legal Aid Board, Integrated Care Board (Individual Funding Request), Wellbeing Service and Social Services, none of whom provided the funding, with each suggesting contacting one of the other agencies involved. An experienced mental health clinician with many years' experience described the 'whole route as very complicated' and 'it was difficult to find a solution for funding'. In addition, funding was very rarely made available, and as a service they were usually unable to meet patient expectations (who believe a treatment might be made available), where in reality it almost certainly would not be available. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The jury reached the following conclusion: Christopher MacGillivray hanged himself by a ligature whilst under the influence of a 3 combination of Cocaine and alcohol. 1a Pressure on the neck 1b Hanging,Christopher Alistair MacGillivray had a long history of Drug and Alcohol issues and attempted suicide and self-harm complicated by the impact of a brain injury sustained in an assault in 2018. He was charged with criminal offences for which he was granted conditional bail and subject to a curfew. He was also managed by Probation Service under the terms of a Probation Order for an earlier offence. On 9th October 2021 he was remanded in custody to HMP Durham for breach of his curfew. His arrest was precipitated by a member of the public who contacted police raising concerns for his welfare having seen him standing on the edge of a bridge. On 10th October Christopher Alistair MacGillivray reported thoughts of self-harm to prison staff. Suicide and self-harm prevention procedures known as ACCT (Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork) were implemented. He was placed on hourly observations. On 12th October Christopher Alistair MacGillivray was released on bail by Magistrates following a hearing via remote link. The ACCT was then closed. There was no direct communication from Prison to his Probation Officer/Manager in respect of his release and his risk of self-harm. On 14th October Christopher Alistair MacGillivray was found hanging in his home where his death was confirmed.,During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) The prison service instruction (PSI) 64/2011 sets out the procedures that must be followed to manage prisoner safety. The Annex sets out a mandatory process for the planned release of a prisoner who has been on an ACCT. Offender Management in Custody (OMiC) guidance provides for direct communication between Prison Offender Manager and Community Offender Manager in respect of prisoners at risk of self harm for SENTENCED PRISONERS ONLY. (2) The PSI is silent in respect of unplanned releases for 'prisoners on remand' with a known risk of self-harm and who may be released at short notice. There is no apparent direction/mandatory procedure for communication of the known risk of self-harm for unplanned release. (3) There is a risk of future deaths of prisoners in the category as at para 2 above. Urgent amendment to PSI/Annex and OMiC is required to set out procedures that must be followed in the management of the unplanned release of prisoners at risk of self-harm/suicide. 6

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 May 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion – Suicide – Contributed to by: Failings in communication and/or information sharing between healthcare staff at HMP Styal. Failings in communication and/or information sharing between prison staff at HMP Styal. Failings in communication and/or information sharing between healthcare staff and prison staff. Failure to pass on information in respect of Christine's daughter's wellbeing. Failure to assess Christine on her return from Wythenshawe Hospital. Failure to action Christine's request to see a nurse. Failures by healthcare to follow the clinical guidance in respect of the assessment and/or treatment of Christine's drug dependency. Neglect It was also found that the emergency response codes were not used which led to a delay in bringing the required emergency medical equipment, namely oxygen and the emergency bag and there was a significant delay in locating the defibrillator, although these issues did not contribute to Christine's death.","Christine McDonald was 55 years old at the time of her death on the 3rd March 2019. On the 1st March 2019 Christine was arrested at her home address and around the time of her arrest had witnessed her daughter fall from third-floor window and was concerned about her. Christine was taken to Blackpool Magistrates Court and sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment to be served at HMP Styal. Christine had a long history of drug dependency and at the time of her arrest she was known to be a user of Heroin, Crack Cocaine and Amphetamine. On the 2nd March 2019 Christine was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital following concerns raised during a healthcare assessment in HMP Styal. Christine discharged herself from hospital and was returned to HMP Styal. Just after 11pm on the 2nd March 2019 Officers went to speak to Christine in her cell and found her unresponsive, having tied a ligature [REDACTED]. The emergency response codes were not used and consequently, when Healthcare attended, they were unaware that they were attending an emergency and did not have the necessary emergency equipment with them. Although the failure to use the emergency response codes was not a contributory factor in the death, it caused a delay in providing the necessary medical treatment. Christine was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital but sadly passed away the following day with her family by her side.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) I heard evidence during the course of this Inquest in respect of the process for using the emergency response codes, this is something which arises in many cases of this type. I heard evidence in this case that the emergency response code was not used and as a consequence, those responding to the call were not prepared in the sense of emergency equipment, nor were they prepared mentally for the situation they had been asked to attend. I heard evidence in respect of the training and integrity testing that is now conducted to try to simulate the unexpected nature of an emergency, the evidence being that it is very difficult and that no training can fully prepare those staff who are first on scene for what they may find. I also heard evidence relating to measures within the control room, which might assist those first on scene in terms of the use of emergency codes and provide additional safeguards for those whose lives are at risk. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 May 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Suicide,"Emma Morris had a medical history of anxiety and depression. She had suffered a deterioration in her mental health and on the 20th September 2023, deliberately walked in front of a bus on the slip road of junction 39, Chester, heading towards the A55. A gatekeeping assessment had been completed by a mental health practitioner of the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team on the 19th September where the practitioner found that an informal inpatient admission to a mental health ward was clinically indicated, but this could not be facilitated immediately as there were no beds available nationally. She was therefore under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team at the time of death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The gatekeeping assessment included a mental health state examination, where it was the clinical opinion of the mental health practitioner from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team, that Ms Morris required an inpatient hospital admission to a mental health ward as there was an immediate risk to her safety as she was found to be a high risk of walking in front of a car. Whilst Ms Morris agreed to an informal admission, this was not possible at the time of assessment as there were no beds available nationally within the NHS or privately. As an inpatient admission was not possible, the option was to attend the Accident and Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Emergency Department or to remain in the community whilst waiting for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris had been informed that if she attended the Accident and Emergency Department, there could be a wait of three days for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris did not wish to wait in the Accident and Emergency Department for three days. A safety plan was agreed that Ms Morris would stay overnight with a family member, and would remain under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team who would review the following morning. The family felt that it was pushed for Ms Morris to stay overnight with a family member as there was no alternative to keep her safe. During the course of the inquest, I heard that there is national pressure on hospital trusts as there is a national increase in people waiting for inpatient beds. I am therefore concerned that there is a risk of future deaths as it is not possible to access inpatient mental health beds at the time of clinical need. 6"
https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/miriam-stone-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2024-0277,2024-05-20,"Sophie LOMAS, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Derby and Derbyshire 2",Derby and Derbyshire 2,1 Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Trust 1,"On 23 February 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Miriam STONE aged 41. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 07 May 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1 (a) Hypoxic Brain Injury Cardiac Arrest Ligature Application and Plastic Bag Asphyxia The conclusion of the jury at inquest was a narrative conclusion, namely that: “ Miriam carried out the deliberate act of ligating herself [REDACTED] on 18th February 2022, but in doing so, it is not possible to ascertain her intention. ” The jury found that a lack of formal risk assessment, a safety assessment which did not include all relevant risks and an inadequate care plan were probable contributing factors in Miriam ' s death. In addition, the jury found that the level of observations were likely assumed rather than individually assessed and that the level set, namely Level 3 every 15 minutes, was not appropriate.","The circumstances are summarised in the findings of the jury: “ Miriam Stone died on the 20th February 2022 at the Intensive Care unit at the Hospital. Miriam has a history of various mental health disorders including Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Schizophrenia and Bipolar. Miriam was admitted on numerous occasions and had a long history of self-harm by various methods [REDACTED]. Miriam was admitted to Hospital on the 15th February 2022 following an overdose. Whilst in hospital, Miriam undertook actions of self-harming and was distressed culminating in ligation whilst under 15 minute observations. This resulted in a decision to detain Miriam under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. Miriam was admitted to the Mental Health Unit on the 17th February 2022 as considered to be a high risk of self-harm or completed suicide and hospital considered a place of safety and assessment. Upon admission Miriam was presenting as calm and not in distress and was being monitored at 15 minute intervals. Miriam was interacting with staff but was not formally assessed by clinical staff and a safety assessment was only partially completed. No documented decision as to levels of observation or suicide risk exists to determine decisions made as to risk. On the morning of the 18th February 2022, 13 minutes after being observed by staff, Miriam was not observable in her bed space and staff recognising the ward toilet door was locked, subsequently found Miriam in the toilet [REDACTED]. This was swiftly removed and revealed a ligature around Miriam ' s neck [REDACTED]. Miriam was taken to hospital where she was intubated and ventilated. Despite treatment, her condition deteriorated and she died on 20th February 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Miriam was admitted to the mental health unit at approximately 8.30pm. The unit has a staff handover between 9.00pm and 9.30pm. The evidence at inquest was contradictory as to which shift had assumed responsibility for completing admission tasks including risk assessments and care / safety plans. It was recognised that admission shortly before or during shift handover can increase risks relating to the quality of information sharing and the allocation of admission tasks such as assessing the level of observations required. The court heard evidence that whilst efforts would be made to avoid admission during staff handover time this was a local practice rather than part of any formal policy. The court further heard evidence that senior staff considered that avoidance of admission at handover times would be difficult to achieve because there were too many different oranisations who might be requesting admission. This appeared to overlook the fact that it is the bed allocation team based at the trust who are the central point of contact. The current operational policy covering admission procedures (Acute Inpatient Operational Policy) does not mention a need for handover time to be protected, avoiding admission during this time. Without a formal policy on this topic there is a risk that future deaths could occur. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 May 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Lily Precious Jahany was an 18 year old university student. She was a bright intelligent girl, who was studying to become a Doctor. She resided in student accommodation in Leicester and had been in the city for a period of only 3 months at the time of her death. Lily had a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, but also was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety, had an underlying eating disorder and whilst not diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder, demonstrated certain traits associated with the condition, such as rigid thinking and perfectionism. Lily had a lengthy and complicated psychiatric history which was not fully appreciated by those clinicians whose care she came under during her time in Leicester due the lack of a single national medical record for patients, but also the fact that Lily was treated within the private sector. This had the impact of misleading those who treated Lily in the assessment of her risk. But conversely, placed upon them a greater duty and emphasis on ensuring they had at their disposal the relevant information to be able to properly and fully assess Lily's risk, which they failed to do. At the time of her death Lily had been closed to the Crisis Team and was awaiting assessment by the Community Mental Health team for a medication review by a psychiatrist. 3 weeks prior to her death Lily started to suffer manic episodes connected to her bipolar affective disorder. She took 3 overdoses and attempted to ligature on two occasions. Lily would decline hospital admission by the emergency services who attended on her, including on the 8th December 2022, when she was found to be ligating in her room in her student accommodation and paramedics and the police were called. On the 9th December 2022, Lily was found by accommodation staff in her room suspended by a ligature around her neck. Emergency services were called, but Lily was declared deceased at 12.35 hours. The cause of death was established as: I a Suspension by ligature","Lily Precious Jahany was an 18 year old medical student who had an extensive background history of mental health difficulties starting as early as the age of 7. She also had an extensive history of previous self harm. Lily was diagnosed with Bipolar Affective Disorder and was treated with Fluoxetine and Lurasidone and had input from a of counsellor. Lily was a highly complex young lady and in addition to her diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder had underlying diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder caused by the childhood trauma, depression and anxiety. Although not positively on the autistic spectrum disorder, Lily also demonstrated autistic spectrum disorder traits and had an underlying eating disorder. Lily started Leicester University in September 2022. By mid November 2022, Lily started to experience manic episodes connected to her bipolar symptoms and reported taking 3 overdoses on 15, 16 and 18 November. Lily refused to seek medical attention and when she did present to A&E on the 18th discharged herself before being assessed by the Mental Health team. Lily's maladaptive behaviors escalated further and she ligated on 1 st December 2022 and again on the 8th December 2022. In the week in between there were other episodes which could be construed as self harm through not eating necessitating ambulances to be called. The extent of Lily's mental health difficulties were not fully appreciated when she arrived in Leicester due to not only the absence of a national single electronic patient record but also because Lily was treated in the private sector and records held by private clinicians are not accessible within a national SystmOne record keeping system. This in my judgment had the impact of misleading those who treated her in the assessment of Lily's risk. But conversely, placed upon them a greater duty and emphasis on ensuring they had at their disposal the relevant information to be able to properly and fully assess Lily's risk. There were failures to obtain the full extent of Lily's mental health challenges and seek information which was pertinent to the assessment of her risk. However, whilst I find there were failures I cannot find on balance that those failures more than minimally trivially or negligibly contributed to Lily's death. At a time unknown between 11pm 8 th December 2022 and midday on the 9 th December 2022 Lily took increased doses of Zopicone and Promethazine and tied a ligature around her neck and she did so intending to die as a result of her actions. Lily was pronounced deceased at 12.35 hours on the 9 th December 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) (1) Lily resided at student accommodation provided by Student Roost. They describe themselves on their website as 'a student accommodation provider who puts your wellbeing first. Our aim is to provide the very best experience for you to make the most of student living. Since they were established in 2017, Student Roost has grown to offer 50+ properties across the UK. Student Roost run a 24/7 service including a Night Owl Service which is an excellent idea and provides a 24 hour service to help students with everything from loosing their keys, broken taps, but also their wellbeing. During the course of hearing evidence, it is evident that all of Lily's extreme acts of self-harm took place at her student accommodation. She took at least 3 overdoses and also carried out 2 acts of ligating which she had to be either untied or cut down from. One of those I heard required CPR. I am therefore surprised to learn that no staff (certainly in the 6 properties offering accommodation within Leicester) had first aid training and that it isn't mandatory, such that no staff are trained by Student Roost in first aid. It transpires therefore that any immediate first aid provided to Lily was provided by those who fortuitously had that training from other organisations before they joined Student Roost. In the context of this case but also wider than that, members of the accommodation staff could potentially be the first people at the scene of a situation requiring first aid and then emergency services; where death may occur the fact therefore that they receive no training concerns me. (2) I have spent a lot of time in this inquest investigating the information which was known about Lily, about her mental health and who had access to what information in the context of assessing her risk. In September of 2023, Miss Evans, Assistant Coroner sitting within the Rutland and North Leicestershire jurisdiction heard an inquest concerning a student at Loughborough University. Similar to Lily's case he was under the care of a private psychiatrist elsewhere in the country where he had lived prior to attending university. As a result of concerns in that case (his death occurring 1 year before Lily') around lack of contact by the Crisis Team at the time of assessment or otherwise with the private psychiatrist, the Coroner wrote to the Leicestershire Partnership Trust to share her concerns. The Trust referenced the Crisis Team Standard Operating procedure in the inquest in September 2023, the Coroner was concerned about the level of awareness that staff members had of any expectation required of them set out within that procedure to seek information from other agencies. I now have sight of the Cris Team Standard Operating Procedure. It sets out the keyworker responsibilities. The section is drafted presupposing that patients are receiving care and treatment from the Crisis Team and only at that point does the responsibility for seeking relevant information from other agencies kick in. Furthermore the emphasis upon that requirement is limited to one line which reads 'responsibility for referrals and liaising with other agencies involved'. That is anything but clear as to any expectation upon staff to ensure they have at their disposal all of the relevant risk information at the time of making that assessment; nor does it in my view set out any expectation upon staff to proactively Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 make contact with treating clinicians in the private sector to gain information. It would not capture situations such as Lily's, who was discharged from the Crisis Team after an 1 hour assessment and therefore was not under their care and treatment, I having found a failure to obtain all relevant information pertinent to her risk in assessing that risk. 6"

NHS England 1","On 27/11/2020 an investigation commenced into the death of Jada Monoja, a 33 year old man who died from a self-inflicted knife wound. His inquest was concluded on 23 April 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Monoja died by suicide, likely while experiencing delusional and paranoid thoughts.","Mr Monoja had a history of chronic paranoid and delusional thinking. On 15 November 2020 his mother contacted 111 after he disclosed suicidal thinking to her. This was rapidly escalated to mental health services and that evening a member of the Crisis Assessment Team (CAT) assessed Mr Monoja. He denied remaining suicidal, agreed to treatment and was assessed to have capacity. He was referred to the Home Treatment Team (HTT). On 16 November 2020 Mr Monoja was assessed and accepted by the HTT and a care plan agreed. In the early hours of 17 November 2020, his mother woke and found Mr Monoja had left their home. She found him nearby on Cleaver Square, unresponsive. Emergency Services attended but he could not be resuscitated. At home he had left notes of farewell.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Multiple witnesses indicated that the Risk Assessment Tool on the online system (EPJS) is not used in line with policy (i.e. that a new assessment in that tool is undertaken at the time of each admission/discharge/major risk event etc.), and, if updated, may only be updated in so far as additional narrative is added to the last such narrative in a previously completed assessment. Further, the evidence was that rather than be used for a detailed assessment per the indicators set out in the tool at the time of each relevant event, it was reviewed to instead access any past assessment in order (only) to establish quickly a benchmark against which the gauge a patient's current presentation when considering their risks. The detailed indicators informing the risk assessment were not updated. Although it was submitted that patient risk was nonetheless assessed and recorded in the EPJS, and acknowledged that benchmarking/comparison is useful, I am concerned that: (1) if the risk indicators set out in the tool are not systematically reviewed or reconsidered, then the assessment of risk that follows will then be based on incomplete, and therefore misleading, information; and (2) absent the above, and dating of revisions within a compound document, it is not clear on what indicators any assessment is in fact based (3) to the extent the risk assessment is used as a benchmarking tool, the impression given to the most recent viewer is then likely to be incomplete and misleading; (4) the apparent current use of the tool to establish a point of benchmarking/comparison is in any event lost where the compound narrative assessments are not clearly dated and signposted ; (5) if the detailed patient assessment is instead placed as a new entry in the general chronological notes, the usefulness of the tool as a clear, well signposted, dated assessment and documentation of the patients of risk(s), is lost, requiring a reviewer to instead review the general chronological log of entries on the EPJS where it is not required to be articulated in the same terms, and may be more difficult to identify in a longstanding patient. 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was that: suicide.,"Mr Luke Pearce was found hanging in his cell on 6 April 2023, at HMP/YOI Swinfen Hall. He was 21 years old. Mr Pearce had given no indication to staff that he was at risk of suicide or self harm in the months leading up to his death. Shortly after 5.30am on 6 April 2023, during a routine check, [REDACTED]. The officer called to Mr Pearce but got no response. He looked through the crack of the door and saw Mr Pearce with a ligature around his neck. The officer radioed for urgent assistance but did not use the appropriate coded wording of “Code Blue”. An Operation Support Grade attended and briefly entered Mr Pearce's cell before coming out again. When another officer attended, the first officer and OSG told her that she should not enter the cell as it was a crime scene. She contacted a custodial manager for permission to go in and then cut the ligature and lowered Mr Pearce to the floor. The officer and OSG waited outside and did not assist. At 5.40am, more staff arrived and the control room staff called an ambulance. Staff started CPR at 05.42am. Ambulance paramedics arrived at 5.59am and took over CPR.

However, we acknowledge that there will be occasions when an NHS referral is not achievable such as: i) The patient does not meet the criteria for referral into NHS community services, ii) The patient does not consent to such a referral, iii) Instances where a NHS community team receive but then refuse the referral, iv) Or there might be instances where a NHS community team have not yet confirmed the date and time of the initial contact In these circumstances, a follow-up telephone call will be made to the patient by the Priory ward staff within 48 hours of their discharge. This reflects current practice as recorded in Priory policy (H02 Admission, Transfer and Discharge). Should a concern be raised during the 48-hour phone call, this will be relayed promptly to the consultant psychiatrist who was responsible for the inpatient care for the consultant's review and guidance on any required subsequent action. Priory continue to work closely with NHS community teams to ensure safe inpatient discharge and we will carefully review the responses submitted by the Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care and Greater Manchester Integrated Care Board to this Regulation 28 report to ensure our approaches align. Priory are committed to making any relevant changes to our approach across the Healthcare division as required in order to ensure robust discharge and aftercare arrangements between Priory and the NHS. I trust that the actions outlined above will provide the assurances you seek in respect of this matter. A8 3 Yours sincerely, Chief Executive Officer Priory A9 Healthcare © Priory – Confidential H-SOP34 – Safer Adult Acute Inpatient Ward Discharge Healthcare – V01 – H02 – July 2024 Planning - Follow Up Arrangements Page 1 of 3 Standard Operating Procedure: Safer Adult Acute Inpatient Ward Discharge Planning - Follow Up Arrangements All acute inpatient wards (NHS funded and Private): All Priory acute inpatient wards irrespective of funding arrangements must consider discharge planning as soon as possible after admission, and this must be documented in CareNotes (electronic patient care record). This should include consideration for who and which services are most appropriate to complete the 'within 72 hour' follow up contact. This must be documented in the discharge plan. CareNotes must be updated with information about the patient's family, carers and other relevant and involved health and social care services. The discharge destination (such as a patient's home address or alternative address) must be documented on CareNotes as soon as possible once established. Patients with a current or historical risk of suicide and/or self-harm will be offered the opportunity to complete a 'My Safety Plan' with support from their Named Nurse during their inpatient admission. This plan will develop during the course of their admission in order to document their risks, protective factors and risk management strategies found to be effective during the course of the admission. This plan will be devised collaboratively with the patient and a copy will be provided to the patient following initial completion, following reviews and on discharge. This document will support discharge planning and a copy will be shared with the patient's family (subject to patient consent). Introduction: The transition from mental health inpatient facilities to home environments or other destinations may give rise to a heightened risk of self-harm. Research from the National Confidential Inquiry into suicide and mental health safety indicates that a significant proportion of suicides post inpatient discharge occur within the initial week of discharge, peaking on the third day (within 72 hours) and before there has been any follow-up with the patient. Priory therefore considers that there should be more robust aftercare arrangements to ensure follow-up contact within 72 hours for all patients leaving acute inpatient care. Priory have two types of acute adult inpatient wards: • Acute inpatient wards: These wards host NHS funded patients either on a contracted bed or a spot purchase arrangement. NHS Trusts or Integrated Care Boards (ICB's) fund NHS patients. Following treatment, patients are discharged back to the relevant NHS Trusts/ICB who are responsible for the ongoing care of the patient. • Private acute inpatient wards: These wards admit patients whose admissions are funded by the patient themselves, or via their private medical insurance or any other self-funding arrangements. On most occasions, local NHS Trusts or ICB's do not fund these patient admissions. A10 Healthcare © Priory – Confidential H-SOP34 – Safer Adult Acute Inpatient Ward Discharge Healthcare – V01 – H02 – July 2024 Planning - Follow Up Arrangements Page 2 of 3 Private acute inpatient wards (non-NHS funded patients): All discharge plans including the 'within 72 hour' follow up must be discussed and agreed with the patient and with their consent, with the patient's family, carers and relevant care agencies involved in the care of the patient. Discharge plans must be documented clearly in CareNotes and shared with the patient, including with the referrer and their family/carers (with the patient's consent). In cases, where a patient does not provide consent for crisis discharge plans to be shared with their family/carers, consider sharing generic discharge planning information with the patient's family/carer where appropriate. All hospital sites will have an updated local NHS Mental Health Services Directory with the focus being on Crisis Teams, Home Treatment Teams, Community Mental Health Teams, specialist mental health services and any other relevant mental health services in the region/local area. The information required to populate this can be gathered from local NHS Trusts, GP's and other healthcare services. This directory must be updated annually and shared with all healthcare professionals at the hospital, including Visiting Consultants, to ensure up-to-date awareness of the local NHS services available. Patients who would have qualified for NHS funded care and were admitted to a private acute inpatient ward due to non-availability of NHS beds and/or patient choice, must be considered for referral to NHS services for 'within 72 hour' follow up and/or longer-term care when planning their discharge. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) should consider whether a patient requires a higher level of support, follow up and care from NHS services as there are limitations in the community support that private services can provide (see section 3 for criteria). Where such community intervention is required, patients should be referred to the local NHS Home Treatment Team, Crisis Team or Community Mental Health Team prior to discharge. Irrespective of whether NHS services accept or decline the referral, the referral should be clearly documented with a rationale in CareNotes. In the case of a decline of the referral by NHS services, or in instances where a NHS community treatment team have not yet confirmed the date and time of the initial contact or where a patient does not meet the criteria (see section 3) or should the patient refuse such a referral, the Priory MDT must develop a clear follow up plan, which includes 'within 72 hour' follow up. This will usually take the form of a phone call from the ward staff within 48 hours post discharge in accordance with Priory policy. Any actions, which may be needed in the event that staff are unable to contact the patient, will be considered on an individual basis and documented within the discharge MDT meeting. The MDT must also document a confirmed date and time of any future outpatient appointment with the Visiting Consultant/Therapist and update the patient and their family/carers on crisis management plans including advice on accessing local urgent NHS Crisis Team services or A&E services if required. A11 Healthcare © Priory – Confidential H-SOP34 – Safer Adult Acute Inpatient Ward Discharge Healthcare – V01 – H02 – July 2024 Planning - Follow Up Arrangements Page 3 of 3 Should a concern be raised during the 48 hour call, this will be relayed to the consultant psychiatrist who was responsible for their inpatient care for their review and guidance on any required subsequent action. Criteria to consider referral of patients to NHS services for private acute inpatient wards (non-NHS funded patients) NHS mental health services include Crisis Teams, Home Treatment Teams, Community Mental Health Teams, specialist mental health services and any other relevant mental health services in the region/local area. The following list is not exhaustive: 1. The patient is already under the care of NHS mental health services 2. The patient has been admitted whilst awaiting a NHS bed and such inpatient beds are not available 3. The patient was detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 either prior to private admission or during private admission 4. The patient may meet the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act 1983 in the present or near future 5. There is a high risk of self-harm or suicidal ideation with or without plans and intention 6. There is a high risk of harm to others 7. There is a high risk of disengagement with mental health services and this may lead to increased risks/deterioration of mental health condition 8. The patient may need specialised services such as perinatal care, treatment for resistant conditions, or a lack of social care and presenting with risks 9. The patient is subject to MARAC, LADO, or any other significant safeguarding concerns that require multidisciplinary support and engagement 10. The patient requires multidisciplinary intensive support that cannot be offered by private services 11. At the request from the patient, or their family/carers or referrer 12. The patient has co-existing mental health challenges along with substance misuse and may present with risks to self and/or others 13. The patient requires follow up or observations in between private outpatient appointments, as private services at Priory do not offer emergency care and/or treatment 14. Circumstances in which safer prescribing is not possible Visiting Consultants, sessional therapists and all staff on private acute inpatient wards must familiarise themselves with the local NHS Mental Health Services Directory which will include details about the local Crisis Teams, Home Treatment Teams, Community Mental Health Teams, specialist mental health services and any other relevant mental health services in the region/local area. A12","On the 9 th October 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Benjamin Sulzbacher who died on the 27 th September 2023. The investigation concluded on the 2 nd May 2024. The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a) Hanging. A conclusion of suicide was recorded.","Mr Sulzbacher had suffered from a deterioration in his mental health for a number of years. This became more acute during 2023. Throughout this time he had accessed assistance from professionals within his community and this was done on a private basis. On the 24 th August 2023 having tried to tie a ligature at home, he was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department at North Manchester General Hospital. He was assessed and it was recognised he required an inpatient admission which he agreed to as a voluntary patient. Due to the only available acute inpatient bed being in the South, his family funded a private admission at the Priory hospital in Altrincham. He was an inpatient from the 26 th August until the 18 th September 2023. On his discharge from the Priory part of the discharge plan was for a follow up phone call within 48 hours. This occurred on the 21 st September 2023. Learning from how this call was conducted has already been recognised by the Priory. The court heard evidence that no referral was made to the NHS mental Health trust for follow up via the Home Based Treatment Team. In this case due to where Mr Sulzbacher lived, a referral would have been to Pennine Care NHS Trust Foundation Trust. This would have occurred automatically if he had been an NHS inpatient. The court heard if a referral had been made to the Home Based Treatment Team they would have conducted a face to face follow up within 72 hours and if necessary, would have remained engaged with Mr Sulzbacher for up to 4 weeks. The court also heard evidence that the NHS Trust would have accepted such a referral even though Mr Sulzbacher had been a private paying inpatient. The evidence from the family was that Mr Sulzbacher's mental health declined on his return home and he died having tied a ligature on the 27 th September 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
For the Priory
1. There was a lack of understanding from the Priory witnesses as to what the NHS community services could offer on discharge. The court heard that the Home Based Treatment Team was understood to simply be a ""Crisis team"" which was incorrect.
For All:
1. It was unclear to all services as to whether a private paying inpatient (who would have qualified for care under the NHS but due to bed availability went private) would be entitled to be referred to the discharge services offered by the NHS. The NHS provides more than the private sector in respect of community discharge packages and can be engaged with someone for longer. Importantly the face to face contact enables a better understanding of how a patient is actually presenting when considering their mental health."

In accordance with the wishes of his mother who attended inquest, I shall refer to him hereafter as Brandon. I recorded the cause of death as 1a) Asphyxia 1b) Fatal pressure on the neck; II) PTSD; Autism I concluded Brandon died from suicide.","Brandon had suffered adverse childhood experiences including neglect and emotional abuse that led to his adoption along with his brother. As he grew into adolescence and then early adulthood mental health difficulties emerged that led to a diagnosis of complex PTSD/emotionally unstable personality disorder. Additionally, he had a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder. In total, Brandon had five Mental Health Act assessments between May 2021 and May 2023, to include two on consecutive days on 14 and 15 May 2023, the latter following detention under s136. I heard at inquest that it is contrary to national guidance and local policy to admit someone with PTSD/EUPD into hospital and, absent any other therapeutic option, the consultant psychiatrist referred Brandon to the local CMHT. He was discussed at MDT on 23/5/23 and a duty worker spoke to him on 16/6/23 when a decision was made to put him on the CMHT therapy pathway. He was found deceased five days later before any treatment had commenced. On reflection, it was noted that referrals would aim to be actioned within five days but took 16 here. The inquest heard that the CMHT was short- staffed at the time and the Manager concerned was fulfilling two roles.","During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) Shortage of staff. This has been a longstanding concern in Cornwall. I am aware there have been initiatives undertaken nationally and internationally and yet the problem remains. It seems this is not an issue that can be resolved by the local ICB and so this concern is directed to the Secretary of State for her attention and formal response. The following two issues require a response from the ICB and not the Secretary of State. (2) As noted above, the inquest was informed that where patients with complex PTSD/EUPD present in crisis, national and local practice is not to detain in a secure hospital. The inquest also heard that in other areas of the country there is a therapeutic alternative of admission to a day hospital (ie not detained, but somewhere to permit de-escalation) or to a crisis unit/house/café. That option is not currently available in Cornwall. (3) The inquest heard that CPFT is commissioned to assess 140 patients annually for autism. The current waiting list for assessment is in the region of two years. In other words, the demand for the service greatly exceeds the current supply. 6"

It was recognised that his housing was impacting his mental wellbeing but the support services available to him (as a palliative care patient) did not have the resources/capacity to assist him in moving to alternative accommodation for the last few months of his life. The evidence was that because he lived in social housing he had to bid for alternative accommodation. The bidding process was digital and he struggled to manage that. In addition even if he made a bid the chances of success were extremely slim given the huge demand for property. The inquest was told as an illustration that the Housing Association that he was a tenant of had 35,000 properties but a waiting list of 17,000. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 01 May 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was one of suicide.,"Evie Jane Davies was found deceased [REDACTED] at home on 2 December 2021 having taken a significant overdose of medication which had not been prescribed to her. It is likely that this was a deliberate act with the intention to end her life, contributed to by a deterioration in her mental health which commenced in June 2021 following the unexpected death of her partner, and was compounded significantly over the following months by on- going family proceedings regarding her children, lack of regular contact with her children and a forthcoming criminal hearing which she perceived would also impact upon her ability to be with her children. In the 6 month period prior to her death, Evie was being supported by the mental health team (part of CWP), had an allocated care co-ordinator until November 2021, and in the last few weeks before her death was under the home treatment team. The mental health team supporting her were aware of her on-going stressors and that 3 December was a key date for Evie, the anticipation of which was significantly affecting her mood. On 1 December Evie received some unwelcome news. It is described by the GP that she called the crisis line and was directed to the cafe71 service. There were no notes of this call available to the inquest as the pro forma supplied to the GP is blank but it is likely, given what we know of the background circumstances and the susbequent events, that she shared some distress during this call.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The evidence I heard was that the café71 service is run as a crisis line for those who are in 'lesser crisis' than those who would call the mental health team crisis line or the crisis resolution home treatment team. It appears that the cafe71 team is operating in isolation/ separately to the mental health team, and for those patients who are under the mental health team, they will be unaware of the background and the risk factors for that person. They will take an assessment of that person at face value based on how they are in the call, as they don't have access to the information held by the mental health team. In addition, there does not appear to be any notification to the mental health team to say that the person has been in contact such that this can be followed up. It is likely that there is notification to the GP but in this case there was no detail provided which could have been passed on, and the timescales for review of correspondence by the GP, who again are operating somewhat in isolation to the mental health team, does not lend itself to the prompt action which may be required by the mental health team. I am concerned that the lack of information sharing between the organisations, and in particualr in real time or as near as possible, gives rise to a risk of future deaths and consider that your organisation has the power to take action, either as provider of the service or as commissioner. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 30/04/2024. The conclusion of the Inquest was that Mrs Gawthorpe's death was a suicide.,"Laura Gawthorpe was a voluntary patient at the Becklin Centre, Alma Street, Leeds. On 13th September 2022, she left the Becklin Centre on unescorted leave and made her way [REDACTED], where CCTV tracked her making her way to levels [REDACTED] of the car park, and thence back down [REDACTED] from where she deliberately fell to the ground below, dying instantly from unsurvivable injuries.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) The evidence of West Yorkshire Police was that, by the erection of extensive fencing and barriers, measures have been put in place on levels at the car park to make it harder for people to fall from those levels, whether deliberately or accidentally. (2) The erection of similar measures on level has been only partial. The point from where Mrs Gawthorpe fell was identified by correlating her location on the ground with the location on level where she had left her phone before her fall. At that location, the parapet wall could still easily be climbed over."

Kellie died on 26 August 2017 in Lister Hospital. She was 30 years old. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 06 July 2023. The medical cause of death was 1a) features consistent with hanging. The jury recorded a short form conclusion of unlawful killing and a narrative conclusion as follows: After being subjected to months of controlling and coercive behaviour and domestic abuse by her then partner, on the morning of 23rd August 2017 Kellie Sutton hung herself [REDACTED] She was treated at the scene by ambulance staff and HEMS before being conveyed to the Lister Hospital. Her injuries were not survivable and she died at 2.30pm on 26th August 2017 in the hospital. The jury found that there were certain failures or inadequacies by Herfordshire Constabulary which may have contributed to Kellie Sutton ' s death, but not that they did: see Annex A – Determination sheet.","Kellie Sutton had experienced a series of relationships from a young age with abusive men in the past. She had 3 children. Kellie met her final partner in March 2017 and he moved in to her home [REDACTED] where she lived with two of her children in a shared custody arrangement. There was extensive and detailed witness evidence gathered by the police for criminal proceedings which demonstrated that Kellie ' s partner was abusive towards her: both physically violent on at least several occasions and by his controlling and coercive behaviour towards her, which included shouting, threatening, phoning constantly if she was out, isolating her from her family and friends and holding her bank card. She lived in fear of her phone battery dying because if he couldn ' t get hold of her he would “ go mad ” and would become violent. In March 2018, i.e. after her death, Kellie ' s partner was convicted of controlling and coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship, contrary to s76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015, the offence taking place between 1 March 2017 and 24 August 2017. He was also convicted of one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the offence taking place on 3rd June 2017 and one count of common assault which occurred on 9 July 2017. I am satisfied from the evidence, which included text messages from Kellie to friends and from Kellie to her partner that Kellie was very unhappy in this relationship but did not feel able to extricate herself from it, even though her friends were telling her he was abusive. On 9 July 2017 a neighbour called the police on the basis that Kellie was being “ beaten up by her partner ” . The police came very quickly and spoke to Kellie and her partner separately but the couple told them that they had just had a verbal argument. A risk assessment in the form of the DASH book was completed which resulted in 6 ticks and the police took the view that this was a ' standard risk ' case and the matter was closed as a non-crime incident. The police did not speak to the neighbour who called 999 and who was in possession of significant further information about the incident, including that one of the children had witnessed it. In a witness statement for the inquest the police accepted, at a senior level, that the response fell below the expected standard in a number of respects, including body worn video capability, the failure to check up on the children and that they showed a lack of professional curiosity and judgment relating to the DASH process and house to house inquiries not being completed. The controlling and coercive behaviour continued. Over the night of 22/23 August 2017, there were a series of exchanges both verbally and by text message which continued after Kellie ' s partner left for work at 650 a.m. This showed a series of increasingly distressed messages from Kellie culminating in her threatening to hang herself to which he had responded with words to the effect of ' do everyone a favour ' . Very shortly thereafter she stopped answering the phone, he rushed home and found her hanging [REDACTED] , at about 810 a.m. Despite him administering CPR to her and the ambulance arriving shortly thereafter, tests showed that she had suffered irrecoverable brain injury from lack of oxygen and brain stem death was confirmed on 26 August 2017 when she was pronounced dead. The inquest jury found that although they were not satisfied that the lack of further investigation or action on 9 July 2017 did contribute to Kellie Sutton ' s death, they found that it may have led to further interventions that could have altered the final outcome on 23 August 2017. The jury also found that numerous opportunities were missed at several levels to recognise the significance of the responses in the DASH and that this in turn led to a failure to consider implementation of appropriate protective measures, which could have included issuing a DVPN and/or applying Clare ' s law. However, they concluded that they could not be satisfied that these failings did contribute to Kellie Sutton ' s death, although they may have contributed to her death. During the course of the inquest the court heard evidence from an expert in the field of violence against women and girls about the harms of controlling and coercive behaviour and abuse, the feelings of entrapment by victims meaning it was very common for a victim to be unable to extricate themselves and the higher incidence of suicide in victims of abuse: one third of all suicides in England and Wales are preceded by domestic abuse. The court heard that an understanding of controlling and coercive behaviour was key to any risk assessment and that it was important to understand that no physical assault was required. The evidence at the inquest indicated a lack of awareness of the link between domestic abuse and suicide. Whilst officers did have an awareness of the ' harm ' from others through domestic abuse, a heightened awareness of the risk of ' harm ' by taking one ' s own life was relevant to a risk assessment and the consequential steps which may be required. The evidence at the inquest also appeared to reveal a lack of understanding by front line officers of the circumstances in which a DVPN could be applied for, and whether it was necessary for an individual to have been subject to arrest prior to triggering a referral to the DAISU I am of the view that this lack of understanding, notwithstanding training which had been provided, was evident and created a risk of future deaths. The court heard about the lack of systems available at the time to easily identify serial perpetrators of abuse. However, I accept the evidence from the Constabulary about the changes that have already been made and further developments that are on-going. Accordingly this element does not form one of my elements of concern.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. There was a lack of understanding of controlling and coercive behaviour, what it is, and the impact on victims. 2. There was a lack of awareness of the link between domestic abuse and suicide. 3. There was a lack of understanding by front line officers of the circumstances in which a DVPN could be applied for, and whether it was necessary for an individual to have been subject to arrest prior to triggering a referral to the DAISU. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 April 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative: Jason Pulman died as a result of suicide. Jason died by hanging, potentially through his mental health and gender identity issues. Within this context, it is possible his relationship with his boyfriend exacerbated his low mood. It is also possible Jason may have been prevented from committing suicide if British Transport Police had been notified that Jason was a missing person who was possibly on a train.","Jason Pulman was found on 19 April 2022, by a member of the public, [REDACTED]. He was pronounced dead on the scene.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. I heard evidence at the inquest that Jason did not receive specialist gender dysphoria treatment because he was on the waiting list for the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. There was also evidence that clinicians did not refer Jason for specialist psychiatric support from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in part because the guidance at the time suggested any specialist gender dysphoria treatment should be provided by GIDS. Jason was awaiting a further assessment from CAMHS at the time of his death. 2. On 10 April 2024, i.e. during the course of the inquest, published her report on the independent review of gender identity services for children and young Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 people (the Cass review). Her recommendations included that: “a smaller number of secondary services within CAMHS and paediatrics should be identified initially to act as Designated Local Specialist Services (DLSS) within each area. This would increase the available workforce through a flexible, multi-site staff group working between the DLSS and the regional centre, with the opportunity to provide targeted training and upskilling.” 3. The Arden and GEM has provided an update on its website entitled the “National Referral support Service for the NHS Gender Incongruence Service for Children and Young People”. This states: “The NHS understands it isn't easy having to wait a long time to be seen by gender services, and young people may need some extra support with their mental wellbeing while they wait. The NHS is offering this support, if needed, through local Children and Young People Mental Health services (CYPMH), also known as Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). People will be contacted to ask if they are happy for their details to be shared with their local CYPMH / CAMH service so they can speak to a professional about how they are feeling. This support offer is voluntary and the people's place on the Children and Young People's Gender Services waiting list will not change. This service will be contacting parents, children and young people on the waiting list by email or post to ask if they wish to access this support between April and May 2024.” 4. During the inquest, I heard evidence from senior management at the CAMHS run by Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust to the effect that (i) they were unaware that enhanced support was being offered via CAMHS and (ii) due to existing pressures on resources the enhanced support would likely have an impact on the already very long wait times for CAMHS treatment, which in turn would give rise to a risk of patients taking their own lives while waiting for treatment. 5. I am concerned that if urgent clarity is not provided to CAMHS teams, patients and parents on the appropriate national referral mechanisms for gender services, and the resources available for those services, there is a risk that the circumstances arising prior to Jason's death could be repeated. 6"

Rt Hon Victoria Atkins, Department of Health And Social Care, 39 Victoria Street, London, SW1 H 0EU","On the 17th December 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Charlie Millers. Charlie died on the 7th December 2020. The investigation concluded on the 25th April 2024. The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a) Hypoxic Brain Injury 2) ADHD, Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, Mixed Conduct Disorder and Autism. A jury recorded a narrative conclusion.","On the 2nd December 2020 Charlie was detained under Section 2 Mental Health Act 1983 on Junction 17 the Child Adolescent Mental Health unit at Prestwich Hospital. At 22:31 hours he was found in his room having tied a ligature. He died 5 days later in Salford Royal Hospital. This was Charlie's third inpatient admission since July 2020. During his most recent admission it was accepted that his self harming behaviour had escalated in frequency and severity. It was recognised by his clinical team that being an inpatient was not assisting Charlie. Charlie had returned from home leave at 19:45 hours on the 2nd December, it was known and recognised that return from home leave was a time when Charlie would ligature. Charlie was therefore on 1:5 minute observations with increased 1-1 support if he required it. At the time the Trust Observation Policy allowed two forms to be used in order to conduct 1:5 observations: One form ensured the staff member recorded details every 5 mins. None of these forms were completed on the evening of the 2nd December for Charlie. Indeed for his entire three admissions , spanning almost three months, only one such form was located. A second form meant staff only had to sign once at the end of the period of observations ie hourly. (“Level 2 hourly form”) In addition there was a separate Level 3 Observation 1:15 minute form which was completed for all young persons who as a matter of routine were checked every 15 minutes. The court heard evidence that at the commencement of each shift the nurse in charge allocated staff members their roles for the shift. This would change hourly and should be detailed on the allocation sheet. In addition the court heard that the staff member completing 1:5 minute checks on a young person would be different from the person completing the 1:15 minute checks on all the young people. On the 2nd December Staff the a/location sheet shows; 8-9am – No-one allocated to Charlie's 1:5 obs. HB allocated to 1:15 obs for everyone. 9-10pm Staff Member HB allocated to Charlie's 1:5 obs. D allocated to 1:15 obs for everyone 10-11pm Staff Member D (female) allocated to Charlie's 1:5 obs. M allocated to 1:15 obs for everyone. Level 3 1:15 Form Between 9pm – 9.45 D signs every 15 minutes to say 1:15 obs completed on all yps 10pm -10.30 staff HO signs to say 1:15 obs completed on all yps. Level 2 Hourly Form for Charlie's 1:5 observations 8-9pm signed by 0– 0-told the court h-e signe-d th-is forrn al -ap,-n but -h ad not done the-ob servations, the space was blank and he used more space for his entry at 9pm 9-10pm signed by D pm signed by HO (Charlie was found at 22:31 hours) The evidence therefore suggests that if Charlie's 1:5 observations were being undertaken from 9pm onwards, they were being undertaken by the same member of staff who was undertaking 1:15 minute checks on the other young persons . His final ligature was the fourth one Charlie had tied from returning back to the ward at 7.45pm. Previous Observation Issues Death of RT In October 2020 another young person had died on a different ward at this site. During the course of that Inquest it was found observations were not being conducted appropriately in that staff were not completing observation checks. As a result, management were supposed to be auditing observation documentation daily. Albeit it was acknowledged audits of paperwork would not evidence if staff were falsifying the documentation ie competing the paperwork but not doing the check. A regulation 28 report was issued following this Inquest. Death of AS In June 2021 another young person died on another ward in Junction 17. At the time this individual was on 1:5 minute observations. A similar regulation 28 report was issued in respect of the 1:5 documentation and the evidence to the court at that stage was that there was no other 1:5 observation record other than the Level 2 hourly form. The court was concerned as there was no record to say 1:5 checks were done. In light of the evidence in Charlie's case this appears inaccurate. At this time the audit by senior managers, which had been put in place in October 2020 should have been ongoing Investigations and Reviews Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust Root Cause Serious Incident Reports. All three deaths were reviewed internally by GMMH. In respect of the investigation into Charlie's death the review was completed by clinical team members. Whilst some inhouse training is provided as to how to conduct reviews, they are not trained investigators. The Inquest ascertained that not all the staff who were on duty on the night Charlie ligatured were spoken to or asked for statements. The findings of the investigation relied on the completed observation sheets to reach a finding that i) Charlie's 1:5 observations were conducted (ii) that they were conducted by the staff member who was already completing 1:15 obs. There was no questioning as to the accuracy of this or how this was possible. Nor whether this was in line with Trust policy, nor whether this was a safe practice for all the young persons on the ward. It did not consider whether the senior manager audits were being conducted. Following the deaths of Charlie and the other young persons NHS England commissioned an Independent desktop review of the three cases. This review had access to the Trust's Root Cause Analysis Serious Investigation Reports and simply relied on their findings. This review did not highlight any concerns. Greater Manchester Police – In January 2023 the Inquest into Char lie's death was adjourned following identification of the 1:5 observation sheet detailing an entry for every 5 minutes. GMP were asked to review this case to consider if there were potentially any individual criminal offences or corporate offences. GMP reported that there was no evidence of any criminal offences. At this time GMP were also considering wider issues relating to concerns raised from the BBC Panorama programme about the Edenfield unit which is based on this site. GMP also investigated the other two deaths. Not all the members of staff who were on duty that night were spoken to. Three members of staff were interviewed. D and HO confirmed they were doing the 5 minute observations as they signed the hourly sheet. This investigation does not appeared to have considered how this was possible if the staff were conducting 1:15 checks on the other young people. Nor whether this was in line with Trust policies or whether it made for a safe environment for all the young persons. Independent Review of Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust December 2023 by Professor Oliver Shanley. This report was England following the BBC programme which aired in September 2022. [REDACTED] gave evidence to the court in Charlie's Inquest. He told the court that as part of his investigation in September 2023 his team requested copies of the audits of observations by senior managers. He requested them from June, July and August 2023. He was subsequently advised that it had been discovered by the Trust that there, “was no formal system and process in the form of governance and the application of this audit was at ward level.” Evidence showed in July 2021 the audit was completed 17 times out of 28 (61 %0. In 2022 it was completed 25 times out of 52 (48%) and in 2023 it was completed 9 times out of 36 (25%). In conclusion Professor Shanley found (para 9.103 ): “The Trust reviewed and ratified their Therapeutic Engagement and Observation Policy in September 2023. However, it is noteworthy that it doesn't address the original problem. There was no issue with the policy and the Trust was able to demonstrate that a number of staff working on that ward understood the policy and its implementation, but for reasons that are stiff not fully understood, they failed to follow its guidance.” No investigation was conducted.by the Care Quality Commission who were aware of Charlie's death. No investigation was conducted by the Health Services Investigations Body and it does not appear they were made aware of this case. Without oversight of all cases and issues it is not clear whether the report of Charlie's death in isolation would meet their criteria.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:­ 1. Deaths of patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 are not subject to any independent investigation in the same way as deaths in police custody (Independent Office Police Complaints) or in Prison (Prison and Probation Ombudsman). As a result, investigations are not effective, no single body has oversight of previous concerns and how these were going to be rectified by the organisation. Therefore critical learning and evidence is being lost which may prevent future deaths. 2. In addition the Investigations which are currently being undertaken are ineffective either due to a lack of trained, investigators who conduct internal reviews or a lack of understanding of complex health processes and procedures. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 April 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was death by misadventure. The medical cause of death was: 1a. Asphyxiation 1b. ligature hanging 2 ASD ADHD anxiety.","Erik Marshall died on 30 September 2023 at his home address [REDACTED] in Cheshire. He was found suspended by a ligature [REDACTED] Prior to this he had suffered from ADHD, mental health issues and had recently received a clinical diagnosis of autism. Erik's sensory needs and mental health presentation meant that he habitually partly drowned himself in the bath [REDACTED] to experience a buzz and the feeling of numbness in his arms and legs. Erik's mental health needs were being treated in the community following an inpatient admission at ancorra house and the Priory. During admission to the Priory Erik was clinically diagnosed with autism. Following discharge from the Priory the plan was to obtain a sensory assessment through OT in the community to help him with the high risk sensory behaviours. The Child Development Centre CDC, art of Bridgewater Community Healthcare NHS Trust, were invited to the CPA meetings and were aware of Erik. Referrals were made to the CDC for an ADOS assessment and OT input in May 2023. The CDC responded to state they did not require an ADOS assessment to provide the support but they did want to review the assessment undertaken at the Priory to see if this complied with NICE guidance before any referral to their nurses was made. They also made a decision, based on the limited information that they had been provided and without speaking to any clinician or family member, that Erik's mental health need was more prominent than the sensory need. The CDC were still waiting for further information regarding the autism assessment in the Priory in August 2023, yet made no attempt to chase this up. I received evidence that escalations were made for specialist input for his sensory needs because it was identified without this it was likely to deteriorate and his risk increase. The OT referral was not accepted because of Erik's age and that whilst he was signposted to adult services these would only assist when he was 18 because there was a commissioning gap. Following escalation to the ICB specific funding was put in place for access to the sensory hive for Erik but the initial appointment only occurred on 22 September 2023 and Erik was found deceased in the back garden of his home 8 days following this.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - I was provided with evidence that the OT referral made to the Child Development Centre in Warrington was not accepted because Erik was 17 years old and they were only commissioned to age 16. I was informed that there was no provision in commissioning for new OT referrals for sensory needs and that he was signposted to possible adult services although these would only accept him once he was 18. A gap in the commissioning and support for these high risk individuals was identified. 6

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on . The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide The cause of death was established as: I a Hanging (suspension by a ligature around the neck),"Ash Bannister was a 16 year old who was assigned female at birth but became gender neutral, Ash wanted to be referred to as “they” or “their”. Ash was born in Croydon in 2004 and had a very difficult start to life. Ash first became known to social services in 2005 after concerns were raised about Ash being exposed to drug use in the family home, [REDACTED] and physical abuse. Ash was subject to a Child Protection Plan and ultimately placed into foster care in 2006 due to concerns about neglect and the misuse of drugs at home. Ash remained looked after until 2007 when Ash returned to her father's care. Social care became involved again when Ash was around 10 or 11 years old. In January 2018 Ash's family confirmed they were no longer able to manage Ash at home and keep the rest of the family safe, Ash was therefore to move into a residential placement. Ash remained in residential care until she died on 7 August 2021. Ash was involved with multiple agencies throughout life and was a child with complex needs. Ash had multiple vulnerabilities including early neglect, a difficult childhood, the fact Ash was a looked after child, a history of exposure to Child Sexual Exploitation, mental health difficulties and a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder along with some potential difficulties around eating and exploration of their gender identity. Ash was first referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (“CAMHS”) in around 2009 or 2010 at the age of 5 or 6 whilst living in Croydon. Ash had a long history of self-harming, this started at a very early age (9 years old) and was a theme throughout Ash's short life. Ash experienced both auditory and visual hallucinations. Ash would hear a male voice which told Ash that they were worthless, the voice would belittle Ash and encouraged self-harming. Ash was found hanging [REDACTED] at the residential care home (which was run by United Children's Services) where they lived on 7 August 2021. Ash was confirmed dead at 0922hrs by East Midlands Ambulance Service.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Risk Assessments I heard evidence to confirm that Ash was subject to a Ligature Risk Assessment which was put into place after Ash ligatured in December 2020, at that time the Risk was deemed to be a “medium” risk. The Ligature Risk Assessment was reassessed in April 2021 at which time the risk level was lowered to “low”. I heard evidence to confirm that at some point between the April 2021 review and Ash's death a decision to remove Ash's personal Ligature Risk Assessment was made. United Children's Services were unable to tell me the date on which the decision to remove Ash's Ligature Risk Assessment was made because there is no documentation relating to the date on which that decision was made or the reasons why that decision was made. This lack of documentation is a grave concern. Ash died on 7 August 2021 from 1a) Hanging (suspension placing a ligature around the neck) there was no personal Ligature Risk Assessment in place at the time of death. Documentation and communication I heard evidence to confirm there was no documentation created by United Children's Services to detail the date on which Ash's Ligature Risk Assessment was deemed to be no longer required or to explain the rationale behind the making of that decision. There is no documentation to explain or justify the deviation from Ash's care plan on the morning that Ash died. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 Further, the Court heard evidence to confirm that there was little or no communication of Ash's historic Child Sexual Exploitation risk between the two United Children's Services care homes when Ash moved from The Oaks to The Laurels in July 2020. Lack of documentation and poor communication is a concern. Waking Night Cover I heard evidence to confirm that Ash had consumed alcohol on the evening of 5 August 2021. Due to appropriate concerns about the consumption of alcohol when on anti-psychotic medication staff at the residential care home implemented an “ad hoc” waking night process, this means that a member of staff remained outside Ash's bedroom door and awake all night. During the waking night period Ash went into the lavatory and made what are described as “superficial” cuts to her neck, a blade was later removed from Ash. The next day, on 6 August 2021, staff described Ash as having a good day. Ash went to bed as normal at around 2150hrs. There was no ad hoc waking night cover implemented. Ash was not checked on from the time Ash went to bed at 2150hrs until 0900hrs on the 7 August 2021, a period of 11 hours. During those 11 hours Ash ended their life. Ash was found hanging at 9am on 7 August 2021. The decision to implement ad hoc waking night cover is not a decision which is governed by policy at United Children's Services. I heard evidence to confirm that the decision is based upon the gut instinct of the staff on duty at the time. The fact there is no policy to specifically deal with ad hoc waking nights means the decision making around the same will not be consistent and therefore the level of care provided to the children in the care of United Children's Services is heavily dependent on which staff member is on duty at the time that the care is needed. Further, there is no step down process to wean children off ad hoc waking night cover. In Ash's case Ash went from having a staff member outside her door throughout the night from 5 to 6 August 2021 to having a period of 11 hours where Ash was entirely unsupervised throughout the night from 6 to 7 August 2021. It was during those 11 unsupervised hours that Ash ended their life. Compliance with care and support plans Ash had a “support plan” and I was told in evidence that support plans contain “crucial” information relating to residents. Ash's support plan stipulated that Ash was to be checked on every morning at 7am. Ash was not checked upon at 7am on the morning of her death, this is a breach of Ash's support plan. There was nothing documented in any of the records disclosed to the Court to explain why the support plan was deviated from on this occasion. I was told by care home workers that they would not expect to check on a teenager at 7am at the weekend in a normal family home. The residential care home where Ash was living was not a normal family home but a therapeutic home for children with complex needs. The evidence from the Operations Manager at United Children's Services who run the home was that Ash should have been checked on at 7am. Ash's support plan was incorrectly deviated from without any documentation, explanation or justification as to why. This should not have happened. Staff training The Court heard evidence from one member of staff who worked at a United Children's Services Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 care home for a period of 4.5 months and did not know what Child Sexual Exploitation was. The Court heard evidence to confirm that new staff members have 6 months to complete all of their training meaning it is possible to have staff members working with children with complex needs and vulnerabilities who do not have a full understanding of the spectrum of their needs due to not having completed all of their training yet. United Children's Services Investigation policy and process I heard evidence to confirm that United Children's Services do have an investigations policy, albeit that document was not disclosed to the Court despite a request for confirmation as to whether any internal investigation of any kind was undertaken and confirmation of what investigatory processes were available to United Children's Services to use after Ash's death. I heard conflicting evidence at the inquest in relation to whether an investigation was undertaken by United Children's Services after Ash's death. I was told (1) there was no internal investigation but they did feed into the Local Authority's Safeguarding Investigation and (2) there was an investigation undertaken by United Children's Services but the outcome of the investigation was not documented. I heard evidence from the Operations Manager at United Children's Services to confirm that the investigation which took place after Ash's death but which was not formally documented was discussed at the United Children's Service's Board Meeting around 6 or 7 months post death. Ash died in August 2021, the Board Meeting will therefore have taken place in or around February or March 2022. I heard evidence to confirm that the required changes to the United Children's Services investigation policy and process were discussed at the Board Meeting but that at the time of the inquest, 2 years and 1 month after the Board Meeting and 2 years and 8 months after Ash's death, those changes had “not yet” been made. I asked why changes had not been made and was told that United Children's Services wanted to get the inquest process “out of the way” before making any changes. I have grave concerns about the fact that United Children's Services have been running homes in the knowledge that they have an inadequate investigation process in place for over two years. Significant learning came to light at the inquest which United Children's Services were not aware of before the inquest. It was accepted by United Children's Services that their investigation policy and process was not fit for purpose because it failed to identify all of the learning arising from Ash's death. If an investigation was undertaken by United Children's Services after Ash's death it: (1) Was not documented; (2) Failed to identify all of the learning uncovered at the inquest; (3) Failed to trigger any changes at United Children's Services. The investigation process in place at United Children's Services is therefore not fit for purpose. Policies and processes at United Children's Services in general I have concerns about policies and processes in place at United Children's Services, including the investigations policy, the policies governing risk assessments, in particular the ligature risk assessment, and the ad hoc waking nights process. I heard evidence at the inquest about United Children's Service's plan to make, what appear on the face of it, to be broad and wide-reaching changes to their policies and processes. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 However, at the time of writing this report those changes have not been discussed, finalised, implemented or embedded. The children in the care of the United Children's Services will, in my opinion, remain at risk until such time as appropriate and effective action is taken and the necessary changes are implemented and embedded at the company and within their care homes. 6"

The Rt Hon James Cleverly MP, Secretary of State for the Home Office (Border Force)",On 6 December 2023 an investigation into the death of Dr Jonathan Harvey Shaw was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 April 2024. I recorded a conclusion of Suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) fatal nitrite/nitrate toxicity.,"Dr Jonathan Shaw took his own life through the intentional ingestion [REDACTED] which he had procured through an online purchase from a company that operates in Malaysia. Before the package [REDACTED] was delivered to Dr Shaw, it had been stopped by UK Border Force at the request of the National Fast Parcel Targeting Team who received intelligence about the Malaysian company and information about concerns for Dr Shaw's welfare and the risk to life. Officers from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) made contact with Dr Shaw and informed him that the parcel had been stopped by UK Border Force. There is no evidence that the officers were informed by UK Border Force of the timescales before release and the officers would most likely not have been aware that UK Border Force could only lawfully keep hold of the package for 30 days. UK Border Force released the package 9 days after its arrival in the UK and without examining its contents or consulting with GMP. The lack of consultation with GMP represented a significant missed opportunity as the evidence was that Dr Shaw would most likely have agreed to the safe destruction of the package if he had been asked at a point before he took physical possession of it. In the event, Dr Shaw concealed the package and informed his family, the police and mental health professionals that he had disposed of it. He subsequently used the contents of the package to end his life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows:- The UK Border Force do not have the legal powers to seize a consignment of because it is not a prohibited poison under the Poisons Act 1972. If there is an ongoing police investigation or police interest in a particular consignment, the UK Border Force can use section 19 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to stop and hold. However the holding power is limited to 30 days, after which the consignment must be released. There is no national guidance or training provided to Police Forces or the UK Border Force on joint working around the management of consignments of from overseas which have been ordered by individuals inside the UK for the purpose of ending their own life. There is no legal requirement to alert the local police force before a consignment is released or to request a welfare check during which the recipient could be invited to agree to the safe destruction of the parcel by the police or UK Border Force. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6th March 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Drug & Alcohol Related. The medical cause of death was; 1a Cardiac Arrhythmia 1b Chronic Excess Alcohol Consumption and Use Of Amphetamine. I found at inquest, Stevyn Carr died on 16th November 2021 at 17 Lytchfeld, Leam Lane, Gateshead from a cardiac arrhythmia caused by the toxic effects of him voluntarily consuming a quality of alcohol and amphetamines at some point prior to his death. His intention in doing so was not to end his life.","Stevyn Carr contacted Northumbria Police on the evening of 15th November 2021 at 7.22pm. His contact with police call handlers and emergency operators was difficult to understand, due to on balance to his intoxication. He did ask for 'Help' and he was told police would attend. The calls to police were assessed a Grade 2 response – normally within an hour. No police attended until they entered Stevyn Carr's address at 12.02pm on 16th November after members of his family contacted the police at 10.38am to express their concerns for him. He was discovered dead when police entered his home. On the evidence heard it was not possible to ascertain whether earlier police attendance would have altered the outcome. From the first call to police to his discovery by police a period of 16 hours 40 minutes elapsed.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The evidence I heard at inquest indicated the level of police response should have been classed as a Grade 2 Vulnerable to ensure a more timely response. (2) No oversight of the incident took place for over 9 hours and at that a comment was made that there were no resources able to attend, but no other options/alternatives were pursued. (3) The family of Stevyn Carr contacted police some 15 hours after the first call to the police and after this a further 1 hour and 23 minutes elapsed before police went to his address and found him. (4) I heard evidence at inquest that a number of incidents were 'delayed' for a significant period for lack of police resources and this position was common place at that time. (5) I have asked for evidence to satisfy me that the position in terms of police attendance has improved both within the area Stevyn Carr died, but across the Northumbria Police force area. The evidence I have received is difficult to interpret and not comprehensive. I am concerned whether the changes to the management of incidents and/or training in relation to the grading of incidents by Northumbria Police has improved since Stevyn Carr's death, to the extent that the timeliness of police response to requests from the public for assistance is improved and is improving. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9th October 2023. The overall conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion which stated that: “ At some time between the 15th April and 23rd April 2021 Axel, who had recently turned 18 years old tied a ligature [REDACTED]. It cannot be determined if at the time he had intended to end his own life. On 22nd February 2021 Axel had an unplanned discharged from Hospital, following his arrest by Police, at a time when he was showing signs of a decline in his mental health. The agencies failed him in that:- The Mental Health services failed to arrange a coherent planned discharge on 22nd February 2021 and provide a clear risk, crisis, and care plan on discharge.Adult Social Care failed to arrange a capacity assessment upon his discharge on 22nd February 2021 or anytime thereafter.There was lack of consideration by all agencies involved with Axel as to whether the accommodation provided to him was suitable for a young person, whose capacity fluctuated when in crisis, and who in those circumstances became unsafe to live alone.Axel ' s lead Practitioner failed to assertively engage with Axel after discharge and meet with him in person. She was therefore not able to assess his ongoing risk or recognise his mental health deterioration.On 6th April 2021 following an obvious decline in Axel ' s mental health presentation there was a failure by Adult Social Care staff to arrange a full risk assessment and mental health review.There was a lack of support and active engagement for Axel provided by the Adult Assessment and Treatment Service in Crawley pending his transfer to Adult Assessment and Treatment Service in Brighton. Axel ' s death was contributed to by neglect ”","At some time between the 15th April and 23rd April 2021 Axel, who had recently turned 18 years old tied a ligature [REDACTED}. Axel had recently been detained under Section 2 Mental Health Act 1983 but discharged following a violent incident in the hospital when he was taken into Police custody. He was released from Police custody into temporary accommodation in Brighton provided by Adult Social Care.","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: This case identified that there is a lack of clear understanding of the risk or accountability between the agencies when a young person transitions from CAMBS services at the age of 18 to adult services. The expert who provided evidence in this case said that this was a well-recognised problem and whilst services across the country had tried to address this, there was a lack of national guidance and provision. In this particular case Axel was particularly vulnerable. He was born Yasmin Price but identified as a male from a young age. He had struggled emotionally during his teens and had indulged with alcohol and drugs. He had been detained on a number of occasions due to his mental health. At the age of 18 he transitioned to adult services but there was a lack of a recognised pathway for him. In the lead up to his death he had been discharged from a mental health provision following his arrest for criminal offences. He was then discharged from the hospital and subsequently the Police station to temporary accommodation. There was little shared understanding between agencies of how Axel should best be supported and therefore he appeared to fall between the services. Substantial changes have been made locally by Sussex Partnership Foundation NHS Trust around the transition of those from CAMBS to Adult health services but looking at other Prevention of Future Death Reports this is not just a local issue. There is a lack of national guidance and support in relation to the multi-agency approach that is needed to support those young people transitioning to adult health and social care services. Unless this is addressed nationally, sadly other deaths will occur. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 March 2024. The conclusion at the end of the inquest was that Scott Rider died as the result of: Suicide,"Scott Rider was a prisoner at HMP Woodhill, serving a sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection. This was a sentence of indeterminate length. The minimum tariff was 23 months. Scott had been in prison for 17 and a half years at his time of death. Scott was transferred to HMP Woodhill on 30th June 2021 and after leaving the induction unit he was moved to House Unit 4A. He had been self- isolating for over 200 days. He was supported by members of staff to the best of their capacity under the circumstances, but did not always engage. There was no outward indication prior to Scott's death that he had an increased risk of suicide at that time. Scott's aim was to be transferred to another prison in the North. At the time of Scott's death, there were inadequate staffing levels and the continuing length of his sentence was uncertain. On the 13th June 2022, Scott was found hanging in his cell with a ligature around his neck.","During the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 One of the findings of the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman was that Mr Rider was one of many IPP prisoners struggling to progress in his sentence and had limited hope for release. The Governor of the prison in her evidence to me, spoke about indeterminate sentences and said ""In my personal view they are indefensible"". She went on to say ""We find that some of the most challenging behaviours are from this group of men who feel trapped."" The governor also commented that if I were to submit a Regulation 28 report to the Minister for Prisons; ""most Prison Governors would welcome that intervention."" On the 9th September 2005 Mr Rider received an Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentence with a tariff of 23 months; at the time of his death he had served seventeen and half years and had given up all hope of release. On any consideration of the circumstances of Mr Rider's death one has to conclude that his treatment was inhumane and indefensible and that if action is not taken to review all prisoners sentenced to IPP then there is a risk of further deaths occurring. 6"

On 29 March he was bailed subject to conditions not to go within 100 metres of his home address where he lived with his partner, as a result of which, he started staying at the Travelodge, Rochdale. Mr Dow was on his own in a room at the Travelodge when at 18.35 on 2 April 2023 he made an emergency call to the ambulance service . He made contact with a call handler employed by NWAS.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 February 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was one of: Suicide The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Hypoxic Brain Injury 1b Asphyxiation 1c,"The Jury's answer given in the Record of Inquest to how, when and where the deceased came by his death was as follows: “Paul Templeton came by his death due to the termination of life support on 20th April 2023 at Ipswich Hospital.

Mr Paul Templeton's mental state deteriorated during 2022 to the point at which he was severely malnourished and dehydrated. This led to hospitalisation for kidney injury and later transferral to Woodlands under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. Initial and all subsequent assessments seriously fail to recognise that Paul's prolonged choice not to eat or drink were in fact indications of `action` to end his own life and therefore he should have been considered as a suicide risk.”","Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) In the words of the Jury: “Initial and all subsequent assessments seriously fail to recognise that Paul's prolonged choice not to eat or drink were in fact indications of 'action' to end his own life and therefore he should have been considered as a suicide risk.” Action is needed to prevent future failure to recognise (a) when the prolonged choice of a patient detained under the Mental Health Act not to eat or drink should be regarded as an action to end their own life; and (b) when such a patient's prolonged choice not to eat or drink should be recognised as elevating that patient's suicide risk (including of suicide by means other than malnourishment). At the conclusion of the Inquest, after the Jury had returned the completed Record of Inquest, I asked the Norfolk & Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust ('NSFT') to assist me with written information to inform me of what action is being taken to prevent future deaths related to the “serious failures” in risk assessment as to suicide risk identified by the Jury within their answer to how Mr Templeton died. I am grateful for the letter addressed to me, dated 29th February 2024, from the Deputy Chief Executive & Chief People Officer of NSFT. However, the contents of this letter did not allay my concern in this regard. The letter reiterated factual points that were substantially placed before the Jury in evidence. The letter then set out what appears in my view to be the central point that NSFT wished to make: “At no point prior to or during Mr Templeton's admission, did he present as a risk of self- harm or suicide other than through food or fluid restriction and on that basis there was no evidence to include previous history, recorded thoughts, ideation or plans to identify a risk of ligature. To implement a more restrictive environment upon Mr Templeton without evidence to do so would amount to a blanket restriction in breach of Regulations 13 and 17 of the Health and Social Care Act…” This response does not grasp, engage with, or show reflection in light of the Jury's finding. It therefore does not allay my concern that circumstances creating a risk of further deaths will occur, or will continue to exist, in the future. The Jury's finding was precisely that Mr Templeton did present as a risk of self-harm or suicide other than through food or fluid restriction – and that NSFT failed to recognise this risk as it was expressed by way of Mr Templeton choosing not to eat or drink. Although NSFT's letter argues that implementing a more restrictive environment without evidence to do so would amount to an impermissible blanket restriction, the Jury's finding was precisely that there was evidence (namely the prolonged choice not to eat and drink) that should have been recognised as being action taken to end his own life and therefore implying an elevated suicide risk. NSFT's letter goes on to draw my attention to three actions for improvement that are underway or in process. Firstly, “The inpatient clinical team to improve the quality and consistency of their psychological, food and fluid recording and discussions of the same within MDT recording.” While improved discussions regarding food and fluid recording might conceivably trigger recognition of when a refusal to eat or drink indicates suicidal ideation and action, merely recording and discussing food and fluid intake does not necessarily entail recognising when refusal to eat or drink reflects greater suicide risk. This action on its own does not appear to raise awareness among those conducting suicide risk assessments that a prolonged refusal to eat or drink may reflect an elevated suicide risk, as recognised by the Jury. It may be that review is required on the learning, training, and / or guidance given to assist those undertaking suicide risk assessments in relation to how they should interpret a prolonged refusal to eat or drink and the risk of suicide arising from such action. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Of course, it is not for the Coroner to recommend what action is required or to make specific remedial recommendations. Secondly, “The Community and Crisis team were identified as requiring improvement by ensuring routine weighing of patients to provide baseline and discussing and sharing the same…”. Thirdly, “The Crisis team was identified as requiring improvement in respect of ensuring physical health is monitored and considered within assessments…” Neither of these actions address the particular concern highlighted by the Jury's finding, not least as the serious failures identified by the Jury took place in Woodlands and not in the Community or Crisis teams. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 March 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: On the 29th June 2023 Daniela Vitalia Pani died at [REDACTED] after deliberately leaving the platform as a train approached and remaining on the tracks until she was struck by the train. She had suffered from a serious and enduring mental health problem for most of her adult life and was under the care of the mental health services at the time of her death,"Daniela had suffered from bi-polar affective disorder for many years. Over the course of 2022 her mental health deteriorated and she then came under the care of the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) and Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team (CRHTT); which are services provided by the Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. In May 2023 this culminated in her admission, as a voluntary patient, to an in-patient ward at Prospect Park Hospital. Daniela was discharged from Prospect Park Hospital on the 26 th June 2023 after her condition appeared to have stabilised. There was a care package in place for her in the community involving the CMHT and a care agency. On the 28 th June 2023 Daniela was due to have a review meeting with a member of the CMHT. This is known as a 72 hour review and is required due to the knowledge that there is a heightened risk to persons at periods of transition; such as discharge from an in-patient unit. Daniela telephoned the CMHT on that morning to say that she was unwell and to cancel the visit to her. The CMHT best practice guidance states that a 72 hour review should take place face to face and that telephone reviews should only be used as a rare exception once all avenues to arrange a face to face meeting have been exhausted. After speaking to her manager, the CMHT member undertook the 72 hour review meeting with Daniela via telephone on the 28 th June 2023. During this review Daniela denied that she had any intent to harm herself. Later that day Daniela twice called the CRHTT Crisis Line. The CRHTT nurse on duty reassured Daniela, carried out some safety planning and assessed Daniela as not posing an imminent risk to herself such that required an immediate intervention. On the 29 th June 2023 Daniela got a taxi to [REDACTED] and entered the station. As a train approached the platform shortly after 9.00am Daniela jumped onto the tracks and was struck by the train. The impact caused a severe head injury and Daniela was sadly declared deceased at the scene.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Concerns regarding the train station After Daniela's death British Transport Police (BTP) prepared a 'Post Incident Site Report'. I understand that this report was undertaken in conjunction with the station operator; in this case South Western Railways, and Network Rail. This report detailed a number of potential problems at and proposed mitigation measures. These included: 1. A lack of Samaritan signs on the platforms or within the stations. The mitigation proposed was conspicuously placed posters and/or additional signage. 2. Car park line side fencing being too low. The proposed mitigation was replacement of the fencing. The report was submitted on the 25th July 2023. Despite the passage of nearly 9 months from submission of the report to the date of the inquest the BTP officer giving evidence could not inform me whether these changes had been actioned. I was advised that this information had been requested from South Western Railways but had not been provided. On the 18th March 2024 I requested an update from BTP about the actions taken Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 and invited them to attend the final hearing on the 25th March 2024. No information was submitted and no-one from BTP attended the final hearing. I am therefore concerned that measures to mitigate the risk of future suicides at the train station have not been implemented. Concerns regarding the 72 hour review meeting I heard evidence from a number of members of the CMHT regarding the policies, procedures and training around the completion of this important review meeting. During the course of this I heard that training and guidance did not specifically address how to deal with service users declining a visit or meeting. This is a complex area with competing demands of the duty of care, mental capacity and the autonomy of an individual to make decisions about their own care and treatment. The evidence from the CMHT Joint Service Manager was that guidance and/or training would be important for staff seeking to deal with this challenging area. This gap had not been identified by the NHS Trust in their Serious Incident Report in 2023. Following the evidence at inquest the matter has been raised internally but no changes have yet been introduced. I am concerned that the staff not being able to carry out face to face assessments in all possible cases gives rise to the risk of future deaths. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 February 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion Ellen Ocean WOOLNOUGH was described by her family and friends as a caring, compassionate, thoughtful, kind and generous person who exuded warmth and charisma. A person whose company was uplifting and who had a genuine desire to see the lives of those around her enhanced. Ellie had a history of mental health issues which started when she was around six years of age. Ellie had contact with mental health services between 2001 to 2011 following which her contact was sporadic up until 2022. Her mental health continued to suffer through her adolescence and into her young adult years. She was diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder in April 2020. From 2019 Ellie's mental health problems became more acute when she suffered periods of physical illness, with particularly serious events identified in 2019 when she suffered from food poisoning and in May 2022 when she suffered from COVID. Although in May 2022 her physical symptoms were not severe, her mental health deteriorated significantly and she reported to her family that she attempted suicide by using a ligature on the 11th May 2022. She was seen the following day by the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team (CRHTT) and following assessment referred to the Integrated Delivery Team (IDT). On the 20th May 2022 Ellie met with IDT staff for the purposes of an assessment, however this was curtailed when Ellie left the meeting abruptly. A further meeting was not attempted and Ellie was discharged from the IDT a few days later. On the 19th July 2022 Ellie had been suffering from a gastrointestinal illness for several days. Her family were concerned both in relation to her physical wellbeing but also her mental health which had deteriorated due to her physical health condition. Ellie's father contacted her GP who referred Ellie to the CRHTT as an urgent referral. Ellie was spoken to by the CRHTT on two occasions around 17:30 hours following which arrangements were made for Ellie to be seen the following day (20th July 2022) by the CRHTT at her home. Concerned about her physical condition, her family called an ambulance who attended late on the evening of 19th July 2022 and treated Ellie at home for dehydration. Following a period of time spent at her parents that evening, Ellie returned to her home in the early hours of the 20th July 2022 and went to bed. From around 06:41 am until 09:21 am Ellie exchanged a series of text messages and phone calls with her father and partner which caused increasing concern for her welfare and resulted in her father and partner attending her residence. On gaining entrance they discovered Ellie suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Ambulance attended and following attempts at resuscitation, a return of spontaneous circulation was achieved and Ellie was transported to hospital. Sadly she had suffered an irreversible hypoxic brain injury and despite treatment Ellie died on the 28th July 2022. Ellen Ocean WOOLNOUGH took her own life whilst suffering from the diagnosed mental health condition of emotionally unstable personality disorder. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Hypoxic Brain Injury 1b Hanging",Narrative Conclusion see Box 4.,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. The adequacy of Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust's (NSFT) Integrated Delivery Team (IDT) decision making concerning the discharge of a patient from mental health services in circumstances where a failed engagement has occurred. 2. The adequacy of NSFT's Crisis Rehabilitation Home Treatment Team (CRHTT) response to an urgent referral, in particular; risk assessment, safety planning and decision making concerning the downgrading of referrals. 3. Adequacy of the NHS England Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF) to address serious incidents concerning patients and the implementation of this framework by NSFT. I received evidence from NSFT concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken to address my concerns. This evidence included the following: a. Care Group communication has improved across the Trust. b. Skills Training on Risk Management (STORM), covering suicide and self-harm awareness training, was being implemented across the Trust. c. Staff were being engaged concerning waiting lists and expectation management and how to present these to patients in a positive manner. d. The downgrade policy concerning crisis line referrals had been changed in 2023 to make the circumstances concerning a downgrade clearer and what was expected of nursing staff involved in these decisions. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 This evidence has not allayed my concerns. I remain concerned that many of the measures outlined by NSFT are prospective and have not been introduced. I note: i. STORM training continues to be rolled out, although the evidence from a number of witnesses questioned the effectiveness of the rollout in reaching all staff. ii. Whilst the downgrade policy concerning urgent referrals has been tightened up, key parts of the process, such as the handover document between shifts, is still to be introduced. iii. The Trust SOP addressing the downgrading of urgent referrals, which I was told was revised in 2023, has not been provided to the Court and has not been implemented by the Trust. iv. Changes to the way the Trust investigates incidents such as Ellie's, including the use of a screening tool to determine how the PSIRF process is implemented, the requirement to retain recordings of calls and which statements are to be taken to inform serious patient incident investigations, are still to be introduced by the Trust. v. The failure by NSFT to preserve important evidence, in the form of recordings of calls between Ellie and the NSFT crisis call handler, at a time when it was on notice that this evidence would be important and relevant for the conduct of the Inquest, remains a concern. 6"

Specifically, a misunderstanding about the Crisis Team visiting Ms Adams on the day of her discharge together with the provision of 5 days of prescribed medication to her likely made a more than minimal contribution to her death. The following care and service delivery issues possibly made a more than minimal contribution to Ms Adams' death: Delay by the mental health Trust in actioning the care plan on Ms Adams' discharge from the Crisis Team in October 2021, both in respect of allocating a Care Co-ordinator to her and in arranging an Out Patient Appointment and medication review;The mental health Trust's response to Ms Adams' deterioration in February and March 2022.","Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.","Mr Lyalushko took his own life by hanging, intending to end his life, on 2 January 2023. Mr Lyalushko died at his home address where he lived alone. My Lyalushko was a vulnerable young man with diagnoses of autistic spectrum disorder, anxiety, depression and agoraphobia. Mr Lyalushko was known to express suicidal ideation and had made suicide attempts. Mr Lyalushko had extensive involvement with mental health services throughout his life, including with Gedling Local Mental Health Team under Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust from August 2015 to August 2019, and from July 2020 to March 2022. A request for the involvement of Gedling Local Mental Health Team with Mr Lyalushko was sent to the service by Mr Lyalushko's General Practitioner on 22 November 2022. For reasons which have not been ascertainable, no action was taken in response to that request. Mr Lyalushko took his own life a little over a month later, there being no involvement of mental health services with him at the time of his death.

Inadequate review and incident investigation following a death Following Mr Lyalushko's death, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust completed an SI Review by way of case note review. Following evidence which considered the content of that review, the Trust stated that the review was 'insufficient in its current form and the scope should be broadened to include the concerns raised (during the inquest hearing).' The Trust said its Patient Safety Investigation Lead would undertake a new SI Review by 26 April 2024 (6 weeks). I identified a number of deficiencies with the initial SI Review which had been undertaken in respect of Mr Lyalushko: it did not identify that a request from Mr Lyalushko's GP in November 2022 for involvement of its service with Mr Lyalushko had not been actioned; it incorrectly identified areas where improvements were required as areas of good practice; and it did not involve any level of consultation with Mr Lyalushko's family to consider whether there were any areas of concern they had which might direct elements of the review. If there is insufficient review and learning from a death that, in my judgment, adds to the likelihood of future deaths occurring in similar circumstances. I am not reassured that necessary actions to address the serious issue identified i.e. inadequate initial review and incident investigation following a death, are yet in place. 6"

This questionnaire was not reviewed upon receipt.

An inquest into Mr Harris's death was opened on 21 July 2022. The inquest was resumed and concluded on 4 March 2024.

The medical cause of Mr Harris's death was:

1a. Suspension

2. Paranoid Schizophrenia

The inquest concluded as follows:

Suicide.

Jonathan Harris was 52 years old and had a diagnosis of Paranoid Schizophrenia.
On 24 November 2021 he was discharged following a lengthy psychiatric inpatient stay to Hazel Lodge, which provides supported living accommodation in Camberley and is run by Comfort Care Services Ltd.
At the time of his discharge from hospital Mr Harris was prescribed anti-psychotic medication in the form of a weekly depot injection of 600mg Zuclopentixol.
Whilst he was living at Hazel Lodge Mr Harris came under the care of his local community mental health team, the Surrey Heath Community Mental Health Recovery Service, which is part of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.
In early February 2022, following a request by Mr Harris, the frequency of his anti-psychotic medication was suitably reduced to 600mg fortnightly as opposed to weekly. Thereafter in early May 2022, following another request by Mr Harris, his anti-psychotic medication was further reduced to 600mg every three weeks. The reduction in his medication in May 2022 was premature and was made without exploring signs that Mr Harris appeared suspicious when he was seen by the mental health team on 4 May 2022 and in circumstances in which Mr Harris was known to have a significant life change ahead, namely a house purchase and move, which would entail him moving to a new community mental health team.
Thereafter, Mr Harris' mental health continued to deteriorate and on 24 June 2022 it was decided by the Community Mental Health Team that he required an assessment under the Mental Health Act. However, there was no inpatient bed available and therefore the assessment did not take place. Had the assessment taken place Mr Harris would have been detained under the Mental Health Act and admitted to hospital.
In the early hours of the morning of 27 June 2022 Mr Harris deliberately suspended himself [REDACTED], resulting in his death. In doing so he acted with the intention of taking his own life, albeit whilst suffering from a relapse of his paranoid schizophrenia.
Mr Harris would not have taken his own life had he remained well and the relapse of his Paranoid Schizophrenia materially contributed to his death. The relapse was precipitated by the initial reduction of his anti-psychotic medication in February 2022 and sped up and exacerbated by the further premature reduction in May 2022.
Mr Harris would not have died had an inpatient psychiatric hospital bed been available on either 24, 25 or 26 June 2022.",The circumstances of Mr Harris's death are set out in the above narrative conclusion.,The MATTER OF CONCERN is: The court heard that a Consultant Psychiatrist post in the community mental health team that treated Mr Harris has been vacant with no suitable applicants since 1 May 2022. The court heard that this is in the context of a national shortage of suitably qualified psychiatrists. The court also heard that there is an ongoing shortage of available inpatient psychiatric beds in Surrey and that this is in the context of a national shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds. The court is concerned that both of these matters present a risk of future deaths. 7

On 17th January 2024, the investigation was concluded: The medical cause of death given was: 1a. Suspension I recorded the following in Box 3 of the Record of Inquest: Sarah Louise Sutherland had significant mental health challenges with an ongoing history of suicidal ideation and self-harm. On the 17th December 2022, Ms Sutherland was found to have died by intention through self-suspension at her home address in Redhill having last been known to be alive on the 15th December 2022. I concluded Ms Sutherland died by way of Suicide","1. In 2017 Ms Sutherland was referred to NHS Mental Health Services with suicidal ideation and depression and until her death remained under the care of the Community Mental Health Recovery Service and in times of crisis the Home Treatment Team with a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 2. At the same time, Ms Sutherland sought the assistance of a private psychotherapist providing 'humanistic integrative' therapy and had twice weekly appointments from September 2017 until 2 days before her death 3. The psychotherapist kept no clinical records of the initial assessment or treatment throughout the five years on the grounds that this was not necessary, and it would contravene GDPR regulations with no change of practice following Ms Sutherland's death. 4. Throughout the five years as a client, Ms Sutherland's psychotherapist could not provide any evidence of ongoing analysis, evaluation, assessment or review of Ms Sutherland as to whether this psychotherapeutic approach was beneficial. Nor was there any any consideration as to whether alternative psychotherapeutic approaches would have been more beneficial to manage Ms Sutherland's mental health and other difficulties. 5. The psychotherapist was unable to adequately explain the benefit of 'humanistic integrative' psychotherapy for Ms Sutherland's underlying mental health difficulties. 6. The psychotherapist did not undertake any risk assessments as to whether the psychotherapeutic approach was appropriate (e.g. exploring 'trauma;') given the underlying diagnosis of EUPD with the knowledge of a long history of suicidal ideation and acts of self-harm. 7. The psychotherapist did not provide evidence of an agreed and appropriate therapeutic boundary or to appear to respect one given that Ms Sutherland was given regular access to walking her dogs and to bring treats for her cat outside of therapeutic sessions, leading to a real concern that Ms Sutherland had become dependent on the psychotherapist outside of a therapeutic relationship. 8. Whilst there are sensitivities involved with 'shared' care between a private and NHS service there was no useful communication either formally or informally from either party to ensure both knew what each were doing to work in Ms Sutherland's best interests with the psychotherapist being dismissive of so doing. 9. In the latter half of 2022 Ms Sutherland's mental health deteriorated requiring intensive treatment from the Home Treatment Team. Although there was some stabilisation in her mental health with a reduction in negative thoughts, Ms Sutherland ended her life shortly thereafter. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the people listed in paragraph 1 have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; I may extend that period on request. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 9 COPIES I have sent a copy of this report to the following: 1. See names in paragraph 1 above 2. 3.

The investigation concluded on the 29th January 2023 and the conclusion was one of Suicide . The medical cause of death was 1a) Hanging.,"Tobias Mannering-Jones was very vulnerable. He became homeless at the end of December 2022. He had no support network. He generally slept at the Hostel for homeless people in Tameside where he was exposed to abuse due to his sexuality, felt unsafe, and was in the company of people who were significantly greater users of hard drugs. He had mental health issues dating back to his childhood trauma that were greatly exacerbated by his homelessness. He increased his use of drugs to cope with his deteriorating situation, he was also sexually exploited. After he became homeless, he sought help for his spiralling situation. On 6th January he saw the mental health worker attached to his GP practice. Concerns regarding his vulnerability in the homeless accommodation were expressed. He spoke to that worker again on the 9th February at an appointment. His contacts with other agencies in the interim were not known of. He was also seen by Pennine Care Mental Health Liaison after he went to A&E on 15th January, 17th January and 14th February 2023. He indicated thoughts of self-harm with a key issue being his homelessness and the consequential impact on his mental health, drug use and support network exacerbated by the fact he had no telephone or address. He contacted CGL for help on 6th February 2023 to try and obtain help for substance misuse. Attempts to contact him for assessment were unsuccessful given his lack of a telephone. He was under the care of the neighbourhood mental health team and had been offered support from the Big Life Group previously. He was still awaiting assessment for therapy. Contact ceased with them, and they were not involved in planning how his discharges from the acute hospital would be managed in the community. Adult Social Care were contacted, by Tobias, asking for help on 8th February 2023. He was allocated a Social Worker on 14th February. Attempts to contact Tobias were unsuccessful due to his lack of telephone and homelessness. On 21st February 2023 Tobias was found [REDACTED] at Portland Basin Marina. Police found no suspicious circumstances. Post-mortem examination included toxicology. He was found to have evidence of limited cocaine use and alcohol use in the hours prior to his death. He had last been seen alive the afternoon before. No concerns for welfare had been raised following him last being seen. It is probable that had Tobias not been homeless, isolated and vulnerable and had there been a co-ordinated approach to supporting him he would not have taken his own life on 21st February 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest was told that Tobias had sought and had been referred for mental health support however due to the high demand and long waiting lists 2 he was still on a waiting list at the time of his death. The evidence before the inquest was that long delays were still an issue and were not restricted to Tameside but were part of a national picture of delays and long waiting lists for those seeking help with their mental health. 2. The inquest also heard evidence of the impact of homelessness and consequential vulnerability on a young person like Tobias and that the demands on Local Authorities meant that even where vulnerability was recognised there were not resources to offer sustained support and stable housing solutions. The evidence was that as a consequence young vulnerable people had to rely on homeless shelters where they were exposed to additional negative influences and as in Tobias's case abuse due to their sexuality. 3. Evidence was also heard that a person who has to rely on a homeless shelter can then become uncontactable to public service providers as they have no address for contact which means they then have even less chance of accessing support. 4. The inquest was told that young adults who are homeless are often sexually exploited and that those who identify as LGBTQIA can be particularly vulnerable and that the underlying vulnerability and risk was not always appreciated by those dealing with young homeless people and that it could be mistaken by agencies as a lifestyle choice rather than what it actually was, i.e., exploitation by an older adult. 5. The evidence before the inquest was that where multiple agencies were involved it was fundamental that one agency/person took overall ownership/responsibility to ensure a coordinated and effective approach using regular MDTs to understand the information that all agencies had in their possession and to offer effective support. 6"

The pharmacy confirmed in evidence that this had been dispensed as a full pack in accordance with its special container status. Jason was prescribed his medication in weekly doses due to a history which included previous attempts to take an overdose of his medication. Jason received this full pack of tablets only 17 days before taking an overdose of this medication on 6th September 2022. The pharmacy also confirmed that another patient at the practice received the same medication in a 7-day monitored dosage system (MDS) but could not confirm whether the remaining pack was then disposed of for that patient. I am concerned that, due to a special container status, a box of tablets of Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (clopixol) must be dispensed in its own special container as a full pack of tablets (original pack dispensing) and that this can endanger the safety of a patient with a history of suicidal risk and previous overdose attempts.

Adrian suffered with Antisocial and Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorders, complicated by depression and substance misuse. He had attempted to take his own life on multiple occasions. He had been more settled in recent years, but his suicidal risk remained high.

In the last months of his life, he was under the care of community mental health services, primary care network (PCN) and was being treated with structured psychological support.

From April 2021, building works at his residence exacerbated his paranoia and from 8th June 2021 this manifested as repeated crisis contact with emergency and psychiatric services- more than 25 occasions up to his death from 8th June 2021.

Twice during this time, he was detained on section 136 and then discharged following Mental Health Act Assessment to his usual community care.

His care was reviewed daily from 9th June 2021 in PCN meetings, and he was supported by crisis contact, including a home visit when he failed to respond to welfare check calls.

On 25th June 2021 he was engaging in a structured psychological support session with a psychiatrist, when police attended to check on him following concerns raised about suicidality from a member of the public.

Shortly after police left, he was heard to be screaming and then seen to be hanging off the balcony on the 4th floor of his block of flats. He was seen to let go and fall to his death.

At all assessments in the last weeks of his life he had presented with paranoid ideation and with a background risk of suicide, but no increased intent to take his own life.

It is likely that his death was due to an impulsive act on his part whilst suffering distress due to paranoia as part of his illness.

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death:

He took his own life whilst suffering severe and enduring mental illness","Despite the obvious deterioration in his paranoia there was no evidence heard that medication was actively considered to help alleviate, this except in hindsight.

Home Treatment Team Care (First Response Team) had been considered on 15th June 2021 as part of his assessment by the AMHP, but there is no evidence in his notes from CNWL, that this was considered after this time, despite further crisis contact.

Adrian was undoubtedly a complex patient to treat, but when he deteriorated, his treatment sessions were left with the specialist doctor in training and he did not receive assessment by the psychiatric consultant in the community, who in fact never met him, either before he started the structured psychological treatment or when he deteriorated.

When the police interrupted his last treatment session, the psychiatrist did not try and call Adrian back to ask how he was and to re- assess his risk, despite the number of crisis contacts, his paranoia with associated distress, his known high background risk of suicide, his risk of impulsivity, emotional instability, and his very recent s136 detentions etc. The doctor discussed what had happened with the team and it was decided to wait and see if police contacted psychiatric services rather than re contact the patient, taking reassurance from police presence, despite police officers wishing to talk to doctor and requesting telephone contact numbers but being unable to secure these before the signal on the call between police and psychiatrist failed. Adrian's phone number was available to the doctor and the PCN team. Police officers are not mental health clinicians.

The court found that the lack of re contact with Adrian by the psychiatrist after the treatment session was interrupted, was a failure in care.

Police did try and call SPA but hung up after being told that they were 4th in the queue as they expected a wait of hours before being answered at that time.

Police did arrange a follow up visit for Adrian by the police night shift. Adrian had declined LAS attendance and refused a lift from the officers to St Thomas's Hospital.

However, Adrian had come from the balcony about an hour after the police left.

Police systems have now changed, and Adrian would now be checked by health care rather than police. SPA answer times have also improved.

It was not until the final witness, who was from the PCN, did the level of consideration and care being given by the PCN become apparent. Both the treating consultant and the PCN Service Lead noted the lack of formal regular input from the treating consultant's team to the PCN MDT.

Whilst it could not be said that the matters outlined above contributed to the death on the facts of this case, concerns remain.

This report has also been sent to NHS England, so that the lessons learned from this death may be applied to mental health care services."

The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of: Suicide, resulting directly from a lack of Mental Health bed provision in Suffolk and nationally. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Traumatic asphyxia 1b Hanging","Nicola Raynor was verified as deceased at 19:43 on 10th June 2023, at the Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire. On the 6th June 2023 Nicola had been found hanging [REDACTED]. The emergency services attended, and Nicola was taken to Addenbrookes Hospital where she subsequently passed away as the result of a hypoxic brain injury. Nicola had a history of poor mental health, and at the time of her death was under the care of the Mental Health Services. Prior to Nicola being found hanging on the 6th June 2023, she had earlier that day attended a consultation with a psychiatrist, who had wanted to admit Nicola to a Mental Health ward immediately, however no beds were available. Nicola had a few days earlier (on 29th May 2023), also been seen by a Mental Health Nurse at the local Accident and Emergency department, who had also wanted to immediately admit Nicola into hospital, but due to Bank Holiday pressures, again no bed had been available. At the time of her death Nicola had been placed on a waiting list to be admitted to hospital, but due to non-availability locally, or nationally, admission was not possible. Had a Mental Health bed been available on the 6th June 2023, Nicola's death would not have occurred.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern.

I am therefore concerned in relation to the overall bed capacity for those patients like Nicola seeking informal inpatient admission. Nicola's case is not an isolated one. Evidence was heard from the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust, that on the day of the inquest itself (23rd February 2024), the availability of bed provision for informal Mental Health patients had failed to improve at all. The court heard that on the 23rd February 2024, the Operational Pressure Escalation Level was at its highest level (Four Black) and that at time of Nicola's inquest, in Suffolk alone, there were 20 patients on a list waiting for an informal inpatient Mental Health bed. The court heard, that just as on the 6th June 2023, there were no other available informal Mental Health beds anywhere else in the country. The facts of Nicola's case mirror those of another tragic Suffolk case, for which I produced a Prevention of Future Death Report in October 2020. I am therefore concerned, that any measures that may have been taken in the intervening period since October 2020, have neither adequately, or effectively, addressed this clear and continuing local and national risk of future deaths occurring. 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical cause of death being: 1a multiple traumatic injuries","On 24 September 2023, Sandra Senior travelled to central London. While there she gained access to Tavistock Chambers, Bloomsbury, WC1A; a building comprising of commercial units on the ground floor, with four floors of residential accommodation above. [REDACTED] completed suicide [REDACTED]","During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) The London Borough of Camden Council is the Freeholder of Tavistock Chambers. I learned in evidence from local witnesses and officers from the Metropolitan Police Service that Miss Senior's death, as a result of using to complete suicide, was the second of its type within approximately 18-months. The evidence from a resident of one of the flats in Tavistock Chambers set out that the only access to the residential part of the building is through a door , which has “a secure key fob entry system”. However, the evidence was that “We have constant issues with this front entrance either not locking or not opening with the key, there is also a latch to hook the door open at times”. The witness confirmed that the front entrance was hooked open at the material time; this was confirmed by photographic evidence provided by the Metropolitan Police Service. There was also evidence that approximately a year prior to the events of 24 September 2023, “Camden Council locked the only access .” The witness had assumed that it remained bolted and locked. However, other evidence, including photographic evidence from the Metropolitan Police Service, showed that although there was a clear 'no entry' sign , it was not locked shut. A statement from a Detective Sergeant revealed, “A yellow padlock was locked onto the sliding bolt, to give an illusion it was locked, however the clasp had not been held down into the lock, so it could have been opened by any person.” It was also established in evidence that Miss Senior did know any of the residents of Tavistock Chambers or in the vicinity generally. As such, it appeared that her entry to the building was entirely opportunistic. However, that aside, the evidence suggested that both of the safety systems installed to prevent unauthorised access to the building were not working effectively at that time. The concern is that it appears that the safety systems in place to stop unauthorised access in particular, were not operating/being used effectively at the material time and the evidence suggests that this may have been commonplace. 6"

The Chief Executive, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 1","On the 24th January 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Kenneth Stanley Baylis. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 26th January 2024 The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Mr Baylis took his own life on 23rd January 2023 whilst on unescorted leave, when he was an informal inpatient on Kingsley Ward of Millbrook Mental Health Unit. He had a history of depression, and repeated serious and escalating suicide attempts over a fourteen month period leading up to his death. His risk of suicide was real and imminent throughout his final admission from 28.12.22. This was not properly recognised by the treating team with responsibility for his care, due to a failure to involve his family in risk assessment and support and safety planning, a failure to follow procedures regarding unescorted leave for informally admitted patients, and a failure to properly weigh up all the relevant factors which contributed to suicidal risk. The decision on the 10th January 2023, to allow unescorted leave from the ward, was not an appropriate one. All these omissions in care made a more than minimal, negligible, or trivial contribution to his death","Mr Baylis took his own life [REDACTED] on 23.1.23. He died from multiple injuries. He did so with the intention of his actions leading to his death. He made four previous serious and escalating attempts to end his life from November 2021, until finally succeeding on 23rd January 23 – this was despite caring support from his family and from many of the mental health professionals that he met both as an inpatient and when supported by the community teams. Sadly, however the building picture of increasing risk of suicide was not fully understood by the team on Kingsley ward. During Mr Baylis's final inpatient psychiatric admission, the seriousness and his intent to die, were significantly underestimated. There was inadequate risk assessment during this last admission, lacking in detail and incomplete. His repeated reporting of lack of suicidal thoughts, and intentions was not adequately challenged. Risk assessment was also severely compromised because there was with no contact made with the family until 12.1.23, and no family involvement in key decisions made by the team. Mr Baylis was a voluntary patient during his final admission, and was allowed unescorted leave, on 10.1.23, which gave him the opportunity to take his own life. This should not have occurred. Had there been family involvement in the decisions regarding leave arrangements, had there been greater weight given to the repeated, and very recent, very serious suicide attempts, together with more direct involvement requested of the Specialist Depression service, it is unlikely that this incorrect decision would have been made. Accepting that it would have been difficult to deny him his unescorted leave request, (as this was his wish, and he was an informal patient), had he been told this was not agreed, it would have likely precipitated either a further Mental Health Act assessment, or more likely his agreement to comply, as had occurred in previous admissions. This would have allowed for a longer treatment period, hopefully (if it had been considered) family participation in his care and support plan, as previously, further involvement of the Specialist Depression service, with a more robust management plan, that acknowledged that depression was the most likely explanation for his presentation, and a managed discharge to a safer environment. The lack of family input during his final admission, to Mr Baylis's risk assessment and support and safety planning, together with the serious under estimation of the real and imminent risk of death from suicide, and the incorrect decision to allow unescorted leave, all probably made a more than minimal, negligible, or trivial contribution to his death. Trust Policies and procedures regarding family involvement in assessment of risk, care plans, and MDT meetings, were not followed. The Trust procedure entitled 'Care Planned Leave/Time off the ward for inpatient areas of the mental health services division', was not followed. There was no evidence of joint planning of leave arrangements, to include family, very limited evidence of consideration of identified risks, very limited consideration of any possible leave restrictions, and no contact with family to ask them if they had any concerns about leave arrangements. Additionally, and importantly, there was no clear evidence of an assessment of Mr Baylis's mental state, nor a robust assessment of risk, before each period of time off the ward. There is no evidence of completion of the sheet- 'Appendix 1 of the Planned Leave procedure : Time Spent off the ward' at any time. Had it been completed it would have captured a signature of the staff member allowing Mr Baylis to leave, details of his time leaving the ward, planned time of return, planned destination, actual time of return. This sheet was not a familiar document to the senior treating team on Kingsley ward. Detailed findings as to how he came by his death are described within a written Determination dated 4.8.23, appended to this report.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows – 1. Family are not routinely or regularly involved in a patients risk assessment, care plan and safety planning. 2. Inadequate suicidal risk assessment and suicide mitigation 3. Lack of compliance with the Trusts Planned Leave policy. 4. Inadequate review and incident investigation following a serious suicide attempt or a death I am not reassured that necessary actions to address these serious issues identified are in place. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, conducted before a jury, on 06 February 2024. The jury returned a narrative conclusion.","Daniel (referred to as Dan at the request of his family) was detained pursuant to s.2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 on Saturday 9th April 2022 and admitted to Redwood 1, Highbury Hospital, Nottingham the following day. He had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) and a long history of mental ill health, including multiple instances of self-harm and suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Following a period of relative stability, he presented at A&E on 5th April 2022 after an episode of deliberate self-harm. He disclosed suicidal thoughts. He was referred to the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team that day but was detained on 9th April after disclosing that he had not only an intention but a plan to end his life, details of which he declined to disclose. Due to previous negative experiences on Redwood 1, Dan requested a move to another ward. He declined nearly all attempts by staff to engage with him and was consistently described as low in mood, very withdrawn and largely confining himself to his bedroom. He was physically (though not formally) discharged following a Ward Round on 22nd April 2022. A clinical psychologist present at that Ward Round gave evidence that she raised concerns that his mental state and demeanour were not conducive to imminent discharge. Dan left Highbury Hospital at around 17:55 that day. At approximately 20:30, he ingested a lethal quantity of [REDACTED] which he purchased [REDACTED] prior to his detention and admission to Redwood 1. The jury found the following failings in Dan ' s care (the first four of which were admitted) contributed to his death: More should have been done to try and effect the move from Redwood 1 to another hospital/ward in line with Dan ' s wishes. There was a failure to allocate a Named Nurse and/or a failure of the allocated named nurse to carry out a 1:1 session with Dan during his admission. There was a lack of exploration in the Ward Round on 22 April 2022 and/or a lack of documentation of an exploration in the Ward Round of the “ plan ” that Dan had to end his life before his admission. There was a failure by ward staff to hand over information regarding a threat to ligate (noted in the handover sheet from 20 April 2022) to the Ward Round on the 22 April 2022. A failure to record and take appropriate action following significant risk-related incidents (Daniel expressing an intention to self-harm) which occurred during Dan ' s admission. A failure to take proper account of all available relevant information concerning Dan ' s risk when assessing his risk prior to discharge. The jury also found the following failings (the first three of which were admitted) but did not find these to have contributed to Dan ' s death: A failure to update Dan ' s ward specific Care Plan and Risk Assessment documentation in RIO during his admission. Dan had a Crisis Care Plan developed in August 2018 and updated in January 2019. There was a failure to update it in preparation for his discharge on 22 April 2022. A failure to adequately discuss Dan's risk with Dan's carer prior to discharge. A failure by the Trust to engage adequately with Dan ' s family and/or carers either during his admission on Redwood 1 and/or at the point of discharge. The inquest heard evidence that Dan had openly discussed his plans to end his own life on a chat forum of the [REDACTED] while detained at Highbury Hospital. It appears he also obtained information on [REDACTED] as a method of suicide and where to source it, from that site. [REDACTED]","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The following matters of concern are directed to NHCT for response ­ Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 1. A continuing practice/culture of minimising the importance of a ward specific risk assessment and care plan I am concerned that, notwithstanding the existence of a clear, appropriate policy and significant commendable actions by the Trust since Daniel's death to address this issue, there remain clinical and nursing staff who do not fully recognise or accept the importance of completing and utilising the required risk assessment and care plan. This suggests there may be a persisting training or cultural issue. The inquest heard evidence that there was (and remains) a clear and robust policy in place which most staff were aware of. This requires a care plan and risk assessment be initiated upon a patient's admission, completed within 72 hours of admission and updated as necessary during admission. Further, since Dan's death, the Trust has gone to considerable and commendable lengths to ensure that care plans and risks assessments are in place in every case and to reinforce the requirements of this guidance within the Nursing team; that team hold primary (but not sole) responsibility for creating and updating the risk assessment and care plan document. I also heard that a recent audit found that all current patients had an appropriate care plan in place. The Ward Manager agreed this is “a basic and fundamental part” of any patient's care. In spite of all of this, an experienced ward nurse and two psychiatrists (a consultant and a registrar) involved in Dan's care seemed to minimise the practical importance of the required process and documentation, the latter both suggesting they would not routinely consult it. 2. Inadequate system of allocating a named nurse to patients and recording the same I am concerned that, notwithstanding the existence of a clear, appropriate policy requiring the same, the current system of allocating a named nurse and ensuring patients receive regular and effective 1:1 sessions with them are inadequate. I am also concerned that no record is kept of the named nurse appointed to each patient, thus (as in this case) hindering any investigation where issue around the role and actions of that person arises. The General Manager of Adult Mental Health at the Trust helpfully and frankly acknowledged that the evidence heard at inquest raised questions about the adequacy of the existing system, of which he was not previously aware of. It remains unclear whether Daniel was appointed a Named Nurse who failed to perform that role effectively, or whether there was a failure to appoint such a nurse at all. The General Manager's view was that under the existing system, it is possible that a named nurse was appointed without their knowledge. While the Ward Manager gave evidence that she would have no confidence Daniel would have known who his named nurse was, even if one was appointed. The inquest heard evidence that named nurse sessions with Daniel during previous admissions had been important opportunities for engagement with staff and had elicited a substantial amount of information pertinent to his risk and treatment. The General Manager assured me that he has already requested an urgent review of the system, but he was unable to provide any further information upon conclusion of the inquest as to what further action, if any, is proposed. 3. Inadequate skills/knowledge/training on how to encourage patients to engage I am concerned that clinical, nursing and/or support staff may not currently have sufficient skills or knowledge in dealing with patients who appear unable or unwilling to engage with staff and/or treatment. A psychiatrist not involved in Dan's care gave evidence about the advice he would have given to colleagues on how to seek to assist a patient who, like Dan, was unwilling or unable to engage with staff: first, identify the likely reasons for the patient's lack of engagement; second, having regard to those reasons, develop plans and strategies to address the specific barriers identified. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 I heard little evidence that either of these steps was followed by any of the staff involved in Dan's care. One barrier was identified (his previous negative experiences on the ward and wish to be transferred to another ward or hospital) but seemingly forgotten after an initial transfer request to the Bed Management team, which was not then followed up. Even with the benefit of hindsight, the doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants involved in Dan's care seemed unable to offer any insight into the reasons for his difficulties engaging beyond his diagnosis of EUPD or articulate any strategies or techniques that might have helped him overcome them. The following matters of concern are addressed to Secretary of State for Health and Social Care & NHS England 1. I am concerned that confirmed ingestion of during a 999 call does not trigger a category 1 response from the Ambulance Service / Dan ingested at around 20:30 on 22 April 2022. His friend informed the 999 call handler that he had done so during a first 999 call at 20:39. That call was correctly graded as requiring a category 2 response, as Dan was both conscious and awake. 14 minutes later, at 20:53, Dan collapsed. His friend's second 999 call was correctly graded as requiring a category 1 response, as Dan had become unconscious, his breathing agonal. The first ambulance crew arrived at 21:04. Dan went into cardiac arrest at approximately 21:24. Consideration was given by the ambulance crew to scoop and run ' ' to arrange a rendezvous to administer the necessary “drugs to counter ”, but this was no considered longer feasible once Dan had gone into cardiac arrest. evidence expressed deep concern at its easy availability and growing popularity for vulnerable people seeking to end their own lives. The expert toxicological evidence indicated that its acute toxic effects can be rapid (as short as 20 minutes after ingestion, depending on dose) and can quickly become irreversible. The inquest heard evidence from a consultant toxicologist that even in very small quantities (or ) is lethal; it is a potent poison. I understand it is also, tragically, an increasingly common means of suicide. Mental health professionals who gave This suggests that almost any case involving the ingestion of or is likely to be a time critical life-threatening event. Yet it is does not currently fall within that category for the purposes of grading 999 calls, unless the patient is unconscious or not breathing. While there was no evidence that a category 1 response would have prevented Dan's death, I believe there is a risk that other deaths will occur if ingestion of continues to require a category 2 response. The following matters of concern are addressed to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Chief Executive of OFCOM 1. Continuing accessibility of Dan was using an online suicide forum, Through that forum he was able to engage in discussions with other members and obtain information Notwithstanding the provisions of the Online Safety Act 2023, and apparent attempts to block access to the website, I heard evidence that it remains easily accessible to vulnerable people in the UK. I am concerned that further deaths will occur while this remains the case. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 January 2024. The Conclusion of the Inquest was that the Deceased died as result of Suicide .,"The Deceased suffered with physical disabilities, mental health issues, and alcoholism. Her husband of 39 years was her main carer. At around 19.15 hours on 3 January 2023, the Deceased reported to Police that her husband was being violent towards her. On attending, the Police could see no visible marks or cuts but arrested her husband; the Deceased made it clear that she did not support any criminal action against him. On 4 January 2023, her husband was bailed until 28 February 2023 with conditions that he was not to return to the marital home. Police also made a Safeguarding Referral to Social Services who organised an urgent welfare visit to the Deceased that same evening. The Deceased refused all care services offered during the visit and stated that she would kill herself if her husband did not return home (but not that evening). The Deceased continued to refuse care when contacted by Social Services the following morning but was provided with the telephone number for the Safeguarding Team. Sometime between 14.45 and 15.45 on 6 January 2023 and, in a distressed state, Sylvia left a message on the Safeguarding Team's phone requesting help. At 15.06 hours, she also sent a text to her Victim Engagement Officer stating that she could not cope on her own and requesting a call. Although a member of the Safeguarding Team spoke briefly to her on the phone at 16.30 hours, they requested Police to make an urgent welfare visit; a 'prompt response' was organised by Police Control Room at 16.56 hours but, owing to service demand, they arrived at 19.24 hours and found the Deceased unresponsive on the living room floor. Despite all resuscitation efforts, paramedics confirmed her death at 20.25 hours. [REDACTED] and notes to her husband and to Police were found at the scene. The notes confirmed an intention to end her life and the note to Police indicated that she felt that they had not listened to her.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Although the Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) carried out in this case has already recommended a number of issues for agencies to consider, additional matters have been observed by the Court in relation to Police action: (i) Whilst some officers carried out their tasks effectively and appropriately, overall important steps in the Deceased's husband's arrest and subsequent conditional pre-charge bail did not appear to have been followed. (ii) In particular, S47ZZA PACE 1984 requires the investigating officer to seek the views of the alleged victim on whether relevant conditions should be imposed on the person's bail and then to inform the custody officer of these views but this was not done in this case: the first time that the Deceased was made aware of the nature of her husband's bail conditions was when the Police brought him home after his release on bail to collect his belongings. (iii) An earlier discussion between Police and the Deceased might have highlighted the Deceased's deep emotional and physical dependence on her husband and the need to consider alternative options to criminal investigation with potentially more supportive care attached to them, such as the use of a DVPN/DVPO as highlighted by the DHR. 6"

Deborah was aged 61 at the time of her death. I have commenced as of today's date a Coronial Investigation into Deborah's death and will shortly be opening an Inquest into her death once the postmortem examination has taken place, and I am in a position to release her body back to the family.","From information provided by the police I have reason to suspect that her death is unnatural and given the cherry red complexion noted in relation to photographs that I have seen of Deborah's body and the presence of apparatus, some of which was purchased on line from Amazon, it appears that she has put together an apparatus [REDACTED] died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Notes were left at the scene as regards her intention to end her life. As part of the police report I received photographs taken from her computer of a publication [REDACTED]. My investigation will establish how she acquired that digital copy. The book essentially contains instructions on how to make a piece of apparatus [REDACTED] The book also covers other methods again with the aim of end an individual's life. I then Googled the said publication in order to see if the publication could be purchased here in the UK, which then led me to the Amazon UK site where I found that copies of this publication were freely available and supplied direct by Amazon UK. [REDACTED]there was also a similar publication [REDACTED] “was also marketed in both electronic and paperback formats. This second publication seems to also suggest that it may contain instructions as to how one goes about ending one's life.","The law states that a Coroner has a duty to make a Report, such as this report, with a view to the prevention of future deaths whereas part of an investigation evidence raises such a concern. That duty in my view has arisen in this case when I discovered that books giving clear instructions as to how an individual might want to end his or her life was freely available on the open market on the Amazon.co.uk website. I am concerned that the marketing and supply of such a book giving such clear instructions and advice as regards different methods for an individual to end his or her life at their own hands is of the utmost concern as is the regulation as regards the supply of such publications whose sole purpose is to provide information to those contemplating on ending their lives. I have identified 2 publication that give such advice and there may be more currently being marketed on the Amazon.co.uk website. I have raised the concern and ask that both Amazon.co.uk and His Majesty's Government consider how best to address the concern raised in this letter.

The Rt Hon Alex Chalk KC MP, Minister of Justice. 1","On 30th June 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Gregory Price. An inquest was concluded on 30 January 2024. The conclusion of the Inquest was that Mr Price died of multiple injuries, with a short-form conclusion of suicide being recorded.","Matthew Gregory Price was aged 48. He was convicted of a s.18 assault by wounding in 2010 when he was aged 35 and has been subject to an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection ('IPP'). He served a term of imprisonment before being released back into the community. Whilst IPP sentences were abolished in 2012, Mr Price remained subject to his sentence which was imposed in 2010. At the time of his death, Mr Price had engaged legal support in order to make an application for review of his sentence which was at an early stage. Since 2022, a review is initiated at the ten-year mark and yearly thereafter, if appropriate. Mr Price's first ten- year review was due to take place in November 2023. At the conclusion of the inquest, I recorded the following facts. 'On the evening of 16 June 2023 Matthew Gregory Price was struck by a train travelling from Leeds to Manchester at Cottingley Railway Station, Cottingley Drive, Cottingley [REDACTED]. He suffered multiple injuries and his death was confirmed by paramedics at 2149 hours. Matthew's mental well-being had been adversely affected over a significant period of time by the continuing impact of serving an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection (IPP). He was especially anxious that seeking help in respect of his mental health could impact negatively when making an application to discharge the sentence further to its imposition in 2010. It is apparent from a text message sent just prior to his death that Matthew intended to take his own life'","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. It was apparent from the evidence that I heard and read at the inquest that there are serious concerns about the welfare of individuals who remain subject to IPP sentences. For example, the Independent Monitoring Boards ('IMB') completed a report with key findings entitled 'The impact of IPP sentences on prisoners' wellbeing' in May 2023. This report was written following the rejection by the government of the recent Justice Select 2 Committee's recommendation for a re-sentencing exercise to take place for anyone serving an IPP sentence. Whilst the key findings of the IMB report are focused upon the impact upon serving prisoners and the prevention of recall, I was deeply concerned about the evidence I heard in relation to the clear impact that the on-going IPP sentence had had on Mr Price. He had served a three year tariff and at the time of his death he had been released back into the community for nearly ten years Mr Price was anxious about the ever-present potential for recall to prison. Furthermore, he had conveyed in communications to others that he felt that seeking help with his mental health by way of support and medication might count against him when seeking to be successful in discharging the IPP. Whilst Mr Price was engaged with legal support in navigating the review process, the on-going impact of uncertainty of being on an IPP sentence was clearly apparent. As a consequence of undertaking Mr Price's inquest, the on-going wellbeing of those serving IPP sentences, be that in prison estate or in the community, is a matter of concern to me as a Coroner. The Ministry of Justice is fully apprised of the IPP context and whilst matters have been raised by the IMB I am concerned that specific focus upon the welfare of individuals living in the community should be appraised by those who may be able to take appropriate steps to further support an evidently vulnerable section of society, 6"

On 12 March 2021 Mia was found deceased at home aged 14 years old. On the 18 March 2021 an investigation was opened into her death and an inquest was opened on 31 March 2021. Following a lengthy police investigation a final inquest hearing concluded before me on 26 January 2024 as follows: “Mia Janin took her life while still a child and while still in the process of maturing into adulthood”.,"Mia was last seen alive around 10pm on 11 March 2021 when saying goodnight to her parents in their family home. Mia was found deceased at home by her parents around 6.50am on 12 March 2021 suspended from from a ligature. Two undated notes in Mia's handwriting were found on her bed on 12 March 2021 addressed to her family and friends, which explained that Mia had decided to end her life. Mia's death was entirely unexpected by her family, friends and teachers. She had felt low self-esteem at times but had not been diagnosed with any mental illness nor presented a risk of taking her own life. Mia had close friends including at her secondary school but she also experienced bullying behaviour from some male students. Neither Mia's family nor teachers was aware of that behaviour before her death. On 10 March 2021 Mia posted a video on social media asking two of these male students not to mock her and criticising their music and fashion. This video received a large number of hostile responses, which Mia found stressful. On the evening of 1 1 March 2021 Mia said to her parents that she had had a difficult week and asked to move to a different secondary school, which they agreed to explore. Toxicological examination confirmed the absence of any illicit substances in Mia's system. The post-mortem examination found marks of self-harm (recent and old) of which Mia's family was not aware. Mia is much missed by her loving family, friends and wider community who describe her as creative, kind, entrepreneurial and highly intelligent, amongst many other things. The current head teacher of Mia's secondary school – the Jewish Free School (JFS) – gave evidence at the final inquest hearing concerning systemic changes introduced at JFS following Mia's death. This included a complete overhaul of safeguarding practices, increased behaviour management, improved information, staff surveys and externally delivered sessions by charities including Norwood, Streetwise, Jewish Women's Aid and Keshet. Evidence provided by some JFS students after Mia's death to the police and Ofsted described regular incidents of gender based bullying by some male JFS students of some female JFS students. Some of those child witnesses had not experienced a change in culture at JFS since Mia's death and did not describe being consulted or surveyed about the changes introduced by JFS.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Any ongoing gender based bullying at JFS gives rise to a concern that circumstances creating a risk of other deaths will occur, or will continue to exist, in the future; and The initiatives introduced by JFS to address gender based bullying following Mia's death do not appear to have gained the confidence of some JFS female students, which gives rise to a concern that circumstances creating a risk of other deaths will occur, or will continue to exist, in the future."

The College of Policing 1,"On the 25th October 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Samuel Curless (Sam). Sam died on the 24th October 2022 at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. He was 29 years old. The investigation into his death concluded on the 2nd February 2024 when I completed the inquest into his death. The medical cause of death was found to be 1a) Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy caused by 1b) hanging. I recorded a conclusion of suicide.","Sam had a long history of anxiety and depression. He had reported feeling suicidal in the past. He was the sole carer for his young son and his son was a protective factor for him. On the 23rd September 2022, the deceased was arrested at home in relation to an allegation of a serious criminal offence. He was taken to the police station where he was interviewed under caution. He was released on bail the same day with conditions not to have any contact with anyone under the age of 18. On Friday 21st October, Sam was informed that all of his bail conditions were removed, but that he remained under investigation. He was provided with police documentation that confirmed this. Sam contacted the children's social worker and informed her of the change to his bail and asked if he could now see his son unsupervised. The social worker told him that she would need to verify the bail position with the police before their plan could change. Sam agreed to continue with the supervised contact on Monday, but he would have found it difficult to hear and understand. At 14:05 on Saturday 22nd October, Sam made a call to GMP 101 service from his mobile phone. This call was connected to a GMP Call Handler at 14:12 and a police log was commenced. From the audio recording of the call, Sam could be heard telling the Call Handler that he thought he had found a dead body. He gave the location [REDACTED]. He said it was the first plot near some stainless-steel containers near the car park. The conversation between the deceased and the call handler lasted approximately 40 seconds, after which Sam did not respond to further attempts at engagement. The call handler kept the line open for just over 5 minutes. As the deceased's call to GMP was a 101 call (and not a 999 call), the Call Handler was not able to obtain the precise location using his mobile phone and data services. She obtained a street name to add to the location after talking to her supervisor. The Call Handler did not know that the deceased had any intent to take his own life, but she did conclude that there was a risk that the dead body he was reporting might not be dead. At 14:29 she graded the THRIVE risk as High and Graded the GMP Response as 1. She coded the call as G15 which includes a concern for welfare or risk of suicide. Radio Operators dispatched GMP officers at 14:33. The Call Handler failed to call an ambulance at 14:29. It was a GMP minimum standard expectation that she should have done so at the point that she had a location to dispatch to and was part of her training in response to reports of a dead body. [REDACTED] gave evidence to the inquest that this was an admitted failing by GMP, but I found that it did not make any material contribution to the death. Two Officers attended [REDACTED] at 14:38 within the Grade 1 response time. They located the Sam in a shed [REDACTED] at 14:42. They found him suspended from a ligature [REDACTED]. The first officer on the scene assumed that she was looking at a dead body. She did not check for a pulse until around 14:46. A total of three officers were in attendance by this point. A further check at 14:48 revealed that he was still warm and only at that point was he cut down. After further checks for a pulse, CPR was commenced by the officers at 14:50. The three initial attending officers failed to administer any basic life support to Sam for approximately 8 minutes after discovering him suspended. The officers failed to perform any immediate initial checks of Sam's vital signs when they discovered him. The officers failed to remove the ligature and therefore an airway obstruction at the earliest opportunity. It was GMP and College of Policing Policy that officers attending a suspected sudden death should not assume death, should make preservation of life their priority and not delay in administering basic life support until an ambulance arrives. In their evidence to the inquest, these failings were admitted by the officers but I found that did not make any material contribution to the death. The attending officers all assumed that an ambulance had been called by GMP comms. In fact, one was only contacted at 14:48. NWAS went mobile at 14:57 and attended the scene at 15:01 and commenced advanced life support. Following paramedic intervention, spontaneous circulation returned at 15:24. Sam was then taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary, where despite appropriate resuscitation and life preserving treatments he died on the 24th October 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. That in respect of GMP Call Handler's being required to call an ambulance to attend the scene, even where it is reported that someone is “dead” there has been no institutional learning following this incident. I asked if there had been any learning, reflection or training since this incident. He said that there hadn't on this issue. 2. That the training delivered to the first two attending officers did not adequately prepare them for responding to a scene where someone is found hanging in a way which is consistent with their priority to preserve life of a hanging casualty. 3. I heard evidence from Detective Superintendent that both attending officers were part of a cohort of at least 650 officers within GMP (and a larger cohort nationally) who received their 3 initial police training entirely online. I am concerned that both officers' training on Sudden Death (and the training of others) was delivered as one of over 15 online modules on a given day and that at the time of the inquest, they had not received any classroom based or on the job training. I am concerned that they are not the only officers within GMP who have received this level/method of training input and therefore there is a risk that other officers on duty have inadequate training on this issue. 4. There was evidence given to me by Detective Superintendent that there is an unknown number of GMP officers who are not meeting the expectation of receiving First Aid refresher training within 12 months, which since May 2022 has included training on how to resuscitate a hanging casualty. I am therefore concerned that there remains a cohort of officers who have not had the post May 2022 training that includes how to provide Basic Life Support to this kind of casualty until the arrival of an ambulance. 6"

Post-mortem examination confirmed that death was due to an overdose of multiple prescription medications. Thomas had a long history of mental health illness and was under the care of two separate secondary mental health service providers at the time of his death.

Dudley Integrated Health and Care NHS Trust 1. In the inquest, there was evidence that Thomas' family received letters from clinicians from Dudley Integrated Health and Care NHS Trust (DIH) requesting that Thomas made contact with them, which were sent after his death, causing obvious distress to his family. It is not difficult to see that this type of administrative error could lead to significant distress to families who are already vulnerable by virtue of their bereavement, and which could give rise to a risk of death. An RCA carried out by DIH identified that action was to be taken - namely that DIH should work with colleagues at Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (BCH) to establish and embed the process for notifying of patient deaths. However, this does not appear to be an action that has been identified in BCH's RCA report, and I am concerned by the apparent lack of collaborative working to ensure this process is carried out. 2. Secondly, the evidence on behalf of DIH was that the above action to be taken remains outstanding and has a target completion date that arises after the conclusion of this inquest. I am concerned that if this target is pushed back and/or is not not met, for whatever reason, there is a risk that future deaths will occur. Upon conclusion of the inquest, I am Functus Officio, with no power to request updates from the Trust to check and ensure that the targets have been met and changes have been made.

A Mental Health Act assessment carried out at the Magistrates Court on 24 September 2019 decided that he should be detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. However, as there were no hospital beds available at the time that Mr Popalzai's case was heard, he was remanded in custody to HMP Pentonville. Mr Popalzai was transferred to the inpatient wing at HMP Pentonville on 29 September 2019. There were significant barriers to communicating with Mr Popalzai as he spoke predominantly in Pashto. Throughout his time in the inpatient unit, Mr Popalzai was acutely psychotic. He was aggressive and most interactions with psychiatrists, healthcare staff and prison officers took place through the cell door. Mr Popalzai consistently refused to take any medication as he did not accept that he was mentally ill. Mr Popalzai stated on several occasions that he would hang himself if transferred to a psychiatric hospital. On 9 October 2019, Mr Popalzai was assessed by a psychiatrist who found that he was psychotic and needed to be transferred to hospital for treatment under section 48 Mental Health Act 1983. The Crystal Ward, which is the psychiatric intensive care unit at the Newham Centre for Mental Health, was identified as the appropriate unit. A second assessment was carried out by a psychiatrist from the Crystal Ward on 18 October. The 2nd psychiatrist agreed that Mr Popalzai should be detained on the Crystal Ward for assessment and treatment under section 48 Mental Health Act on 24 October 2019. However, there were no beds available on Crystal Ward at that time. On 21 November 2019, the Crystal Ward advised that a bed issued by the Ministry of Justice and arrangements were made for Mr Popalzai to be transferred to the Crystal Ward on the afternoon of 29 November 2019. At around 12.30 pm on 29 November 2019, Mr Popalzai was found hanging in his cell. Attempts were made to resuscitate Mr Popalzai but his death was confirmed by paramedics at the scene. The psychiatric evidence was consistent that: 1) the only effective treatment for Mr Popalzai's psychosis was anti- psychotic medication; 2) anti-psychotic medication could not be given to him against his wishes in a prison setting. As a result, he needed to be transferred to an appropriate psychiatric unit. 3) Mr Popalzai's mental health deteriorated in the time that he was waiting for a psychiatric bed to become available. I also heard evidence that a significant number of prisoners from HMP Pentonville were transferred to psychiatric units under the Mental Health Act each year. I was told that the experience of psychiatrists at the prison was that the target time of 14 days from 1st assessment to transfer set out in the statutory guidance was seldom met. I was also told that significant delays in beds becoming available were extremely common and delays of up to 6 months were not unheard of.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. – 1) Prisoners who are acutely psychotic and refusing treatment that requires transfer to hospital under the Mental Health Act are being left untreated and at risk of further deterioration due to a shortage of suitable psychiatric hospital bed spaces becoming available in a timely way. 6

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 January 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,"The circumstances of the death are as follows Philip David Taylor had a short history of mental health difficulties from April 2023 for which he was receiving support from the Community Mental Health Team and Home Treatment Team, part of the Betsi Cadwaladr University Local Health Board. On 28 July 2023 he was admitted as an informal patient to a private psychiatric unit at Elysium Ty Grosvenor Hospital, Wrexham. He was admitted to there as there were no beds available within the NHS North Wales area. He was discharged on 15 August 2023 to the care of the Home Treatment Team.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Coroner's Office, County Hall, Wynnstay Road, Ruthin, LL15 1YN | The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows – a. The Health Board utilises facilities out of area for acute psychiatric care when there are no available beds in the NHS in North Wales. I was informed that the patients, however, remain the responsibility of the Health Board. During the deceased's time at Ty Grosvenor it does not appear that any/all relevant information was shared between the two organisations e.g. deceased's progress, medication, treatment etc, except for few telephone conversations. b. There was no joined up planning or joint meeting between the Health Board and Ty Grosvenor prior to the deceased's discharge. c. The prescription and administration record together with a copy of the pre- admission paperwork were only sent to the Health Board two days after the deceased was discharged. d. The discharge summary was emailed to the Health Board three days after discharge, but this was either not received by the Health Board or received and not acted upon. In fact, it is the deceased's wife who had informed the Home Treatment Team that the deceased had been discharged. On knowing this, no one sought to request the discharge summary from Ty Grosvenor, even where there was a change in medication dosage. e. There was no evidence at Inquest of any written agreement or standard operating procedure or similar between the Health Board and private facility as to minimum standard requirements or expectations between both organisations e.g. what documentation should be shared, how it is to be shared, when documentation should be shared, the timeliness of sharing documentation etc. f. It is concerning that such minimum standards are not set out and agreed between the Health Board and this private psychiatric unit in a situation where many patients are likely to be treated there. It is not known whether or not such minimum standards or Agreement exists with other out of area private units. g. In the event that patients are to be treated in private units out of the area then there will be a risk of future deaths if such minimum standards regarding sharing of information and communication are not set and agreed between the Health Board and private facility. There had been no consideration of this as part of the actions arising from the Health Board's own investigation. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30th January 2024. The conclusion of the inquest jury was that Samuel Thomas Jordan died as a result of suspension by a ligature, his death being by suicide whilst suffering from mental illness.",Samuel Thomas Jordan was sentenced to 8 weeks' imprisonment at HMP Exeter. This was his first time in prison. He suffered from mental illness which whilst in prison manifested itself in bizarre behaviour and an act of self-harm. Following fights with a cell mate on 26th March 2020 he was placed in a single occupancy cell where he was found hanging about 4 ½ hours later,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – During the four months before his imprisonment, Samuel Jordan had been receiving treatment for severe anxiety while registered as a temporary patient with a medical practice in Launceston, Cornwall. Samuel had come to Cornwall from his home in Whitchurch, Hampshire where he was registered with another GP practice. On entering HMP Exeter, the prison Healthcare obtained a summary of Samuel's GP records from Hampshire via the NHS spine. The records from the Launceston practice were not sent to the prison since the NHS spine only operates to transmit records from the permanent GP practice and not a practice consulted on a temporary basis. As a result, Exeter Prison Healthcare was unaware of Samuel's mental health issues immediately before coming to Prison and was unaware of a current medication prescription lack of which the jury found contributed to Samuel's death. The inquest heard that prisoners coming to prison frequently were nomadic and frequently had registered with GP practices on a temporary basis with the records from such practices not coming to the notice of prison healthcare as such records are not 2 accessible through the NHS spine. Lack of access through the NHS Spine to the records of the practice where Samuel was registered as a temporary patient was, the jury found, a contributory factor in Samuel's death. 6"

This impacted on his day-to-day health and well being. He had a complex past medical history to include depression, [REDACTED] addiction and chronic multi system, medically unexplained symptoms of unclear cause. There had not been a formal diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome as there was minimal evidence to reach this but he was under specialist care provided by the Clinical Immunology Department at Derriford Hospital who were providing valuable advice and guidance to manage his symptoms. Guy had previously disclosed to his sister, GP and Mental Health Services that he had researched ways to end his life and at one stage stated he had a plan in place but that he did not intend to act on those plans. He had some contact with mental health services and engaged in 3 intervention sessions with Wellbeing Coaches in October 2022 following which he reported feeling better. His final contact with the Mental Health Connect team was on 15th May 2023 when he reported ongoing chronic suicidal ideation. He agreed to contact with his GP and a safety plan was discussed. A review was held with his GP on 31st May 2023 at which time his physical and mental health was discussed at length. There was no change in his chronic suicidal thoughts, and he was keen to explore treatment and support for his condition. He declined any referral for further mental health or psychology services at that time. Guy contacted his sister on the telephone in the early hours of 1st July 2023 and his opening comment was that he loved her. She stated that she would call him later. On attempting to contact him later that morning she was unable to get a response and raised a concern for welfare. Police officers attended his home address and he was found deceased in the bath. His death was confirmed at 15:24 on 1 July 2023. His death was due to Asphyxiation. Police Officers at the scene located a printed 60-page document at his home address titled “[REDACTED]” which had been printed from a website [REDACTED].

South West Yorkshire Partnership Trust 1,On 10 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rachel Louise MORTIMER. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 January 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging in the context of cocaine and alcohol usage 1b 1c II,"On 25 June 2023 Rachel Mortimer took her own life . She was found by her son in her garden hanging [REDACTED]. In December 2022 Rachel Mortimer took an overdose of [REDACTED]. A Mental health act assessment was undertaken but she was not deemed to require sectioning at this time. On 18 June 2023 Rachel was seen by the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) at Barnsley Hospital after taking an overdose of prescribed [REDACTED] and trying to hang herself. She said she had been having suicidal thoughts for a long time, she did not regret her actions and that thoughts of her family did not stop her. She was assessed by the MHLT as having risk of future impulsive self harm and suicide when using alcohol and risk of further deterioration of her mental state without timely appropriate mental health support to develop coping skills. She was referred to IHBTT and was discharged from hospital. No MHA assessment was undertaken. She was seen by IHBTT and her risks of emotional dysregulation without engaging in therapy and risk of harmful alcohol use were identified. She was to be referred to BSARCS and told to refer herself to recovery services as mitigation. She was assessed as low risk of suicide even though she had initially stated she was not regretful of what done and disappointed that she had not died, she was assessed as not having current suicidal thoughts or intentions of suicide and wanted to engage in therapy. She was provided with contact numbers to call if she wanted to discuss her mental health at any time. Unfortunately, whilst she was referred to BSARCS she was not accepted. Despite this being a risk factor no other mitigation was offered at this time and therefore the risk was not mitigated. On 21 June at 4pm IBHTT Rachel's mother contacted IHBTT with concerns, she was told that Rachel should contact the GP for access to services and that they could not provide any information due to data protection. At no point was Mrs Mortimer provided any information on what to do if she was concerned for Rachels safety such as taking her to ED or that Rachel could contact certain mental health services to discuss her feelings in a crisis. A further call was made at 5.30pm, an hour and a half later, by Rachel's son, who expressed concerns that she was expressing suicidal ideas, again no signposting was given. A further call was made on the same day by paramedics with concerns and again they were told that she had been advised to contact her GP. No signposting was provided or consideration given to the fact previously identified risks which had not been mitigated and she was drinking which had been identified as having a risk of future impulsive self harm and suicide. Despite these 3 contacts by family and paramedics, at no point was any safety netting in terms of the options available if they were concerned provided, such as to take her to ED or for her to call any mental health services given. A phone call was made that evening to Rachel but as Police were with her she was unable to discuss and asked for a call back later which was not answered. IHBTT discussed Rachel on 22 June 2023 and decided she should be called for a review of her mental state and risks and to offer secondary mental health follow up. 7 telephone calls were made between 22 and 26 June with no success. IHBTT knowing that she had had 2 previous suicide attempts, had risk factors that had not been mitigated and had recently been contacted on by family with significant concerns that she was suicidal the IHBTT treatment team took no further action and on 26 June, with no contact, assessed her as low risk due to lack of contact.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. Following concerned calls by family no advice was provided on what options were available to them if they were concerned for their family members safety and no provision of services that could be called to discuss her mental state. 2.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 August 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that the Deceased impulsively took his own life (by jumping from a bridge) whilst suffering an acute anxiety crisis.,"The Deceased died in hospital care at 06.35 on the morning of 30 June 2022 after falling from a road bridge across Thomas Lewis Way in Southampton at approximately 05.30 that morning. Despite emergency medical attention he was unable to be resuscitated and died as a result of his injuries. No drugs or alcohol were involved in the death. The Deceased was a third-year student at university and was neurodiverse. He had been struggling with the pressures of his third year of study, following irregularities created and imposed on his otherwise established study routine and rhythm of daily living as a result of successive lockdowns. He had also fallen ill with Covid-19 in March 2022 and was believed to have been suffering long covid symptoms in the subsequent months. His illness had impacted on his concentration and his ability to perform, as well as causing chronic fatigue and insomnia. As a result, he had fallen behind in his third-year project and, it is believed, had determined that he was going to be unable to successfully pass his year of study, thereby preventing his ability to proceed at university and halting his ambition to pursue his academic career. It is believed that these factors had had an overwhelming effect on him, leading, on 30 June 2022 – the day of the publication of his exam results – to an acute anxiety crisis out of which he was unable to see a path. Although he had left no clear explanation of his feelings or reason for his actions, the evidence established that it was more likely than not that he had jumped from the bridge in a moment of acute distress in the early hours of the morning. There was no evidence to suggest that he had accidentally fallen to his death and no evidence of any third-party involvement. It was found that his actions were impulsive yet deliberate in their intent to take his own life, whilst suffering an acute anxiety crisis.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Matthew was neurodiverse. It was accepted that this condition was not known by the university at the relevant time, as he was diagnosed after his commencement on his course and did not disclose his condition to the university. In the circumstances, appropriate actions and case specific assistance which might otherwise have been availble to and assisted Matthew were neither implemented in response nor accessed by him. Notwithstanding Matthew's neurodiverity – which of itself was a barrier to him being able to reach out or to seek help - I am concerned about the level of awareness, understanding and curiosity of accademic staff around the mental health of students, particularly in the post-pandemic climate, where interruptions to their study and dysregulated student life have had a significant impact on their mental health. Whilst it was explained to me that all staff are offered training on mental health management and are provided with guidance on how to support students, I am concerned that aspects of this are not made compulsory for accademic staff. Where a myriad of training options are made availble to staff and often required of them, with very little practical time availble in which to do it, there is a risk that modules and aids with regard to mental health will not be prioritised, followed through or addressed. There is as I understand it no evident monitoring in respect of which staff have viewed or undertaken what training or indeed in respect of who has completed the modules on offer. It remains unclear as to who or how many staff have actually viewed or undertaken the online training around student mental health. Although the process of 'raising a concern' by accademic staff is a means by which such matters can be considered and is a process set up and encouraged through the student hubs, I am concerned that in not ensuring that accademic staff are at least armed with the ability to spot or to know when to make initial enquiries of students or are clearly guided on how best to do so (particularly with regard to an understanding of the needs and skills required to liaise with students with neurodiversity), there is a risk that an over-focus on accademic policies and procedures will endure and that those students who are struggling to adhere to them will be missed or overlooked. 2. It was evident to the Court that very positive steps have already been undertaken in planning towards an 'early warning system' for students in the accademic year 2023/24. This will allow triggers to be identified and set for accademic absence and changes in study or support behaviours (as is to be trialled in 2023/24). Such steps are to be commended and I hope will proceed at pace. However, I do have concerns that there is and remains an evident gap between the accademic assessment of students and the pastoral support that they receive. I hope this will be addressed and filled – in part in the development of staff training and understanding around mental health and in what circumstances concerns should be raised (as above). Where accademic absence or performance issues are identified, I am not convinced, on the evidence heard at this inquest, that enough has yet been done to also consider how 'reaching out' to such students can be most effectively achieved. It was evident that much of the group-focused approaches offered by the universtity or the initaitves where the onus is placed on the student to come forward, may not work. Practically, how best can students – especially those with neurodiverse needs – be compassionately and empathetically approached and engaged with to ensure they receive the help and validation that they probably desperately require? Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 3. The evidence at this inquest raised concerns over the existance, frequency and accuracy of the recording and minueting of accademic meetings with students, especially those between the student and Personal Accademic Tutor and the Project Supervisor in the third year of study. It was of concern to me that the University was unable to locate or provide clear minutes of supervisory catch ups, progress checks or agreed guidance or actions for Matthew. It was of further concern that the accademic staff supporting and mentoring him in his third year had not provided written evidence of his progress or agreed minutes of actions etc to him. Whilst it is recognised, particularly in a third year of study, that there must be a balance between independence and appropriate support, it would in my view be important for any student and university accadenic team to have a clear record of achievement or progress. This must be able to be reflected back to the student and recorded in such a way as to ensure that both student and tutor are clear and agreed as to progress that has been achieved and as to what needs to be done to move forward. The absence of such information and appropriate support, which can lead to feelings of isolation and desperation, must be avoided at all costs. 6"

However, they reported to me at inquest that there was some delay in the attendance of LFB. 2. Upon attendance, firefighters recognised that their ladders would not reach the roof of the flats and so called for an extended height ladder appliance. This had to travel from further afield and became more agitated during the wait. It had not arrived at 5.33pm when he jumped. The police were especially concerned that the extended height ladder appliance had not been requested from the outset, given that the call was in respect of a person on the roof of a block of flats.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 December 2023. Medical cause of death 1a Cerebral hypoxia 1b Hanging The Conclusion was as follows: suicide","Tom suffered a sudden acute deterioration in his mental health, exhibiting signs of a depressive disorder in August 2021. He sought medical assistance and was assessed by the Hounslow liaison psychiatry service on 18th August. At that time he did not disclose any plans to take his own life, but did confirm he was having suicidal thoughts and thoughts that he could not continue living. Due to poor communication from the hospital to the General Practise, the intended prescription for antidepressant medication was not provided. On 20th August 2021 Tom locked himself in the garage at home, [REDACTED] and was found later that morning suspended by ligature. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. Tom was assessed in relation to his mental ill health presentation by the Consultant liaison psychiatrist, but the Trust template was not completed, which was not in compliance with the Trust policy and criticised in the Trust serious incident report. There is a concerning mismatch of what more junior colleagues are expected to do and be trained in, compared with Senior practitioners demonstrated work practises. 2. No letter of discharge was sent at the time Tom was seen by the liaison psychiatry team, and a letter was only generated in response to investigations taking place after the death. The team acknowledged that there were “problems” with sending out letters at the time, and no evidence was brought before the court that this issue has now been resolved. Letters should be dispatched within 24 hours of attendance. Communication between the various community teams and setting out the treatment plan to the patient are important factors that were not effective during Tom's care and remain a concerning omission where there may be a simple and effective remedy. 3. It was acknowledged that obtaining collateral information from the family is vital, but in this case was delegated to a very Junior member of the team who was in the early stages of her training. It should be considered if this task is appropriate to delegate, and if so what information should be sought from families/carers and how that should be effectively used to support patient care. 4. The Trust showed good intentions of reviewing the training programme, but were unable to evidence that planned 6 monthly audits had actually taken place, and so there was no evidence before the court that the new training that had arisen from the serious incident findings was effective. Introducing new training, templates and supervision performance appraisals all seem to be positive interventions, but in the absence of any process to audit their effectiveness, it is concerning that the Trust have no way in which to judge their impact. 6"

Chief Constable Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary 1","On 26th October 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Meghan Irene CHRISMAS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24th April 2023. The inquest was heard with a Jury. Mrs. CHRISMAS died of: 1a: Hypoxic Brain Injury 1b: Cardiac Arrest (Resuscitated) 1c: Hanging The jury returned the following narrative conclusion: Narrative conclusion On 18th February 2021, Mrs. CHRISMAS had a face-to-face appointment with her GP, after which 50mg of the anti-depressant Sertraline was prescribed. Mrs. CHRISMAS suffered a panic attack on 4th July 2021 whilst out with friends for which an ambulance was called. On 7th July 2021, Mrs. CHRISMAS was referred to a private psychiatrist who admitted her voluntarily to the Priory, Roehampton after a new patient assessment. Mrs. CHRISMAS had two consultations with the private psychiatrist before electing to discharge herself from the Priory on 16th July 2021. Following this discharge, Mrs. CHRISMAS continued to meet with the private psychiatrist and received prescriptions from both the private psychiatrist and her GP, meaning that Mrs. CHRISMAS had access to double prescriptions. Mrs. CHRISMAS also commenced Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy on 9th August 2021 with a separate private mental health practitioner. On 1st October 2021, Mrs. CHRISMAS impulsively attempted suicide by overdose and was admitted to Royal Surrey Hospital on the following day. Mrs. CHRISMAS was offered further psychiatric treatment through the NHS at this time, which she declined in favour of continuing with her private treatments. On 4th October 2021, Mrs. CHRISMAS's GP received a letter from Surrey and Borders Partnership's psychiatric liaison service concerning her attendance the previous day. This letter was passed on to neither the private psychiatrist nor the EMDR therapist who were treating Mrs. CHRISMAS. Healthcare professionals treating Mrs. CHRISMAS placed significant reliance on the perception that she would be open and honest in her communication with them. Following concerns expressed to Mrs. CHRISMAS's GP by her husband, on 12th October 2021, the GP made an urgent referral to NHS Mental Health Services, which was ultimately rejected on the basis that Mrs. CHRISMAS had capacity and had not provided consent to be referred. On 18th October 2021, Mrs. CHRISMAS had an outpatient appointment with her private psychiatrist who reported that Mrs. CHRISMAS was progressing well. After checking into the Premier Inn, Guildford, Mrs. CHRISMAS expressed in a WhatsApp message to her husband that she planned to hang herself. Shortly thereafter, her husband called 999 to report his concerns. At 16:54, Mrs. CHRISMAS contacted Surrey Police to explain that she was fine and in Guildford, although she gave no further details with respect to her location. The incident regarding Mrs. CHRISMAS was initially logged as a Grade 1 Missing Person; however, according to the Hampshire Police control room logs there appears to have been some confusion with respect to risk status. Police officers acted under the impression that the incident was indeed high-risk, but the log describes the risk status as low. On the basis of this information, the handler in the control room decided to communicate with Surrey Police via email rather than by telephone at 17:18, which was inappropriate in light of the reality of the incident. It could not be concluded that this shortcoming significantly shortened the life of Mrs. CHRISMAS. By 18:15, there had been no response from Surrey Police, at which point the handler communicated via telephone. Police officers arrived at [REDACTED], Guildford at 18:37 and sought access to the room in which Mrs. CHRISMAS was staying; however they found the room to be barricaded. Upon gaining access to the room, officers found Mrs. CHRISMAS suspended [REDACTED]. Attempts were made to resuscitate Mrs. CHRISMAS, resulting in the restarting of her heartbeat. After resuscitation, Mrs. CHRISMAS was transported to Royal Surrey County Hospital where she died two days later on 20th October 2021 from a Hypoxic Brain Injury. Meghan Irene CHRISMAS took her own life whilst suffering from the diagnosed illnesses of Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.","The circumstances of the death are recorded in the Jury's Narrative Conclusion. CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. The concerns raised were as follows: a. Passage of information between NHS and private healthcare providers. At a time where pressures on the NHS exist, particularly for mental health services, it is of concern that measures which could alleviate this pressure (where someone sources private care) do not exist. There is little or no policy, guidance or other effective arrangements to share important clinical information about patients between private and public healthcare sectors. b. The handling of the incident involving Mrs. CHRISMAS in Hampshire Constabulary's Force Control Room which resulted in a hour delay in determining that an important communication (being a request for assistance) had not been received by a neighbouring force. This raises concerns as to the effectiveness in the supervision of operators handling the calls and the presence of redundancies or safeguards to detect such circumstances sooner to avoid repetition. I received further evidence orally and in writing from the Interested Persons' subsequent to the completion of the Inquest in relation to these concerns. This evidence included responses from Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SABP), The Priory Hospital, [REDACTED] concerning the measures which have been put in place to address the concerns identified during the course of the Inquest with respect to sub-paragraph a. (above). I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of those Interested Persons. In addition, I received evidence from Hampshire Constabulary concerning the measures which have been put in place to address the concerns identified during the course of the Inquest as outlined at sub-paragraph b. (above). These measures included: a. Revision of training provided and the introduction of additional training for supervisors and control room staff. b. Implementation of National Policy concerning Missing Persons, including documentation to assist in control room responses to similar circumstances. c. Revision of the recording of risk assessment measurements on the computer aided dispatch record (CAD) system. It was further explained to the court that the measures should be seen in the context of wider cultural change management in the supervision and leadership being undertaken by Hampshire Constabulary in the operation of the Control Room. I have taken account of the measures, many of which are of a policy nature, as outlined by Hampshire Constabulary. However, I remain concerned in relation to the matters identified at sub-paragraph b. (above). In addition, I am concerned that, although welcoming the local changes implemented by the Grayshott Surgery Practice, The Priory Roehampton and SABP, there is an absence of a wider national structure within the NHS that facilitates the effective passage of patient information between the private and public healthcare sectors. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. The effectiveness in the supervision of operators handling calls in the Hampshire Police Force Control Room to detect circumstances such as those which involved Mrs. CHRISMAS sooner and to avoid repetition. Evidence of the change required in this respect, was not provided to the court beyond limited training measures; either in the form of a plan to bring such change about, or evidence that such change has otherwise occurred. The passage of information between NHS and private healthcare providers is hindered due to the absence of an adequate structure to share important clinical information about patients in a timely and effective manner.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 December 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that: This was a death due to suicide.,"Adrian Gallagher had a history of mental health struggles dating back to 2013, with no definitive diagnosis. On 12 June 2017 he was admitted to Hollins Park Hospital as an informal patient, but was discharged at his request on 16 June 2017. The same day, he was taken to hospital having been found intoxicated at a bridge, with suicidal ideation. He was formally sectioned under the Mental Health Act the following day and re-admitted to Hollins Park. During the admission, Adrian's condition appeared to stabilise with changes to his medication, and he was allowed long periods of unescorted leave. By August 2017 he was awaiting a bed at Lea Court, a rehabilitation unit, and was spending the majority of the day away from the hospital. His presentation during this period did not give the hospital team or his parents cause for concern in relation to self harm/ suicidal ideation. On 9 November 2017 Adrian returned to hospital following a period of leave at his father's house. No concerns or changes to his presentation were noted. Sadly, he was found deceased in bed the following morning, with his death confirmed at 08.50 on 10 November 2017. His death was due to an intentional [REDACTED] overdose. Police interrogation of Adrian's phone after his death identified that on 12 September 2017 he made a purchase from [REDACTED]. It is not clear from the phone records what that purchase was, but it was the evidence at the inquest that the most likely purchase was the [REDACTED].[REDACTED]. It was the evidence of the attending police officer that, although not easy to do, you can also buy [REDACTED] through the site. [REDACTED].","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) is available to anyone to purchase online, directly from the company. The company appears to have some link to the UK as there is a UK helpline number. The appears to provide step by step instruction on how to end your life using certain methods, including how to make the death appear to be due to natural causes and therefore avoid referral to the coroner. Whilst the introduction suggests it is aimed at those who are elderly and long-term suffering, there is also reference to suicide for other reasons within the book and is likely to appear to vulnerable mental health patients. According to the evidence of the police officer, you can also buy drugs to end your life through this website. The only check on age and ID appears to be after a purchase, to allow you access to online forums where you can get further advice on best methods. The has been banned in Australia (and possibly other countries) as it is deemed to encourage/ assist in suicide.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide. The medical cause of death was: 1a Decapitation.,"On 19th February 2023, the deceased jumped on to the tracks of Platform 2 at Turnham Green Underground Station into the path of an oncoming train. She sustained multiple injuries incompatible with life. At the time she was under the care of Oxleas NHS Trust Adults' Community Mental Health Team. She believed she had early onset dementia which was being investigated. She had poor sleep and low mood in the months prior to her death but there was no formal diagnosis for her mental condition at the time of her death.","British Transport Police made a referral to the Older Adult Community Mental Health Team, Oxleas NHS Trust, on 25th January 2023, following an incident at Hither Green Station, when Mrs Porter had attempted to end her life by standing in front of an incoming train, which stopped. The 9 page referral included information that Mrs Porter: ""...made a deliberate act to jump onto the tracks in front of a train"" and ""Q: In your opinion, due to proximity of lethal means if it hadn't been for certain actions would death or serious harm have occurred? A:Yes"". The summary of the incident on page 4, was only partially complete, in that it did not include the information that the train had stopped. It stated she: ""decided to jump down on to the tracks to take her own life but then changed her mind and came back onto the platform"". The inquest heard the Trust did not interrogate the Safeguarding and Vulnerability Report, prepared by British Transport Police. The Trust Staff relied on the summary of the incident, both at the triage stage and subsequently during the psychiatric reviews. The Trust staff did not contact British Transport Police again to establish any information about the incident (for example the CCTV was not viewed nor a summary of the footage requested, nor were any meetings convened or discussions held between the Trust and British Transport Police). The Trust conducted a review of the care and treatment provided to Mrs Porter. Their Report stated: ""Had the referral from BTP to OACMHT included a full account of the circumstances of the incident on 25 January 2023, the OACMHT would have had a fuller understanding of the level of intent exhibited on that occasion, and subsequently risks would have been determined as high, and a more robust plan of care implemented to mitigate against these risks, that would have been immediately shared with her family"". It was established at Inquest that had the full details of the incident on 25th January 2023 been understood - ie that Denise intended to take her life and this was only prevented by the slowing and halting of the train - that the psychiatrist would have referred her either to the Intensive Home Treatment Team (with consent) or for a Mental Health Act assessment (if no consent had been forthcoming). The Trust's Report stated: ""There were no identified service delivery issues that impacted on the services' ability to offer care and treatment"". However, in oral evidence, the Trust's witness agreed this was inaccurate, following reflection upon the missed opportunities of investigating the events of 25th January 2023. The Trust was unable to provide the Inquest with information to satisfy my concern that the Trust has robust systems in place to avoid the risk that staff may rely upon short summaries from British Transport Police, rather than scrutinising all the information contained within a referral and making relevant inquiries if the reporting is ambiguous or incomplete. In this case, the Trust was clearly of the view that the detail was significant but was overly reliant upon partial information which resulted in missed opportunities for appropriate referral."

He was a serving prisoner. A coronial inquest into his death was opened on 29 November 2018. An inquest before a jury was resumed on 22 May 2022 but the jury were discharged due to a serious irregularity. The inquest was re-listed before the next available court and resumed before a jury on 30 January 2023, concluding on 10 February 2023.","The following represents the findings of fact returned by the jury: Wyndham Richard Thomas was a prisoner transferred to HMP Nottingham on 29th of October 2018. He had been at HMP Nottingham previously (July – October 2018). Wyndham was serving a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 10 years which commenced on 9th of April 1998. He ligated and was found unconscious in his cell at 18:04 on 4th of November 2018. He had moved prisons a great deal – 13 prisons in the previous 3 years and had transferred from HMP Norwich. This had made it difficult for his family (based in South Wales) to maintain contact. He had been managed on ACCTs many times – 25 ACCTs between 2016 and 2018. Wyndham had also been prescribed medication for anxiety and depression. He began self-harming in 2016 and first ligated on 3rd of October 2016, because of a lack of tobacco. On arrival at HMP Nottingham on 29th of October 2018 he went onto F Wing. During the safer custody interview several triggers were added to his ACCT plan. These were: That he managed his self-harm [REDACTED] That he had a parole decision coming up on the 31st of October which was a cause of stress for Wyndham (parole was refused on the 31st of October) That he had taken [REDACTED] (and so was referred to the substance misuse team) News about his daughter's [REDACTED] which coincided with the anniversary of his sister's [REDACTED]. That he had issues with going onto B wing because of drugs related issues. Wyndham remained on F Wing until 2nd of November and when an officer tried to relocate him from F to B wing Wyndham struck him. At this point (1.30 pm) he was forcibly removed and placed in the segregation unit. An ACCT case review followed at 15:10 during which his healthcare safety segregation paperwork was signed. The Governor's Defensible Decision to Segregate a prisoner on an open ACCT was completed. Wyndham did not receive an assessment of his mental health within 24 hours of segregation. There were no certified safer cells to house Wyndham in, even if they had referred to his history of ligation. No care map was produced, and Wyndham was tasked by the Governor chairing the meeting with writing his goals over the weekend. Wyndham's level of risk was increased from 'low' to 'raised' but his observation was reduced to every 2 hours. There were no measures put in place to reduce his risk of self-harm as there had been no meaningful risk assessment carried out. An officer collected Wyndham's last [REDACTED] from his cell on F wing at 17:30. Wyndham had been asking for access to [REDACTED] and had been refused by the Governor in the afternoon. On Saturday 3rd of November, from early in the morning, Wyndham was pressing the cell bell regularly to request more [REDACTED]. He made a number of demands, one of which was a listener. This was refused and Wyndham rejected the Samaritans phone that was offered. It was a source of ongoing frustration between prison officers and Wyndham. He was 'up and down', becoming verbally aggressive in response to repeated refusals. At 15:30 the Governor carried out his daily review of Wyndham's continuing segregation. Wyndham moved cells in the afternoon. At approximately 18:30 Wyndham showed his escalating frustration by banging his head against the cell window and door. Self-harm, using [REDACTED] was inflicted on Wyndham's left forearm on the site of an earlier wound and the ACCT book was updated at 19:00. Healthcare was called but Wyndham refused treatment and a dressing was passed under the door. As staff were relying on Wyndham's presentation and were unaware of any risk relevant information, no further action was taken and there was no review of Wyndham's ACCT following this self-harm incident. Had the records been consulted at this point the risks would have been apparent. Wyndham was seen the following morning – on Sunday 4th – by a healthcare nurse and around 9:30am the Governor's daily review was carried out, at which point[REDACTED]were again refused. Wyndham made repeated use of the cell bell in the morning to request [REDACTED] . Wyndham was continuing to request vapes and being refused. A radio was provided around 17:00 as a distraction. He was still verbally abusive when his cell bell was answered at 17:45. An officer checked on Wyndham at 17:54 and observed Wyndham for 17 seconds before walking away. Wyndham was standing between the sink and the cell door, almost out of view. He was standing up and breathing although there was no verbal interaction. The officer returned at 18:04, realised that something was amiss and radioed for assistance. He could see the top of Wyndham's head below the observation panel against the door and a ligature running down the side of the observation panel. 3 officers entered the cell at 18:06 and cut the ligature, [REDACTED]. An officer and nurse commenced CPR and a second nurse arrived with the emergency bag at 18:07. A code blue was called but it is not conclusive at what time precisely. Wyndham was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at QMC, at approximately 18:45. On the 6th of November 16:40 Wyndham was pronounced dead.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. There is a lack of local and national system of in-cell ligature point risk assessments, and no ligature point maps available to staff. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The Prison Staff caring for Wyndham were not aware of the location of known ligature points within the cell. This meant that suspicion was not drawn when Wyndham was seen positioned in an area which had access to a ligature point. 2. There is no mandatory requirement for a HMP Prison to have access to a Safer Cell (one with reduced ligature points). HMP Nottingham does not have designated Safer Cells, including on the Care and Support Unit, where prisoners posing a high risk of harm by ligation may be sent for their own safety. The above matters represent missed opportunities to seek to reduce the risk of self-harm and death by ligature asphyxiation, which is one of the most prevalent mechanisms of self-harm and self-inflicted death across the prison estate. While the above measures will not eliminate risk entirely, any reduction in opportunity to ligate may save lives. 6"

CEO, Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust (FPH) 2. CEO, Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SABP) 1","On 4th April 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ryan John EVANS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23rd January 2023. The inquest was heard with a Jury. Mr. EVANS died of: 1a: Asphyxia 1b: Suspension by the neck The jury returned the following narrative conclusion: Narrative conclusion Ryan John Glyn EVANS was a 20 year old man with a global learning delay (a learning disability) and was registered disabled. He had a diagnosis of depression which dates back to 2016. He was physically fit and was living on his own in assisted living with seven hours of support a week. Ryan was adopted at age two along with his older brother and sister and were brought up in a close family unit with his adoptive parents, following a traumatic early childhood. Ryan was vulnerable due to his learning disability and depression, recent self- harm and attempts of suicide. Ryan's mental health had deteriorated over approximately seven months due to a number of contributory factors. Notice to leave his accommodation and uncertainty of future living plans. Finding out the nature of his biological fathers suicide (hanging) via social media Medication, drugs and alcohol Breakdown in relationship with ACASA management Ryan was arrested on 2nd April outside ACASA offices for: -Outstanding criminal damage -Threatening behaviour -Violent / Abusive phone calls Ryan was taken to Frimley Park Hospital by ambulance following collapse in the police van with chest and abdomen pain, his self-harm injuries were dressed and no physical issues were discovered so he was released into police custody. Despite evidence of self-harm, no Mental Health Assessment was carried out at this point. On booking into police custody, Ryan was noticeably upset. He was referred to and visited by a Health Care Professional (HCP) and Hampshire Liaison and Diversion Service (HLDS) at the request of the police custody sergeant. -HCP reviewed his physical condition and redressed his self-harm injury -HLDS failed to document the encounter on the RIO system and only updated the custody record with a screening document. This follows a failure to update the RIO system in January 2018 when Ryan was previously seen by HLDS. There was failure to carry out a Mental Health Assessment and no record of Ryan refusing to be assessed. It could not be concluded that these shortcomings significantly shortened Ryan John Glyn EVANS life. HLDS report screen was completed and uploaded onto the custody record with no reference to a Mental Health Assessment being required or declined by Ryan. Throughout Ryan's stay in custody he expressed suicidal ideations on multiple occasions, spoke to the Samaritans and concerns were raised by family which were reported back to the custody Sergeant. Communication of this information was ineffective. Additionally, across the custody suite there was a sense of complacency with references to Ryan's behaviour being “attention seeking” and no future referrals to HLDS were made. Despite no formal guidance, it is regrettable that on disposal, no verbal handover was done with Ryan's father. It could not be concluded that these shortcomings significantly shortened Ryan John Glyn EVANS life. Ryan was released into the care of his father at approximately 22:30 from Basingstoke Custody Centre. He was in a distressed state over the conditions of his discharge and how he found out about his biological father committing suicide by hanging. Ryan refused to go home to his parents residence and wanted to go to his own accommodation. His father dropped him off around midnight and waited till Ryan was safely in the building. Ryan was found hanging the following morning, 3rd April 2018, by a fellow resident in the communal area of the building. Ryan had a long standing history of depression and several suicide attempts. Ryan John Glyn EVANS took his own life while suffering from the diagnosed medical illness of depression.",The circumstances of the death are recorded in the Jury's Narrative Conclusion.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. The concerns raised were as follows: a. Referral to Psychiatric Liaison Services for patients presenting with self-harm injuries and suicidal ideation (including those in Police custody) at Frimley Park Hospital A&E, including the extent to which the NICE guidance is complied with or provides effective guidance to staff in such circumstances. b. The conduct of Mental Health Assessments in a custody setting by liaison and diversion staff including the adequacy of policy and guidelines relating to triggers to conduct such assessments and the manner in which refusals are dealt with. c. The passage of information both between custody staff, as well as with healthcare staff in relation to concerns of a mental health nature for a detained person including the extent to which the custody record is used as an effective means to communicate concerns/observations of detained persons mental health. d. The process of release of a vulnerable detained person following disposal, including interaction with family or other persons collecting the detained person. I received further evidence in writing from the Interested Persons' subsequent to the completion of the Inquest in relation to these concerns. This evidence included responses from Hampshire Constabulary and Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which have been put in place to address the failures identified during the course of the Inquest with respect to concerns at b – d (above). I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of these Interested Persons. I also received evidence from the Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken in their area of responsibility to address my concern detailed at a (above). This evidence has not allayed my concern in relation to a (above). In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Evidence received from the police officers accompanying Mr. EVANS during his attendance at Frimley Park Hospital provided that: a. Mr. EVANS presented with a large fresh cut on his arm and also cuts on his Ryan John EVANS (26975-2018) legs which were identified by him as being from self-harm with hospital staff noting that the larger mark on the arm might require stitching. b. Police officers stated that Mr. EVANS was open with hospital staff about his feelings of self-harm depression, and thoughts of ending his own life. Officers further recalled that hospital staff noticed and commented on the self-harm marks on Mr. EVANS' arms, including whilst staff were dressing a recent self- harm wound on Mr. EVANS' left arm. c. Officers also recalled Mr. EVANS commenting when offered food by hospital staff that he would rather starve to death. d. One of the accompanying police officers expressed surprise at the fact that Mr. EVANS was not subject to a mental health referral or assessment, in the context of him commenting to multiple hospital staff members about his self-harm actions and ideation. An emergency department consultant at Frimley Park gave evidence which suggested that no mental health assessment was or would have been necessary where Ryan's presenting complaint was recorded as chest pains rather than of self- harm and/or suicidal ideation. Although self-harm had been noted in the records, no explanation could be provided for why Ryan's suicidal ideation had not been recorded. The consultant was further questioned in relation to the 2006 NICE Guidelines “Self-Harm: The short term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care” which are national guidelines that ought to feed into practice at the hospital. These guidelines provide that “Following triage patients who have self-harmed should receive the requisite treatment for their physical condition, undergo risk and full psychosocial needs assessment and mental state examination, and referral for further treatment and care as necessary” and “All people who have self harmed should be offered an assessment of needs, which should be comprehensive and include evaluation of the social, psychological and motivational factors specific to the act of self-harm, current suicidal intent and hopelessness, as well as a full mental health and social needs assessment.” Evidence received during the course of the Inquest was not able to reconcile the contradiction between the NICE guidelines on self-harm and Mr. EVANS having had no mental health assessment despite obvious signs of self-harm and further evidence of disclosure of suicidal ideation. The jury in their Narrative Conclusion found that 'Despite evidence of self-harm, no mental health assessment was carried out at this point.' I remain concerned as to how such a situation would be avoided if a patient presented again in similar manner to Mr. EVANS. The additional evidence on PFD matters provided by Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust does not refer to or address the NICE guidelines on self-harm or explain what would now be done differently were a patient such as Mr. EVANS were to be seen again. The Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust additional evidence refers to matters being in the process of introduction and new referral criteria with Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, but this does not explain how this would prevent the future risk of a patient such as Mr. EVANS leaving the hospital without a mental health assessment.

BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE, 13 Selbie House, Allsop Place, London NW1 5LJ 3. 1","On 12th February 2022, the coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Amanda Susan Hitch, aged 59. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest before me held between 13/12/2023- 15/12/2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion. The deceased died of multiple injuries sustained deliberately jumping in front of a train with the intention to die. The care and treatment of the deceased's mental health needs and risk of suicide were investigated at the inquest.","Amanda Hitch jumped onto railway tracks in front of a train, as I found, deliberately and intending to die, [REDACTED] on 12th February 2022. The risk that she would try to end her life at a station by this means was well known and chronic. She was receiving treatment in the community from a community mental health team under the Essex Partnership University Trust. This included out of hours support by ringing 111 and if thought appropriate, referral to a service called The Sanctuary, which was commissioned by EPUT but operated by people from Mind the mental health charity. The inquest considered the effectiveness of this treatment, and made findings about that in the narrative conclusion.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) During the inquest, it became clear that one significant entry in the clinical notes made by someone in a separate service commissioned by the Essex 2 Partnership University Trust, and which expressed a very specific and imminent intention from the deceased to end her life, was not seen by others in the clinical team. This was almost certainly because the clinical record does not present on computer screens as a continuous chronological running record, but is instead viewed thematically. That means that readers are likely to look at entries made within their particular clinical team, rather than see what others have recorded more recently. There is an obvious risk that critical and important information garnered by others and put into the medical records will not be seen, and that those making clinical decisions on risk management will thus be unaware of potentially very significant information. (2) The evidence was such that neither the care co- Ordinator nor the consultant psychiatrist as the medical lead of the service specifically considered the structured risk management tools that the Trust operates, preferring to rely on clinical experience and judgment alone. There may be a risk that not using such risk management tools in combination with clinical experience and judgment, particularly if this is being done by one clinician at an appointment rather than multidisciplinary discussion of changes in presentation, may lead to information being missed. (3) There was also evidence about the measures that the British Transport Police had taken, seeking to provide additional support by setting up multi- agency support plan, which provided a system for alerting a number of people including the deceased's care- co-ordinator, when she attended at railway stations. In fact, for various reasons, although there are several known attendances at railway stations, none were passed on to the care co- Ordinator. The evidence at the inquest was that British Transport Police does not have the resources always to provide information about attendances at unstaffed stations (although in fact, one such attendance had been known about but was not passed on). The plan as presented does not make it entirely clear what the limitations in relation to information from attendances at unstaffed stations may be, and should it remain the position that BTP lacks the resources to identify all such attendances at railway stations by persons at specific risk of suicide on the railway, there is a risk that those expecting to receive information under such a plan may not realise that the plan will often not assist where its subject is attending unmanned stations. 6"

Chief Executive Officer Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust 2. Chief Executive Officer Essex County Council 1,"On 26 July 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of MORGAN- ROSE HART aged 18. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 December 2023. The conclusion of the jury inquest was 1a Hypoxic Ischaemic Brain Injury 1b Cardiac Arrest 1c Ligature Misadventure Contributed by Neglect Morgan-Rose Hart's transfer to adult services was not supported enough with a clear transfer to ease her anxieties and worries. From the transfer to Chelmer ward Morgan-Rose's medical history, diagnosis and triggers including her communication passport were not filtered down to staff who were tasked to providing her day-to-day care. Morgan-Rose's known triggers and change in behaviour were not observed or documented whilst she was presenting behaviours of her mental health deteriorating. For example, doing her make up, spending more time alone and losing weight. Observations mainly being completed via the Oxevision system apart from the level 3 observations. There was limited therapeutic engagements or attempts to engage with Morgan-Rose. Staff observations being falsified led to Morgan-Rose not being checked and she felt staff did not have time for her. On the day of the 6th July 2022, critical observations were missed, Oxevision alerts were muted or reset without the correct procedures being adhered to, contributed to Morgan-Rose being left unattended in her bathroom for approximately 50 minutes after the Oxevision red alert was reset on display 01, in this time she tied a ligature around her neck. Morgan-Rose expressed she did not want to die but was high risk of self- harm and had a history of ligaturing. It was also documented Morgan-Rose was known to mask her behaviours. When reduced to Level 2 and Level 1 observations the correct risk assessments including room checks were not completed. Resulting in restricted items being easily accessed. This increased the risk of self-harm. The failure of basic protocol and procedure documented by Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust resulted in Morgan-Rose Hart dying by Misadventure Contributed by Neglect.","Morgan Rose died on 12th July 2022 at the Princess Alexander Hospital, Hamstel Road, Harlow, Essex following being found unresponsive on the bathroom floor of her room. Morgan-Rose Hart was detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act at the Derwent Centre on the female ward called Chelmer. Morgan-Rose had tied a ligature around her neck which resulted in a Cardiac Arrest and then Hypoxic Ischaemic Brain Injury. Morgan-Rose Hart was pronounced dead on the 12th July 2022 after brain stem testing confirmed Morgan-rose Hart had sustained Irreversible Brian Injury. On 6th July 2022 events contributed to Morgan-Rose's mental health deterioration. Morgan-Rose was not observed clinically since 14:06 and the time in between the last observation and when Morgan-Rose was discovered multiple failings occurred. These include non-clinical and clinical staff commenting on her appearance, a delivery of flowers triggering a response, observation Level 1 missed the following hour, as well as the consecutive hours observations also being incorrect and falsified. Other events during the day triggered an emotional response clinical staff reflecting unescorted leave and no therapeutic engagement was made to see if Morgan-Rose was okay. After the delivery of the flowers incorrectly delivered to Morgan-Rose. Morgan- Rose attempted to contact relatives to clarify who these were from as there was some confusion as to who the flowers were for. The flowers were not meant for Morgan-Rose. Whilst Morgan-Rose was in the bedroom multiple attempts were made to interact with the Oxevision system to check vital signs, although the system could not access this due to the tile being Amber stating that Morgan-Rose was in the bathroom. Regardless of the Oxevision no member of staff attempted a physical welfare check until she was discovered unresponsive on the bathroom floor, in the shower, fully clothes at 16:20:37, confirmed on CCTV records. Staff proceeded to perform CPR and resuscitation until paramedics arrived at 16:27. Morgan- rose was left unattended for approximately 50 minutes prior to being found with the ligature around her neck. Morgan's last physical check was at 14:06. Morgan-Rose had not had recorded observations for 2 hours and 14 minutes according to CCTV footage.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 3 Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. (1) The Trust investigation was materially incomplete and there was a lost an opportunity to: a. Understand concerns of the Family b. Acknowledge errors and learn lessons from the circumstances of the death. The Director of Operations and Matron informed the Trust Senior Management that the PSII Report had omissions. The Trust evidence was that it was an early adopter of the new NHS investigation process. The lead investigator did not report on material issues as to how Morgan-Rose was observed on the ward and the report was significantly delayed. Evidence was there was a pressure to sign the report off although it remained incomplete and did not contain a note about the limitations. c. d. Escalate concerns about staff observations - About 2 weeks after the death the Matron received a report that staff observations had not been appropriately conducted. This prompted a review of CCTV from the afternoon of Morgan-Rose's death. There was insufficient scrutiny of the CCTV that showed that multiple observations entries made on 6 July 2022 after 14:06 hours could not be correct. e. Understand security issues on a locked mental health ward - It has not been possible to establish the identity of the person that reset the bathroom alert triggered for Morgan-Rose on 6 July 2022 at 15:31. The Trust does not have an accurate records of Trust staff pass allocation. The Trust investigation did not establish that staff borrowed each other's security passes. On the day of Morgan-Rose's death a visitor pass issued that had access to the nursing office. The Trust was unable to provide the identity of this person. (2) There was a dispute in evidence over whether it was or was not permitted for patients to have belts on Chelmer Ward, that has not been resolved. a. Morgan-Rose was on 1:1 observation due to her high risk of self- harm that including ligaturing and a belt was in her possession b. The Responsible Clinician and a Ward Manager providing support to 4 staff gave evidence at that time that belts were not permitted c. The Trust senior management stated that belts were permitted and referenced the policy. The Updated ward documentation 'Handover Checklist' approved in October 2023 contains belts on a list of prohibited items. The Trust has stated that this is not correct although this was part of the After-Action Review and is in current use. (3) Escalation of risk – Morgan-Rose attempted to secure unescorted leave on the morning of her death, her Responsible Clinician had only authorised escorted leave. This was not escalated to the nurse in charge and the Responsible Clinician was not informed. (4) Bathroom alerts – Evidence was heard that an Oxevision alert is triggered if a person is in the bathroom for more than 3 minutes and staff are required to complete an in-person check. Morgan-Rose was left in the bathroom unobserved for approximately 50 minutes. It was not clear from the evidence how the Trust proposes to ensure compliance in respect of this duty. (5) Trust oversight of care – the quality of record keeping was acknowledged not to be appropriate by nurses and senior staff during evidence, yet had been signed off: a. Observations sheets for vulnerable detained mental patients were signed off by nurses in charge as being appropriate despite an absence of any recorded therapeutic engagement b. Omissions in the recording of food and fluid charts required by the Responsible Clinician for a patient who was losing weight with a diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder. c. The Responsible Clinician's evidence was that the absence of appropriate food and fluid charts for other patients was an ongoing issue on Chelmer Ward that had been raised with nursing staff (6) Staff entries in patient observations sheets should have given rise to a concern that some staff may have been using Oxevision not just as an adjunct to face-to-face observations, but instead of them. This remains a concern. 5 Essex County Council (7) There is a significant shortfall of appropriate placements for people with Autism who have mental health and self-harm risks in Essex both inpatient and the community. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest with a jury on the 13th to 17th day of November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Mr Willis died from hanging and the narrative conclusion was that: “Mr Martin Willis took his own life, in part because the risk of him doing so was not reported, communicated and the precautions in place were insufficient to prevent him doing so whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed”.",Mr Willis was a serving prisoner at HMP Stoke Heath when at 8:37 am on the 15 th September 2022 he was found hanging in his cell. He was on the suicide and self-harm prevention scheme (ACCT).,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The ACCT procedure was not properly implemented, complied with or supervised. A scheduled observation at 8 am did not take place and a false entry was entered at 7:30 am and later deleted. The last correct entry was at 7 am with earlier omissions. 2. The prison service has taken action to address the issues relating to the ACCT procedure and will be kept under review. 3. Overriding issues remain as to whether or not the late Mr Willis was on the correct levels of observation up to constant watch and whether he should have been transferred out on psychiatric grounds for treatment at another prison establishment with a hospital wing. 4. Whilst the prison service and the mental health providers have reviewed the circumstances of Mr Willis's death, I am concerned that there should be a collective and not individual response to ensure that all lessons can be learned. I therefore recommend that there be an inter-agency review between the prison service and mental health services as to the mental health care provided to the late Mr Willis including the evidence at the inquest and the jury's findings. In so doing, I do not purport to suggest what the outcome of the review should be. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 December 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was one of suicide.,"Olivia Russell had a history of anxiety which was initial managed without medication. In October 2020 she contacted your surgery and discussed options to treat her anxiety as this had worsened. She initially decided against anti-depressants but subsequently had another appointment on 2 November where she opted for a 10mg dose of citalopram. Following a period of apparent stability, Olivia stopped taking her medication in or around June 2021 without consulting a GP, subsequently suffering a relapse and re-starting her medication in August 2021. Sadly, Olivia took her own life on 19 September 2021.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the inquest, evidence was heard from , one of your salaried GPs as to his interactions with Olivia, and based on the records, his colleagues' interactions. There was no evidence within the notes that the risk of relapse if a medication is stopped was discussed in either November 2020 or August 2021, nor is there evidence that Olivia was told she may feel worse before she feels better. I did not find that this advice was not given, simply that I could not say either way. When asked, evidence was that you would discuss the risks when prescribing the drug, but was not entirely clear as to which risks he would discuss, and gave evidence that it is likely each GP has a different approach, bearing in mind the time limitations of the appointment. He could not say with confidence that every GP within the practice was discussing these key risks. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 A copy of the relevant NICE guidance was provided to me which states that these risks should be discussed with the patient, and I look specifically at sections 1.3.1 and 1.5.2 as a minimum. I am concerned that this guidance is not being followed as a matter of routine within the surgery and that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths. I am also concerned that a significant event meeting (acknowledging I may have the name of this review meeting incorrect) has not yet taken place, despite Olivia's death being over 2 years ago. The evidence of was that this will take place after the inquest and I am concerned that, if this is the practice following all deaths, there is a risk that learning from deaths will be delayed or missed. 6"

Secretary of State for Education, the Rt Hon Gillian Keegan 3. Chief executive of Reading Borough Council, 1","The family requested me to refer to the deceased as Ruth. I will reflect that in this report. I conducted an inquest into the death of Ruth Carla Perry which concluded on 7th of December 2023. I recorded a narrative conclusion as follows: Suicide, contributed to by an Ofsted inspection carried out in November 2022.","This was the first Ofsted inspection that Caversham Primary School ('CPS') had had for 13 years. There was previously a policy which meant that schools which had been rated outstanding were not inspected in line with usual timescales. There was a policy change in 2021, and CPS was therefore due an inspection. This was the reason for the inspection in November 2022. CPS underwent an Ofsted inspection on the 15th and 16th of November 2022, after receiving a phone call to notify them of this at 1pm on 14th November 2022. Ruth's mental health deteriorated significantly during and after the inspection. She displayed suicidal ideation and planning a few days after the inspection. She sought mental health support, but felt unable to discuss the likely outcome of the inspection in any detail. Ruth had no relevant past mental health history. The records and evidence set out very clearly what the cause of her mental health deterioration was. She took her own life on 8th January 2023. Other findings which I made in this case included: 1. I referred in questioning to hypothetical schools A and B. Hypothetical school A is good in all areas, but there are safeguarding concerns which can be remedied quickly. Hypothetical school B is dreadful in all respects. The system as it currently stands will mean that these 2 hypothetical schools will receive the same overall label of 'inadequate'. For maintained schools, both would face possible academisation and job losses. 2. The lead inspector told the chair of governors that CPS had a robust safeguarding culture and that all children felt safe. We heard different estimates for how long the inspection team believed the safeguarding issues identified would take to remedy. The longest of these was 30 working days. 3. Parts of the Ofsted inspection were conducted in a manner which lacked fairness, respect and sensitivity (these are the terms used in Ofsted's Code of Conduct). This likely had an effect on Ruth's ability to deal fully with the inspection process. It is very important to stress here that, although I necessarily had to consider the conduct of the inspectors in this matter, the focus should not be on any individual inspector, but more on the system, policies and training. 4. There is very little training by Ofsted, and no written policy, regarding management of school leader anxiety during inspections. 5. The suggestion that an inspection could be paused for reason of school leader distress was not part of Ofsted's policy or training. 6. Ofsted's confidentiality requirements (between inspection and final publication of the report) was a significant issue for Ruth. 7. Ruth's employer, Reading Borough Council, clearly felt that Ofsted's decision was wrong and unfair, but did not provide any comment on the draft report, despite asking for the opportunity to do so. 8. The legal test I have to apply is whether I consider it is likely that the Ofsted inspection contributed more than minimally to Ruth's mental health deterioration and death. I found that it did contribute. 9. An unfavourable inspection outcome in itself would be distressing to a headteacher. However, whilst the outcome of the inspection was a part of Ruth's distress, it was not the only cause. I remain concerned about: a. The conduct of the inspection itself. b. The current Ofsted system which allows for the single word judgement of 'inadequate' to be applied equally to a school rated otherwise good, but with issues that could be remedied by the time the report was published, as to a school which is dreadful in all respects. c. The confidentiality requirement at the time. d. The length of time between the inspection and final report, thus lengthening the period of the confidentiality requirement.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. I appreciate that some of the issues of concern are outside the gift of Ofsted, and that is part of the reason for including the Department for Education as a recipient of this report. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) In relation to Ofsted and/or the Department for Education 1. The first of these relates to my hypothetical schools A and B point, referred to above. I am concerned about the impact on school leader welfare that this system may continue to have. Transparency and ease of message to parents is not currently weighed against teacher welfare. The current system allows a school which is inadequate in all areas to receive the same overall label as a school which is good in all areas, but with some safeguarding issues which can be repaired by the time the report is published. Regulation 28 – Before Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2020 2. There is an almost complete absence of Ofsted training or published policy in the following areas: a. Signs of distress in school leaders during an inspection (this will be obvious to some, but not to all). b. Practical steps to deal with such distress. c. Pausing an inspection by reason of the distress of a school leader. d. Who can attend meetings with the inspectors during the inspection process. 3. Absence of a clear path to raise concerns during an inspection if these cannot be resolved directly with the lead inspector. 4. The confidentiality requirement after an inspection. Some changes have been made already, but this is not yet written into policy. Given how long this policy has been in place, school leaders may fear discussing outcomes with colleagues outside of the school, and mental health professionals, unless this is expressly dealt with in written policy. 5. Timescales for report publication. 6. No learning review of these matters was conducted by Ofsted. There is no policy requiring this to be done. 7. In an Ofsted publication dated 12th of June 2023, the Secretary of State for Education was quoted as follows: “We must ensure our school leaders have the support they need, which is why today we are significantly expanding our wellbeing support. This expansion will help make sure headteachers have access to support whenever they need it”. The Ofsted witness was not able to clarify what form this additional support has taken. Reading Borough Council 1. Reading Borough Council indicated an intention to adopt a much more robust and proactive approach to dealing with Ofsted, particularly where there are concerns about an inspection. This is not in written policy or guidance – which may go some way towards reassuring school leaders that their employer 'has their back' – both now and in future years. 2. Reading Borough Council also did not carry out any form of internal review. I was not made aware of any policy setting out when such an internal review should take place. 3.

This is a national problem and sadly leads to Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 many experiencing unnecessary admissions to inpatient mental health facilities and also A&E attendances. Despite a report from the Health and Social Care committee from 2021 this case showed that there does not seem to have been any real improvement and more lives are likely to be lost. Reading from this report, it says “The conclusion of this report was that Autistic people (and people with learning disabilities) have the right to live independent, free, and fulfilled lives in the community and it is an unacceptable violation of their human rights to deny them the chance to do so.” The report identified that “the community support and provision for autistic people (and those with learning difficulties) and financial investment in those services is significantly below the level required to meet the needs of those individuals and to provide adequate support for them in the community. “ The Inquest heard that two years on there still remains an acute shortage of provision. Evidence was heard that East Sussex Council had tried over 30 providers to help put in place support for Jessie but they could not find a placement for her so the only provision that they were able to offer her was supported housing with temporary care agency staff. This provision broke down which exsacerbated Jessie's mental health. This then led to a Hosptial mental inpatient admisssion. 6"

While being treated in hospital, the deceased obtained psychology treatment in the form of a series of sessions with a trainee psychologist with whom she built a good clinical relationship and from which she reported benefiting significantly. Following her discharge from hospital, this psychology treatment effectively came to an end, since the procedures for receiving this treatment in the community were passed to an entirely separate set of clinicians. There was an entirely separate procedure for referral and provision of psychology sessions, with a very significant wait, and the deceased never in fact secured access to those services in the months between being discharged (in May 2022) and her death in October 2022.

On 30 December there was a joint review by the Home Treatment Team and Haringey (BEH) Early Intervention Service (EIS) at St Ann's Hospital and Zee was allocated a care coordinator.

In February 2023 Zee's mental health deteriorated. On 15 February he reported EIS that he was experiencing negative side effects from his medication but that he felt mostly optimistic. He requested a reduction of olanzapine. There was an exchange of text messages between Zee and a dual diagnosis recovery worker between 17 February and 15 March in which Zee appeared upbeat, said that he was attending work and gave no cause for the recovery worker to be concerned. On 16 March Zee attended an appointment and informed his recovery worker that he had stopped taking his olanzapine and fluoxetine 2 weeks previously due to numbness that had led to suicidal ideation. The recovery worker went out of his way to arrange an urgent medical review for Monday 20 March. Zee was given safety netting advice.

She died having taken intentional overdose of [REDACTED] on 15 May 2021, and as a result of subsequent hospital care and treatment provided to her for that overdose and associated complications. The inquest concluded on 23 November 2023 with the following narrative conclusion: “Katie Anne Williams died on 24 May 2021 from serotonin toxicity caused by an overdose of [REDACTED] and hospital administered [REDACTED] .” In Box 3 of the record of inquest: “Katie Anne Williams died on 24 May 2021 at Derriford Hospital. On 16 May 2021, she took an overdose of [REDACTED] . She was admitted to hospital where she was treated for this overdose and associated complications, including an aspiration pneumonia and paralytic ileus. [REDACTED] was initially withheld given the risk of serotonin toxicity, but re-introduced on day four of her ICU stay, as the period of risk for serotonin toxicity was felt to have passed. Sadly, as a result of the paralytic ileus Katie had developed, the absorption of modified release was delayed. This, in combination with [REDACTED] administered in the ICU caused a re- precipitation of serotonin toxicity which was ultimately fatal.” The medical cause of death was recorded at the inquest as: 1a) Circulatory failure 1b) Serotonin toxicity 1c) Drug overdose As part of the inquest it was found as a matter of fact that the [REDACTED] administered by the ICU team in the hospital (as part of their standard procedure for sedating intubated patients) had caused a reprecipitation of the serotonin toxicity which was previously thought to have resolved. This was thought to have occurred because the patient had developed a paralytic ileus which had delayed the absorption of the modified release [REDACTED] she had taken prior to her admission. This caused or contributed to Katie's death. Following this case the University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust (the “Trust”) has amended its sedation policy such that lower risk opiates (such as morphine) are recommended for sedating patients who are admitted following overdose of medications like venlafaxine, to reduce the risk of reprecipitating serotonin toxicity.","On 15 May 2021 Katie Anne WILLIAMS took an overdose of her prescribed [REDACTED]. She had taken [RED CTED] modified release tablets. Equivalent to 56 days' worth of this prescribed medication. She was taken to Derriford Hospital by ambulance in the early hours of 16 May 2021 where she was reviewed in the emergency department and then shortly afterwards admitted to ICU. On arrival at the emergency department, Katie was recognised to be extremely unwell. She was unconscious with a GCS of 3 as a result of her overdose. She had also had a number of seizures on her way to the hospital, and prior to the ambulance arrival. She required intubation and ventilation to protect her airway and stabilise her condition. A chest x-ray was undertaken which demonstrated evidence of an aspiration. Katie also had a temperature of 40°c on admission to the emergency department; this, and the evidence of early muscle injury, led the treating ICU team to conclude that Kate was likely to be suffering with serotonin toxicity. Given the ongoing risk of serotonin toxicity, and following Toxbase advice, no infusion of the opiate drug [REDACTED was administered to Katie during days 1, 2 or 3 of her ICU admission. At this stage, the venlafaxine was felt to still to be her system, and the plan was to support Katie whilst this cleared, and to treat her evolving aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics. Where additional sedation was required remifentanil was used. On day 4 of Katie's ICU admission (19 May 2021) a decision was made to switch the remifentanil infusion to a [REDACTED] infusion as per usual ICU practice. In the following days Katie's kidney function continue to normalise. There was no recurrence of a hyperpyrexia, or any other clinical features to suggest a recurrence of the serotonin syndrome. The rationale for moving to [REDACTED] was that from day three onwards it was felt that the majority of the venlafaxine would have been metabolised by the body and therefore the risk of interaction with any other drugs such as fentanyl would not have been a significant concern. [REDACTED] was infused on an hourly basis in accordance with usual practice and tolerance of the drug was monitored based on clinical effect, including considering a patient's tolerance of the ET tube and interrupting the infusion on a regular basis to check for drug accumulation. Sadly, over the next few days, Katie's condition deteriorated. A CT scan confirmed the appearances of severe aspiration pneumonia and a paralytic ileus. The concern at day five was the evolving severe aspiration pneumonia. Katie was now severely ill. As a result of this she required ventilating in the prone position. Prone ventilation required heavy sedation and as such the [REDACTED] infusion was increased to 5ml/hr. At this stage, it was felt that the [REDACTED] poisoning had passed. Over the coming days Katie's condition improved, and she was able to be managed once again in the standard supine position. The [REDACTED] infusion was reduced from 5 ml/hour to 3 ml/hour. She was having regular sedation breaks from which she was rousing quickly which meant that the infusion could not be further reduced. Again at this stage, the risk of an ongoing serotonin toxicity was not considered to be an issue. Katie had also developed a paralytic ileus. In Katie's case the paralytic ileus (it appears) delayed the absorption of the modified release [REDACTED]. This meant that the ICU team treating her at the time felt that the [REDACTED] had cleared from her system, and that it was therefore safe to introduce [REDACTED]. With the benefit of hindsight, and having seen the toxicology report, it appears that that was not the case; Katie still had a significant amount of [REDACTED] in her system. I am told there is no way of monitoring these levels in life. In the morning of 24 May 2021 Katie appeared to be improving. She was reviewed on the ward round at 11am. She was haemodynamically stable, requiring no drugs to support her blood pressure. He abdomen remained distended, but there was no particular clinical concern for this at the time the plan was to continue with supportive care in the expectation she would continue to improve in the days ahead. Very sadly however, and suddenly, Katie's condition began to deteriorate at around 1pm that day. Her blood pressure began to drop and a noradrenaline infusion was commenced. Over the course of the afternoon her blood chemistry steadily deteriorated, reflecting her increasingly shocked state. Her oxygen requirement increased and she developed a severe refractory, circulatory failure and associated pulmonary oedema. Initially the team thought that Katy had become septic and that there might be an acute pathology such as a bowel ischemia or perforation. It was therefore decided to take Katie for a CT scan. However, sadly, whilst preparing Katy for transfer to the CT scanner she went into cardiac arrest. Attempts were made to resuscitate her over the following 40 minutes, but there was no reversible cause for the cardiac arrest that could be identified. Katy did not respond and resuscitation efforts ceased at 19:10 hours. Retrospectively, treating clinicians have considered the cause for Katie's collapse on 24 May 2021. Having reviewed the toxicology report they are of the view that the paralytic ileus delayed the absorption of the modified release [REDACTED]. This, combined with the[REDACTED] (that was used as a sedative drug in accordance with standard practice in the ICU setting) had reprecipitated a serotonin toxicity, which caused Katie to collapse on the 24 May 2021. It is their view that Katie's death was caused by a very unusual and rare presentation of a serotonin toxicity that occurred as a result of the delayed absorption of the [REDACTED], because of the paralytic ileus, and an idiosyncratic reaction between the [REDACTED] and the [REDACTED]. Following Katie's death, the ITU team has amended its sedation policy such that [REDACTED] would now be replaced with morphine in cases such as Katie's, where patients presenting with a [REDACTED] (or similar) where there is an ongoing risk of serotonin toxicity.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The administration of from day four of Katie's hospital admission reprecipitated her serotonin syndrome and directly contributed to her death. The Trust has recognised this and amended its sedation policy to recommend ""lower risk"" opiates (such as morphine) are used in patients who have taken overdoses of medications where there is a risk of serotonin syndrome / toxicity. It is accepted that the way the interacted in this case was unexpected, and appears to have occurred due to the particular circumstances of Katie's case; in particular an aspiration pneumonia requiring treatment in the prone position, and the development of a paralytic ileus. However, these complications are not unusual in patients who have taken overdoses of these types of medications and as such I consider there is a risk a future death may occur in similar circumstances. I am concerned that other NHS organisations may not fully appreciate the risks associated with the use of in patients such as Katie and that this information should be shared with those organisations on a national level. 6"

In May 2023 he was diagnosed with adult autism. At a review on 31 May he was considered to be stable. On 15th June a routine clozapine review identified sub-therapeutic levels but this was not notified to his clinicians. Sub-therapeutic levels of clozapine are likely to have contributed to a worsening in his symptoms. Around 24th June he was noted to have suffered a significant deterioration – with symptoms of thought disorder, anxiety, and responding to hallucinations – and following a mental health act assessment on 28th June clinicians wanted to detain him under section 2. No inpatient psychiatric bed was available. Whilst he awaited a bed, he remained in the community with daily visits from the mental health team.

The Patient Safety Manager gave evidence that the lack of psychiatric bed capacity remains an ongoing problem and has not been resolved, and there is a genuine risk of the same problem with another patient in the future. 3. added there was an exceptional process, which required a considered decision at a high level, to make a bed available through identifying someone currently occupying a bed space to be discharged. In my view, this process is unsatisfactory as it creates a different set of risks around the patient being discharged, and amplifies the chronic shortage of beds. 4. There was reference to two preceding Regulation 28 Reports to Prevent Future Deaths (both available publicly on the judiciary website) that focussed on the chronic lack of mental health resources in Birmingham and Solihull. In relation to the specific issue of a lack of psychiatric bed capacity, in the case of Peter Fleming (no bed was available in August 2022) BSMHFT's response (September 2023) referred to their response in the earlier case of Leroy Hamilton (no bed was available in December 2021). This response (April 2023) stated more resources had been obtained and a collaborative plan had been implemented with NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board. The issue of adequately funding psychiatric beds is a local and national issue. Locally, BSMHFT require their commissioners to provide the necessary funding. My principal concern is that the above dates indicate available psychiatric bed capacity in Birmingham and Solihull remains inadequate. Whilst some action may have been taken it is insufficient to resolve the problem. It follows there is a genuine risk of future deaths directly connected to a shortage of psychiatric bed spaces in Birmingham and Solihull unless further action is taken. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Suicide,"John Joseph Singleton [REDACTED] with a history of depression following significant family bereavements and epilepsy secondary to a head injury. Compliance with medications for these conditions had previously been sporadic. John had a history of previous incarcerations when he arrived at HMP Risley in May 2019 to serve a 10 month sentence for attempted burglary. In August 2019 John began acting bizarrely, had fixed thoughts of persecution and paranoia but did not disclose any thought of self-harm or suicide ideation. Periods of intermittent self-isolation followed these paranoid thoughts. An Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork document was initiated on Saturday 31st August 2019 to identify the issues, offer support and put monitoring in place, but John's mental health continued to deteriorate. On 1st September 2019 during the prison transition period from night to day state, John was on his own in his locked cell [REDACTED] with the intention of ending his life. At 7:56am access to the cell was gained and John was found hanging [REDACTED]. The ligature was cut to release John and appropriate emergency response made. Upon arrival paramedics took over emergency care, obtained a cardiac output and transferred John to Warrington Hospital where he later died on the 10th September 2019 at 17:25. Aspects of the systems relating to medicines non-compliance and mental health referrals at HMP Risley were lacking but did not cause or contribute to John's death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the inquest it came to light that John was prescribed medications for depression and epilepsy whilst incarcerated. His compliance with medications was found to be sporadic and as a result he failed to collect a number of prescriptions to enable continuity of his medication. Some of the reasons around this were anxiety in attending to collect his medications and also periods of self-isolation. Whilst Healthcare at the prison were aware of some of the periods of non-compliance and in fact a GP referral and action was taken to enable John to have weekly in-possession medication to support his compliance, other periods were not flagged or identified and it became clear that monitoring those prisoners who are not medication compliant, particularly if receiving weekly or monthly medication was challenging due to the SystmOne electronic patient system not being able to flag a warning for non-compliant prisoners for early identification and referral. John subsequently suffered a decline in his mental health and whilst the lack of medication compliance was not deemed to cause or contribute to his death, the importance of consistent medication for medical conditions and early identification of prisoners who do not comply was an issue which was raised and explored within the inquest. The action taken by the prison after John's suicide was to put a cross check system in place by which pharmacy technicians cross reference the medication by way of a weekly stock check to identify the prisoners who have not collected medications or had the same dispensed, so that referrals can be made to the Healthcare team and or GP to task. Such a system is less than ideal as it is both resource heavy, carries real risks of not being accurate and in the Coroners view, for prisoners in possession of medication, there is likely to be a much longer period before non-compliance is identified which carries real risks of fatalities. The inquest touched upon the SystmOne electronic record used across the Prison estates by Healthcare. From the evidence it appears that the system has a facility to flag concerns and tasks to action and in fact, certain flags are generated automatically to alert healthcare staff to live issues around a prisoner, however, something as simple and the system generating a warning flag to identify when medication is not dispensed or collected was neither possible nor available on the current operating system. An automated flag alert via the system upon the failure to dispense or collect medication by a prisoner would be a far more efficient and effective way in which prisoners failing to comply with medications could be identified and actioned quickly and in which future deaths could be prevented. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7th August 2023. The inquest was heard without a Jury. Madeleine died of: 1a. Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy 1b. Asphyxiation by Hanging I returned the following narrative conclusion: Madeleine Savory died as a result of Suicide whilst suffering from the effects of a mental health illness. Madeleine's death probably was more than minimally contributed to by the failure of East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust to implement relevant policies which specifically dealt with the management of children such as Madeleine. This led to; a. Staff on Bergholt Ward not having the necessary understanding of Madeleine's risk and how to manage this. b. Ongoing failures to conduct risk assessments for Madeleine. During the time of Madeleine's admission there were only three risk assessments conducted and these were conducted on an ad hoc basis. c. Ongoing failure to ensure relevant information about Madeleine's level of risk and the management of this was communicated to all staff involved in Madeleine's care. This included the recognition and communication of the fact that the bathroom posed a particular risk for Madeleine. There was a failure on the part of Northgate High School to effectively implement the safety plan for Madeleine which was designed to keep Madeleine safe during school hours. The result of this failure meant Madeleine was able to leave school undetected and engage in a self-harm act which resulted in their admission to hospital. This failure possibly more than minimally contributed to Madeleine's death. The lack of resources available to enable the timely allocation to Madeleine of a Tier 4 bed in a paediatric mental health facility possibly more than minimally contributed to Madeleine's death.,"Madeleine Savory was 15 years old when they died. Although not formally diagnosed with a mental health illness, at the time of their death clinicians were considering a working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. Madeleine had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both becoming acute in early February 2022. Madeleine was known to the Child and Young Persons Mental Health Service and to the Paediatric Ward at Ipswich Hospital. All organisations concerned with Madeleine's care had knowledge of their history of suicidal ideation. On the 3rd February 2022 Madeleine absconded undetected from their school and carried out an act of self-harm which resulted in their hospitalisation. They were subsequently identified as needing a Tier 4 Bed admission on a paediatric mental health ward. Measures were put in place for such a bed to be sourced. At the time of Madeleine's death a bed was neither identified nor allocated to Madeleine. During Madeleines admission on Bergholt Ward at Ipswich Hospital they were assessed as being a high risk of self-harm. Their mood fluctuated and on occasions Madeleine presented with no indication of either suffering from low mood or suicidal ideation. Throughout this period of time Madeleine's presentation was complex and reflected the working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. A risk assessment on the 12th February 2022 identified the need for additional measures in managing Madeleine's risk which included mental health observations. These measures were ceased on or around the 14th February 2022. The rationale behind why these measures were ceased is unclear. On the 19th February 2022, during the evening Bergholt Ward shift, Madeleine appeared settled and an earlier episode of distress during the day seemed to have no further impact on them. At around 22:05 pm Madeleine made their way to the bathroom securing the door behind them. They were not observed by ward staff entering the bathroom and there was a period of up to ten minutes during which Madeleine's precise whereabouts was unknown. At around 22:20 pm the evening shift Nurse-in-Charge on Bergholt Ward was informed that Madeleine had been in the bathroom for at least ten minutes and was concerned that this period of time was longer than expected. Measures taken to rouse Madeleine by knocking on the door or calling out to them produced no response. Staff subsequently entered the bathroom and found that Madeleine had ligatured themself. Resuscitation efforts resulted in a return of spontaneous circulation and Madeleine was transferred to the Intensive Treatment Unit at Ipswich Hospital. However, Madeleine had suffered a fatal hypoxic brain injury and they sadly passed away on the 26th February 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. I heard further evidence from the Interested Persons' at a separate hearing on 17th October 2023 in relation to these concerns. At this hearing I received evidence from both East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust and Northgate High School concerning the measures they had put in place to address the failures identified during the course of the Inquest. I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of these Interested Persons and which had arisen from the Inquest. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 I also received helpful evidence from the East of England Provider Collaborative concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken in their area of responsibility to address my concern in relation to the availability and allocation of Tier 4 beds in a paediatric mental health facilities to children such as Madeleine. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. The availability, nationally, of Tier 4 beds in paediatric mental health facilities to allow for the timely allocation to children in need of care in such facilities such as Madeleine Savory. 6"

Chief Executive Depaul UK Sherborne House 4 Decima Street London SE1 4QQ 1,"On 15 May 2023, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Igor Szalapski, aged 18 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 November 2023. I apologise for the delay in the provision of this report. At inquest, I made a determination of death by suicide.","Igor hanged himself in his room at the Depaul London Youth Hub (a hostel for homeless young people) on Sunday, 30 April 2023.","2 During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. On 28 March 2023, Igor refused to get out of the shower . Hostel staff took various actions, including calling the crisis team. The crisis team decided that Igor did not need daily visits, but told staff to call back if there was any change or further concern. 1. On 14 April 2023, staff found Igor outside, drowsy and incoherent, cold and wet, but did not re-contact the crisis team. 2. Igor was a vulnerable young man, recently homeless, but the last time that any member of staff had a meaningful conversation with him was on 20 April 2023, ten days before he died. 3. The Depaul executive director of services recognised at inquest that there should have been more staff conversation with Igor throughout his time at the London Youth Hub. 4. She also acknowledged that greater attempts should have been made by staff to engage with partner agencies regarding Igor's care and welfare. 5. Igor was only 18 years old and his father did visit him, but the hostel did not have any contact details for his family. I heard evidence at inquest that Depaul conducted an internal investigation into Igor's death. The fact of the report was not disclosed to my office in advance of the inquest as it should have been, and I did not see it until it was mentioned in evidence at the inquest. However, I have read the report since. It went into some detail and identified that, when Igor was found at 6.25pm, no staff member had undertaken a welfare check of him since half past midnight, whereas there should have been at least one per shift. I was told at inquest that staff were disciplined about this after Igor's death. At the time of Igor's death, there was no national policy on when to increase welfare checks. I was told that there is now national guidance. The Depaul investigation also identified that staff at the London Youth Hub had not attended self harm and suicide awareness training. I heard that training has now increased and is mandatory. The report described the culture at the London Youth Hub as chaotic. 3 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9th November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide Box 3 of the record of inquest read: On 5th December 2022, Elizabeth Anne WATSON “Lizzie”, jumped [REDACTED] She was declared deceased [REDACTED]. Lizzie was 33 years of age. Her medical cause of death was recorded as: 1a Extensive External And Internal Injuries 1b Fall From Height","Elizabeth Anne Watson “Lizzie” was intelligent and fun-loving. She trained as a primary school teacher. Lizzie began to suffer from anxiety and sleeping problems. Her mental health declined in 2019 causing her to become withdrawn from friends and work. In September 2022 it was agreed with her husband that their relationship was over and but they remained living in the same house by arrangement. On 3rd December 2022 there was a substantive argument. It was agreed that her husband would leave the house. The following day the couple talked. While the breakdown of the relationship was distressing it was believed that the situation had settled and decisions had been made. Lizzie appeared calm, she informed family members she would not be going to work the next day as she wanted to rest. On Monday 5th December 2022 Lizzie attended the Humber Bridge. Security staff in the control room monitored her for a matter of minutes but before assistance was requested from colleagues to approach Lizzie she jumped from the bridge, landing on Cliff Road. Lizzie was declared dead at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) During evidence the matter of monitoring people who attend the bridge in mental health distress was raised. There is a minimum of 2 staff in the control room and 3 staff covering “traffic duties” on the ground. The security staff at the bridge deal with a variety of security issues however this report only seeks to address their role in relation to those suffering from mental health distress. The staff are expected to identify and monitor any person of concern entering the walkways of the bridge. This involves looking at their actions, mannerisms, behaviour and body language. Staff are expected to identify those who may require assistance and contact staffing colleagues to approach them. It appeared there was no structured training policy in place to ensure that staff are given appropriate training to deal with identifying vulnerable people. On joining, staff have an 8 weeks mentoring course, whereby an experienced colleague shows them the role and advises on what to look for. Staff may also undertake an on line suicide prevention course and mental health first aid at work as well as safety harness/working at height training. However there appeared to be no structure to any of the training for this vital role and of more concern there was no input from a trained medical professional with significant 3 knowledge of working with those suffering from mental health crisis. Nor was there any current input with regard to how to talk and negotiate with people in crisis. I was informed that there were many very competent staff who had good intuition, but I have concerns that without appropriate and structured input from a health care professional, any experience on the job is based on unstable foundations. It was evident that the role is vitally important in identifying those at risk and seeking the appropriate help. Without receiving knowledge from someone trained in mental health, having a substantive input on negotiation and how to interact with those in crisis then the difficult job of assessing people and reacting appropriately with them becomes very difficult. (2) While the “Right Care/Right Person” process appears to ensure that the correct emergency service should respond if called, delays in response means often staff are left dealing with a vulnerable person for many hours due to unavailability of emergency services or mental health support. (3) I am aware that there is a Suicide Prevention Meeting where a multi-agency approach can be taken to address the reduction of suicide . I consider that this may be the correct forum to recognise the unique role the staff play and implement a structured training plan with all agencies input for any person beginning work in that role. (4) I was informed in evidence that a vulnerable person is escorted off the bridge everyday – this shows the extent of the problem and the staff to be provided with the very best training available. I echo the views of Lizzie's family when talking about the role that the Security Staff have “there is so much responsibility on someone's head, for them to decide whether someone is likely to jump or not”. I feel that these people should be given a specific set training plan to help them do what is a vital and important role. 6"

On 26 March 2022 he attended A&E [REDACTED]. He reattended hospital on 28 March 2022 after a further incident of deliberate self-harm [REDACTED].

Christopher was admitted to the Langford Centre on 14 May 2022. His risk of suicide and self-harm was rated as high at the time of admission. The referral paperwork received by the Langford Centre made reference to the previous incidences of cutting and drinking of corrosive substances but did not mention ligatures. Christopher's care notes were not accessed by staff at the Langford Centre until after his death. There was no record of Christopher arriving at the Langford Centre with a belt, nor any record of a belt being within his possession nor taken from him at any stage. On the evening of 15 May 2022, Christopher was found unresponsive in his room [REDACTED] Paramedics were called and CPR was attempted, however, it was not possible to revive Christopher and death was confirmed at 23:01.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Initial referral – there seems to be a gap at the initial referral and admission stage in obtaining information about and recording previous methods of self-harm and suicide. There also appears to be a gap in the seeking and recording of relevant information from an individual's family at the point of referral and admission. An individual's family is often able to provide detailed and useful information about events that may not have been previously reported and/or be able to bridge the gap in communications between various health agencies involved in someone's care. Access to notes - the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessing of NHS notes. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individual's notes is not provided as standard. This means that there may be a significant gap in the information available when someone is admitted to a premises run by a private healthcare provider, even within an NHS allocated bed. This gap in information can have an impact on an individual's risk assessment and their subsequent care plan. 6"

Mr Gale had a long history of low mood and anxiety. He was engaging with mental health services and had been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Mr Gale was taking his medication but was still struggling to manage anxiety. Although Mr Gale denied suicidal intent, on the evidence and on the balance of probabilities, Mr Gale intended to take his life. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide","Mr Gale was detained under Section 2 Mental Health Act in November 2021 and was discharged from that section on 4 January 2022. Mr Gale was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Mr Gale was seen regularly by mental health professionals and was in frequent contact with mental health services. Those services were provided by Cumbria, Northumberland Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (“the Trust”). Mr Gale was compliant with his medication and engaged with services. He was well supported by his family and friends. Mr Gale's anxiety continued during his engagement with mental health services. Evidence was heard about what caused Mr Gale's anxiety. One ongoing feature was his application for Universal Credit. On 2 March 2023, 2 days before his death, Mr Gale was seen by an Associate Specialist Psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the inquest. The Psychiatrist considered Mr Gale's anxiety was exacerbated by his application for Universal Credit. During Mr Gale's appointment, the Psychiatrist called the benefits office for help but the call was not answered before the end of the consultation. Mr Gale was expecting a call from a DWP representative the next day (3 March). On 3 March 2022 at approximately 11:00 am, Mr Gale spoke to the duty Registered Mental Health Nurse. He remained very anxious and his main concern was the application for Universal Credit. During their evidence, the Associate Specialist Psychiatrist expressed concerns about the experience of mental health service users with DWP. These concerns were not just specific to Mr Gale. Evidence was also given by the Trust's Group Nurse Director (a Registered Mental Health Nurse) who considered that the issues identified by the Psychiatrist were national. The Director considered it important to address these issues as they were debilitating for service users. The Director advised that the Trust's Crisis Team had started a food bank 3 years ago to support service users. The Director was also aware that the DWP had been invited to the Cumbria Suicide Prevention Group. I stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Gale's death and his anxiety about his Universal Credit application. DWP was not an Interested Person in Mr Gale's inquest and did not give evidence as the concerns raised did not come to light until the hearing.",The evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms. I heard evidence that: 1. The number of and length of DWP forms required to be completed can be overwhelming for someone with a mental health illness. This is perpetuated if the applicant cannot get help to complete the paperwork. 2. There are long telephone queues to speak to a DWP advisor. 3. Having to travel long distances for appointments can be detrimental for those with a mental health illness. 6

When Michael was taken to St George's Hospital, he explained that he had been back and forth from the railway station, each He was discharged with a plan for follow up by the community mental health team (CMHT). I was told that the local CMHT meets at the beginning of every week, and then there is sometimes a delay before an appointment is made, so it was likely that Michael would have to wait an absolute minimum of a week to be seen. In the meantime, it was not thought necessary to refer him to the crisis team. Michael's family knew nothing of his mental ill health. He declined an invitation by the nurse assessing him to contact them. He did not want to worry them. Despite her awareness of the multiple therapeutic benefits of the input of a patient's loved ones, the assessing nurse did not in any way try to persuade Michael to allow her to do this. The first that Michael's family heard of Michael's mental ill health was when they heard of his death. I am sure that, had they been made aware of it while he was still alive, they would have done everything in their power to support him and to engage with the mental health services. Families very often complain to me at inquest that mental health services have not done enough to try to bring them in to a patient's care. In spite of the frequency of this occurrence, the lesson does not seem to be being learnt. When you respond to this letter, I should be grateful to know not just what you have done to address the issue in your own trust, but also what you have done to raise national awareness. 6"

The investigation concluded on the 29th September 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of suspension from a ligature whilst under the influence of alcohol. The medical cause of death was 1a) Hanging,Holly May Mullan had longstanding severe abdominal pain. She had long delays waiting for medical appointments to see gynaecologists and gastroenterologists due to long waiting lists. At times she accessed private consultations to try and obtain insight into and relief from her pain. On 7th May 2023 Holly May Mullan was found at 3 Napier Road attached to a ligature. Police enquiries found no suspicious circumstances and no evidence of third-party involvement. Post-mortem examination found she was significantly under the influence of alcohol at the time of her death.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The inquest heard evidence of the distress caused to Holly and the impact on her health by the long waits to be seen by gastroenterologists and gynaecologists within the NHS. The evidence heard was that post- Covid, the waiting times to be seen in both specialities unless the referral 1 was on the two-week cancer wait had grown significantly across England. As an illustration the inquest was told that pre-Covid, the average wait for a routine gynaecology referral was 18 weeks. Now in England the wait was often in excess of 12 months. Even an urgent referral would often involve a wait of over 40 weeks. This was leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment even in those with significant/severe health conditions. 6"

Chief Executive, Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, West Park Hospital, Edward Pease Way, Darlington, DL2 2TS 2. Care Quality Commission 1","On 25th of July 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Sarah Elizabeth Holmes, aged 32. The investigation has not yet concluded and the Inquest has not been heard, and is currently listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023.","The deceased had a history of mental health difficulties and self harm and was found dead after a discharge home, subsequent to a mental health assessment, [REDACTED] . The medical cause of death is [REDACTED] Asphyxia","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroner's service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 2022. The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 2023. On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased's family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be' likely end of July/August time'. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the 'end of September/beginning of October' and that the initial dates given were “too ambitious”. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased's family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author's sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due 'end of September/beginning of October'. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October. (2) The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again. (3) If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah's death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive. (4) I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of “serious incident” investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths. (5) I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trust's response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a result it is my statutory duty to make this further report. 2 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion – John George Condron took his own life whilst suffering extreme anxiety and stress in respect of allegations made against him which were being investigated by the police. This was exacerbated by i) him not having been informed that no further action was to be taken in respect of the most serious allegation against him, despite that decision having been made 10 days previously; and ii) no enquiries having been made in respect of evidence he referred to in his police interviews.","On the 2nd November 2017, John Condron was found at his home address suspended from the roof beams in his loft by a ligature around his neck made from a rope. At the time of his death he was under investigation by the Police, allegations having been made against him by his ex-partner but prior to these allegations being made, Mr Condron had reported to the police that he was the victim of domestic abuse by that same partner. Mr Condron had been interviewed by the police on three separate occasions in relation to two different allegations. On the 23rd October 2017 the decision was made to take no further action in relation to the most serious of those allegations. Mr Condron had not been informed of that decision which exacerbated the extreme anxiety and stress he was experiencing at the time of his death.","During the course of the inquest, evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:­ (1) I received evidence confirming the absence of any agreed protocol relating to Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 timescales for a suspect to be informed by the police of a decision to take no further action in respect of allegations made against them. At the conclusion of the Inquest, it was confirmed that this was the position both at the time of Mr Condron's death in November 2017 and at the conclusion of the Inquest in September 2023. (2) I received evidence that at a National Level, the Victim's Code of Practice provides that a victim has a right to be informed of key decisions in an investigation within 5 working days, or within 1 working day if they are eligible for Enhanced Rights. This includes a decision by the police to take no further action in respect of the allegations they have made. There is no such code of practice in respect of informing suspects of the same. (3) I have concerns that further self-inflicted deaths will occur in circumstances where a suspect is not informed, within a specified time period, of a decision to take no further action in respect of allegations made against them. 6"

The death of Manoel Messias Santos (“Mr Santos”) was reported to the coroner by HMP Belmarsh on the date of his death, 2 November 2020. . 2. A forensic post-mortem was conducted on 5 November 2020. The medical cause of death of MS was 1a: Hanging 3. On 24 February 2021 an Inquest was opened into the death of Mr Santos and an Article 2 Inquest was heard between 11 September 2023 and 25 September 2023 with a jury. The jury concluded with a narrative conclusion incorporating a conclusion of suicide. 4. I considered Prevention of Future Death (“PFD”) evidence (written and oral) on 27 September 2023.","1. Mr Santos was a Brazilian national who lived in the United Kingdom since 1997. He applied for indefinite leave to remain in 2004 but this was rejected in the same year. 2. He had a history of severe mental health issues. 3. Mr Santos was remanded to HMP Highdown on 29 October 2019, being transferred to HMP Belmarsh on 26 November 2019. On 6 May 2020, Mr Santos was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and was due to be released on 27 October 2020. 4. On 5 October 2020, the Immigration Service served an IS91 notice of a decision to detain on Mr Santos. This meant he would not be released from prison at the end of his sentence whilst his deportation was considered. A Stage 1 letter had been served on 28 December 2018 but a Stage 2 letter had not been served. There was also an outstanding appeal in the First-tier immigration Tribunal. 5. Mr Santos wrote a letter on a bail form outlining his concerns about returning to Brazil, referring to his sexuality and his health. This was sent by the prison to a charity assisting immigration detainees on 29 October 2020. 6. In the early hours of 2 November 2020, the night officer found Mr Santos hanging in his cell during a routine check. Staff tried to resuscitate him. Ambulance staff arrived. Mr Santos was declared dead at 3.30am. In summary, the jury found as follows: · That Mr Santos' understanding of his immigration position at the conclusion of his custodial sentence made a material contribution to his death. · There was a failure to notify Mr Santos of the incoming IS91 form and its significance. · The central issue was communication between Mr Santos and the various agencies involved with him. By 16 October 2020 Mr Santos understood he would be detained at the end of his sentence but was confident his bail application would lead to resolution. However in the days prior to his death he told a fellow prisoner he believed he was to be placed in immigration detention and deported within days. · Confusion amongst the agencies involved in communicating with Mr Santos is likely to have played a vital role in his change of understanding but it was difficult to pinpoint the role that information passed to Mr Santos played in changing his understanding of his position. There were no adequate notes of a meeting on 22 October 2020 with Mr Santos and his prison and community offender managers. However it was clear that his view of his circumstances changed and he decided to end his life and deliberately did not clearly communicate his intent to those around him.","During the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report. I have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, “The experience of immigration detainees in prisons,” dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest. Published responses to the report suggest some concerns are being addressed, albeit it is not clear if they have been resolved. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as “causative matters” in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases. Timing of IS91 notification. 2. The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (“FNOs”) by notification at this stage. Signposting legal advice about immigration matters 3. Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020. 4. I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted. 5. In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion. Communication between agencies 6. Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs. 7. I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of “prison offender managers” who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs. Delays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information. 8. I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos' case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos' case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report. 9. I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (“IPTs”). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information. The SSHD Internal report 10. The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos' case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed. 11. The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos' case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction. 12. This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been. Opening cell doors at night 13. In evidence there was a continued misunderstanding that the policy did not apply to Operational Support Grade (OSG) officers and it was understood that they should never open cell doors at night. This was despite the PPO report dated December 2021 (at paragraph 73) requesting this be addressed. 14. The prison stated in PFD evidence that all staff will be instructed as to the policy in terms of opening cell doors at night (which requires a dynamic risk assessment). 15. I remain concerned that this appears to be a longstanding belief held by experienced officers. 6"

National Police Chiefs' Council 3. NHS England 1,"An investigation was commenced into the death of Jack Peter Zarrop, aged 23. The investigation concluded on 29 September 2023. The conclusion of the jury in the inquest was: Suicide. We, the jury, find the: 1. Failure to remove the bedsheet and close the hatch allowing Jack to create a ligature point 2. Failure to refer to Liaison and Diversion services in Central and North-West London and the failure to open an ACCT whilst in prison custody, either of which would have triggered a more thorough risk assessment 3. The difficulties accessing relevant and important information relevant to J. Zarrop's history, both medical and custodial were the main contributing factors to the death of J. Zarrop. The medical cause of death was 1a Aspyhxia 1b Hanging","Jack had a history of difficulties with his mental health and a history of alcohol abuse. He had made multiple previous suicide attempts, including a very serious previous suicide attempt of hanging. He had previously been arrested in December 2020 and assessed by Liaison & Diversion services whilst in Police custody. After he was remanded in custody, he was placed on an ACCT twice in prison. After his release from prison on 14th February 2021, he was referred to the community Mental Health Crisis service by his GP and also had another very recent suicide attempt in the form of an overdose of anti- depressants about a week before he was again arrested on 17th March 2021. In Police custody, he was seen by a Custodial Nurse Practitioner (CNP) who had very limited training in Mental Health and the recognition of the risk of suicide. The CNP was working alone and not alongside a doctor. The CNP assessed Jack's risk as low. The CNP also did not refer him to Liaison & Diversion services, which the jury found that probably contributed to Jack's death. A Forensic Medical Examiner in Police custody subsequently assessed Jack's risk as high. Jack was again remanded in custody. Despite Jack's significant risk history as well as other significant risk factors, such as being young, withdrawing from alcohol and early days in custody, no ACCT was opened by prison or healthcare staff, who were overly reassured by Jack's presentation. An agency healthcare member of staff had no training in the ACCT process. The jury found that the failure to open an ACCT by prison and healthcare staff probably contributed to Jack's death and that, on the balance of probability, the risk of suicide was not adequately identified for Jack. These findings by the jury were based on the over-emphasis by prison and healthcare staff on Jack's presentation against clear and evidenced previous suicide and self-harm risks and attempts, which were available to relevant police, prison and healthcare staff. The Court heard evidence that 65% of primary care healthcare staff in prison are agency staff. The Home Office circular from 2003 relating to the use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners refers working alongside doctors and being specifically trained for their role. However, the Circular makes no mention of assessing the risk of suicide or self-harm in its Annex which lists competencies.","During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future. The 2003 Home Office circular also does not recognise the risk of suicide and self-harm as being a core competency. 2. The training of agency staff in the ACCT process and recognising the appropriate threshold to open an ACCT. The training of agency staff in ACCT does not appear to be part of the commissioning process by NHS England and individual providers do not appear to provide training to agency staff in the ACCT process. This places residents in prison at risk of death, given the high level of usage of agency healthcare staff in prison. 6"

He came under the care of the Home Based Mental Health Team (HBTT) following visiting the Humber Bridge with a wish to end his life on 7th May 2022. Mr Donoghue agreed to engage with HBTT and was awaiting an arranged handover to the Community Team. During this period, Mr Donoghue raised his concern at the lack of continuity of staff that were assigned to oversee his care plan. He specifically told HBTT that he would sometimes put on a front with new faces to make him look okay when he was struggling. The lack of continuity more than minimally hindered his ability to engage and receive the best level of care. On 24th May 2022,[REDACTED]. He was 33 years of age. His medical cause of death was recorded as: 1a Hanging","Mr Donoghue was an intelligent and high achieving individual who was part of a loving relationship. He had a history of anxiety but developed depression following the loss of his mother through suicide in January 2022, some childhood issues and frustrations over the care of his young poorly daughter. He had made previous attempts to end his life including using a ligature 4 years previously, an overdose on 28/02/2022, overdose attempts in April 2022. On 7th May 2022 Mr Donoghue was taken by police to Miranda House (a place of support for mental health) after he attended the Humber Bridge with the intention to end his life. Mr Donoghue indicated to staff at Miranda House that he wanted help; he was assessed, did not want admission and opted for being treated by the Home Based Treatment Team (HBTT). During May 2022 Scott spoke about hanging himself to his partner, [REDACTED]. The HBTT conducted a series of visits while he awaited a date to be moved to the Community Mental Health Team where he would have had one person having oversight of his care. Due to the need for 24 hour a day/7 days a week HBTT service, the court heard that continuity of care by either one person or a small group of people was not possible. Mr Donoghue raised concerns on more than one occasion about the lack of continuity of the people overseeing his care, he specifically told them that he could sometimes put on a front with new faces to make him look okay when he was actually struggling. Mr Donoghue used a ligature and hanged himself at his home on 24th May 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) It was evident that the lack of consistency in staff dealing with Mr Donoghue's care was a factor in his ability to engage and be honest with those having oversight of him at a very fragile time in his treatment. (2) Evidence was heard that the HBTT system is a nationwide treatment as 3 an alternative to hospital admission and although peoples' care in HBTT had improved, a real continuity of staff could only occur with a substantive change which would include additional funding, recruitment of appropriate staff and an ability to retain staff. I was informed that if these issues were addressed it would allow more capacity to manage consistency alongside the other demands of the service. (3) It is worthy of note that this is the 2nd inquest heard within 3 weeks in this jurisdiction whereby inconsistency of care staff has been cited as an issue in a suicide. The other inquest was the death of a 20 year old woman. (4) Mental Health is a rising problem and it is my understanding that 115 people die by suicide every week. Acknowledgement of the important work undertaken by HBTT and the need to give the very best support to those who have taken the, often difficult, step of seeking help with their care is a matter that requires imminent attention. 6"

At the inquest, which was a wider article 2 compliant inquest and lasted four days the court heard from several of those involved in Benjamin's short life, I concluded on 13 July 2023 with a narrative conclusion “Ben died as a consequence of his own actions during an episode of disturbed dissociative behaviour whilst waiting for a specialist bed to be procured in the community as a consequence of a failure to procure and provide a suitable inpatient bed to meet his needs.” 4","1. Ben Hazelden had a complex history including dyspraxia, autistic spectrum disorder, anxiety with depression and post traumatic stress disorder, the latter being due to having been abused earlier in his life. He suffered from dissociative episodes where he had at times harmed himself and others but otherwise was engaging and well-liked by those who met him. He was also in the process of seeing a neurologist given a family history of Huntingdon's disease. He was admitted to hospital as a 17 year old and transferred to adult services on reaching 18. A package was put in place for him to be transferred to the community with support from a private care provider with two members of staff being with him 24hours a day in March 2021. He initially did well and had also been seen by a psychologist from Kent and Medway Complex Autism service and was undergoing some therapy with a view to reducing his risk and stabilisation of his presentation prior to considering any long term trauma work. He had a deterioration in his mental health in July 2021 and was admitted under the provisions of the Mental Health Act to St. Martin's hospital in Canterbury. 2. He returned home in August and the dissociative incidents continued but were manageable until the end of the year when there were concerns over the increasing frequency and risks. In January 2022 he had taken himself onto train tracks near his house and was taken to the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital and assessed by liaison psychiatry who did not consider he had an acute treatable mental health problem. He stayed at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital whilst discussions ensued between the agencies involved in his care including Kent County Council, Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, Avondale, the Integrated care board and East Kent hospitals NHS Trust. Attempts were made to obtain a specialist bed and a Mental Health Act assessment on 28th January 2022 deemed him not to be detainable under the provisions of the Mental Health Act although the possibility of an informal bed was suggested as an interim solution. Ultimately it was decided that he should be discharged home with an increased package of care and now 3 carers. 3. He went home on 3rd February and on 11th February he assaulted two members of staff and ran to the nearby train station placing himself on the tracks where sadly a train coming into the station hit him. He died from his injuries at the scene. 5","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. In the course of hearing the evidence it was clear that young adults with autism who were at risk of self-harm as well as harm to others have very limited options in terms of placements where their needs can be met. A bespoke placement had been carefully created by those involved in Ben's care but this had taken several months to arrange. This arrangement had worked well and all involved tried to make it a success and for quite some time it was. It was however recognised that there may come a time in the future when his risks to himself and others would mean an alternative placement would be needed. 2. When Ben's risks to himself increased further there were no suitable beds available where he could be cared for in an environment which could meet his needs. He spent several days in an acute hospital bed despite being medically fit for discharge which although, essentially a place of safety, was totally unsuited to his needs. This stay continued whilst discussions ensued regarding where he should be placed. A bed in an acute psychiatric ward was considered but not deemed appropriate to meet his needs and as there were no specialist beds available he was discharged back to his home with increased support as the best option available. Had a bed been available in a specialist unit it is likely that he would not have died when he did. 3. In the evidence provided it became clear that a lot of units where a specialist bed may have been available had been closed in the past due to concerns about the level of care following a number of investigations. This has led to a system whereby locally and nationally there are limited options for those requiring care relating to both the management of autism and self-harm or harm to others, particularly when there is an urgent need for increased support. Whilst the inquest heard there were some counties who had specialist beds they were difficult to access as they were often full and places were not always available to meet urgent needs 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 17 -27 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide in addition the Jury answered a series of questions raised by me. In summary, the Jury concluded that Mr Stanley's death was probably caused or contributed to by a failure to follow the processes resulting in the staff best qualified to appreciate Stewart's risk to himself being excluded from the decision to remove him from constant watch. In the addition the Jury concluded that the multi-disciplinary processes in place were adequate however they were not fully complied with in this case.","On 23 June 2020 Mr Stanley was remanded in custody to HMP Exeter. On the night of 9 to 10 July, Mr Stanley's cellmate found him [REDACTED] seemingly trying to hang himself. He alerted prison staff, who started Prison Service suicide and self-harm prevention procedures (known as ACCT). The staff placed Mr Stanley under constant supervision and moved him to a special cell that allowed an officer to observe him continuously. On 11 July, after a case review it was decided that constant supervision should end and directed that Mr Stanley should now be observed at least once every half an hour during the evening. At around 1.20am on 12 July, the night patrol officer, found Mr Stanley hanging. She called for staff assistance and, when it arrived, they opened the cell, removed the ligature and began chest compressions. Paramedics arrived and took Mr Stanley to hospital, where he died on 14 July.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) The evidence revealed that there was an inconsistent approach taken by staff when conducting and recording observations on prisoners subject to the Prison Service suicide and self-harm prevention procedures (known as ACCT). (2) The evidence also revealed that some Officers had a different interpretation of the requirements of set out in PSI 64/2011 in respect of the timing of observations. (3) The evidence also revealed that precise times of such observations were not routinely being recorded accurately.

The Investigation undertaken by the Health Board was deficient in that it did not contain pertinent points relating to how the transfer of care did not occur. I have previously issued a number of Prevention of Future Death Reports relating to quality and timeliness of investigation. b. The Health Board's Transfer of Care document at the time the transfer occurred did not include any detail or process as to how the transfer should occur. The amended policy has still not been finalised and there remains a concern that deaths will continue to occur if the process is not finalised and shared widely within the Health Board to staff. c. Patient notes for mental health are still not electronic; they are paper based. I have issued several Prevention of Future Death Reports specifically relating to this. There has been considerable delay in actioning this and yet there is still not anticipated timescale for this to occur. As such, deaths will continue to occur or may occur into the future with the risk that notes are paper based only. The risk relates to only one department or individual having access to them at once when there is wider support for the patient. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 June 2023. I made a determination of death by suicide. The medical cause of death was: 1(a) Suspension by ligature","Mr Leger had been the subject of a Metropolitan Police investigation following a criminal allegation made in March 2022. He was arrested and interviewed under caution at the end of May 2022, following which he was bailed. That bail was converted to RUI (released under investigation) in August 2022. He attended voluntarily a further interview on 5 November 2022. On 23 January 2023, the CPS authorised that he be charged. This led to the generation of a PCR (Postal Charge Requisition) which was posted to him on 16 February 2023. This did not arrive at Mr Leger's address until after his death. However, Mr Leger learnt of the charge via his solicitor on the morning of 20 February 2023. Sometime between 7:30pm and 10:30pm on 20 February 2023, he took his own life. He had previously attempted to take his own life on 23 March 2022, after he had learnt of the allegation made against him. The investigating officer (OIC) was aware of this as Mr Leger had disclosed it when asked questions regarding his mental health and welfare at the times of the two interviews he attended. Although he had indicated at the times of the interviews that he had no concerns regarding his mental health/welfare, he also stated on 5 November 2022 that his mental health had suffered since the alleged incident. This was the last date that any assessment was made of his mental health. By the time that he was sent the PCR (charging him with an offence that carried a maximum life sentence), he had been “RUI'd” for almost 6 months and it was more than 3 months since there had last been any formal assessment by the police of his mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I received evidence, in particular from the investigating officer (OIC), who dealt with the investigation into the allegation against Mr Leger, and from an investigator from the Metropolitan Police's Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), who conducted an investigation on behalf of the IOPC into the way in which the criminal investigation was undertaken, in particular the consideration of Mr Leger's welfare and support offered to him. 3 I heard evidence: • That when a person who has been RUI'd is charged, standard practice (in accordance with current Metropolitan Police policies and procedures) is for that charge to be communicated to them via a PCR with no advance warning. • That this is the case regardless of the offence, or seriousness of the offence, with which they are being charged. • That in exceptional circumstances, where an individual is considered to be in a high-risk category, arrangements can be made for the PCR to be delivered in person and/or for a third party to be present to provide support. • That it is recognised that certain types of allegation, such as a sexual allegation (as was the case here), may carry a higher risk. This, of itself, does not place an individual into a high-risk category for the purposes of delivering the news that they are to be charged (by way of a PCR). • That whether an individual is, exceptionally, considered to be in a high-risk category (such as to cause a PCR to be delivered in person) is reliant on information about their mental health coming to the attention of the OIC. There is no formal requirement for the OIC proactively to seek this information. • That there is no formal process for assessing an individual's mental health and/or risk of suicide or self-harm at the time of delivery of a PCR. It is important to note the following: • At the point of charge, nothing has been proven against the individual concerned. They face an allegation, and are innocent if and until proven guilty to the criminal standard. • Many people are RUI'd. As such, PCR is now routinely used to bring most criminal charges. • Individuals who have been RUI'd can remain with this status for long periods of time (months or years) before a decision is made whether or not to charge them. • Whilst there are formal procedures to assess an individual's mental health and risk of self-harm or suicide when they attend a police station for interview, once they have left the police station there are no such formal procedures (as above), notwithstanding 4 the potential for a substantial period to elapse between the time they last attended a police station and the time that they are charged. • Being charged with any criminal offence, especially one which carries the potential for a custodial sentence, can, self-evidently, have a significant deleterious effect on an individual's mental health. It appears to me that, in the absence of a formal mechanism to assess, at the time of being charged, an individual's mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm, there is an obvious risk of individuals in the future taking their own lives as a result of being charged by way of a PCR (potentially following a lengthy period of having been RUI'd and potentially months or years since there was last any consideration by the police of their mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm). In Mr Leger's case, the relevant policies and procedures were those of the Metropolitan Police. However, these issues clearly arise at a wider (national) level and, as head of the College of Policing, you have overall responsibility for policies/guidance disseminated at a national level. 6"

Allison was 12 years old when she passed away on the 19th July 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 17th August 2023. The conclusion was that Allison died as a result of suicide, contributed to by neglect.","Allison Aules was referred to the mental health team in May 2021 with concerns around evidence of self-harm, low mood, anxiety and enuresis. Her case was inappropriately screened as routine and the referral was triaged 8 weeks later. Allison was not communicated with at this time, but her mother shared a full account of concerns with the triage psychologist. Additional concerns were raised during triage and the matter was taken to a multi-disciplinary team. The team decided that Allison should be assessed face to face. They determined the case to be low risk and placed it in the green zone. The concerns shared with the service should have resulted in a more urgent face to face assessment. The assessment of Allison took place 9 months later. This was not a face-to-face assessment, as directed by the multi-disciplinary team. There was a telephone discussion, initially with Allison's mother alone. Allison later spoke to the assessor but there was no full assessment of her mental state. There was no full exploration of the concerns raised in the referral and in the triage discussion. There was no evidence of the assessor determining the cause of Allison's worrying presentation. There was no carefully documented assessment of risk. There was no carefully devised risk management plan. A decision was made to discharge Allison from the mental health team, with no multi-disciplinary review or liaison with the referrer. Allison continued to receive counselling provided at her school, but this concluded at the end of term, on the 15 July 2022. On the 18 July 2022 Allison was found suspended in her bedroom. The failure to provide basic mental health care to Allison contributed to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced. The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern. The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country. There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams. The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor. The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10 – 12 per week. The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week. There is a concern that ongoing under resourcing of CAMHS services (whilst demand continues to increase), will result in future similar deaths. 6"

In the circumstances I am concerned that the line may be readily accessible to individuals who wish to harm themselves. 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide Cause of death - 1a Respiratory depression 1b overdose, 1c II","Took her own life by an overdose of prescribed medication at home and died in Hillingdon Hospital on 12 August 2022. At the time she was in poor physical health and experiencing considerable anxiety as she was trying, with assistance from the Council, to clear her home of numerous hoarded possessions. She spoke with the single point of access (SPA) crisis telephone service during the evening of 10th August to ask for help, but no mental health assessment was performed and she was not called back by the team as promised. Her neighbour requested a welfare check be performed the next day when she was found collapsed and taken to hospital.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Mrs Smith was recognised to be a hoarder and her council property was dangerously full of items blocking all access, impeding stair access and impacting on her ability to access the kitchen or bathroom. The gas supply had been cut off as she did not allow access for the annual inspection. Mrs Smith recognised she had a problem and asked the council for assistance. The offered solution only moved some of her belongings into a local ""void"" property that she did not have access to with no plan for how to resolve this temporary situation, creating considerable anxiety and stress for Mrs Smith who then took her own life by overdosing with her prescribed medication (1) The inquest identified that there was insufficient staff training to deal with complex hoarder cases. (2) Other safety assessments such as a fire assessment and/or environmental health assessment were not requested despite their being a clear need. (3) The council ""flow chart"" was clearly not fit for purpose to assist staff in progressing hoarder support and assistance and was focussed on enforcement procedures rather than tenant support. The inquest was advised that the council's approach was not enforcement, but their documentation did not support this. (4) It was entirely unclear what options were available (if any) when the first plan of assistance completely failed, leaving the vulnerable tenant excluded from her property with no forward plan. 6 7 8"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 July 2023. The jury recorded a narrative conclusion which stated: Haik was a vulnerable person with Autism Spectrum Disorder, who committed suicide following failures by those organisations who had responsibility to protect him from harm. He had a documented history of mental health difficulties, self-harm, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. The decision to withdraw prescription medications managing his depression without a documented risk assessment or enhanced monitoring was not in his best interest and led to him experiencing psychological withdrawal symptoms, exacerbating his anxiety and depression. The insufficient security at the prison allowed illegal drugs to circulate which contributed to his bullying and exploitation and created a barrier to accessing prescription medication. The prolific bullying, exploitation and humiliation that Haik experienced in prison contributed to his declining mental health. Policies, procedures and interventions put in place to safeguard him were ineffective, ill-advised and at times absent. This resulted in ineffective communication, between the Prison, Health and Mental Health services which meant information was recorded but inconsistently shared and acted upon effectively. Furthermore, the absence of a process for escalating concerns put him at heightened risk. Due consideration for the complexities that Austism Spectrum Disorder can present were not appropriately addressed. Due to a lack of adequate training and the absence of a clinical psychologist, some of his behaviours were interpreted to be dangerous rather than the presentation of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This resulted in the interventions that were in place being ineffective, and incompatible with Haik's needs and therefore this was an unsuitable custodial environment for him.",Haik committed suicide [REDACTED] and was found unresponsive in his cell in the early hours of 11th March 2019 at HMYOI Aylesbury (as it then was).,"Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) HMP Aylesbury transitioned from a High Security Young Offenders Institution (a role it had undertaken for many years) into a Category C Training Prison after the time in which Haik Nikolyan had been an inmate. This has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs. Staffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time. Healthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today. Following the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward. I was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward. Some three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers. Although initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work. The evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution. The indication in evidence was that addressing these issues and continuing to address these issues is a matter for His Majesty's Prisons and Probation Service, working with HMP Aylesbury. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which took place on 13 and 14 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide The cause of death was established as: I a Hanging (suspension by ligature),"Miss Zarins was a 42 year old female who was reported missing by her family and discovered suspended [REDCATED], Leicestershire. Her death was confirmed at the scene by one of the attending paramedics on 24 November 2021 at 16:04hours.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Pre-amble The inquest heard evidence that Miss Zarins had suffered with depression since 2008. She managed this by taking anti-depressant medication intermittently, she stopped taking her anti-depressants in June/July 2021. Miss Zarins came under the care of Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (“LPT”) on 22 November 2021, after taking an intentional overdose the day before. Miss Zarins was initially under the care of LPT's Mental Health Liaison team but was transferred to the care of LPT's CRISIS Team when she returned to her home address on 22 November 2021. Miss Zarins expressed a desire to work with the CRISIS team and to recommence anti-depressants as soon as possible in order to improve her mental health. On 23 November 2021 Miss Zarins was discussed at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (“MDT”) meeting at LPT. The discussions at that meeting were fundamentally flawed, as was the plan for Miss Zarins' care moving forward that was formed at that meeting and then implemented. The meeting proceeded on the basis that Miss Zarins was on, and had been on, anti-depressant medication at the time of taking the overdose, this was incorrect. The second and final MDT meeting where Miss Zarins was discussed (on 24 November 2021) also proceeded on this same mistaken basis. Despite Miss Zarins verbalising both her desire to get more sleep and her desire to go back onto anti-depressants as soon as possible, neither sleeping tablets nor anti-depressants were prescribed to her by LPT before she died. LPT continued to advise Miss Zarins that she would have to wait until 30 November 2021 to have a medical review. A member of LPT staff who was present at both MDT meetings informed the inquest that he did not have time to read the notes of the patients that were to be discussed at the MDT meetings. The staff member had not read Miss Zarins' core assessment documentation (which correctly stated she was not on any anti-depressants) before either MDT meeting. Evidence heard at inquest was that Miss Zarins should have been put back onto anti­ depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets on 23 November 2021. LPT undertook a Serious Incident Investigation into the care provided to Miss Zarins before her death. The investigation was wholly inadequate. Issues include, but are not limited to: 1. There was no medical input into the investigation; 2. The investigation failed to explore appropriately the functionality of the MDT meetings; Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 3. The investigation failed to identify the error in understanding of the Miss Zarins' medication position; 4. Due to the fact that the investigation failed to identify the error relating to the understanding of the medication position, the investigation also failed to identify the fact that the treatment plan that was implemented was flawed. The investigation failed to identify the fact that Miss Zarins should have been recommenced on anti­ depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets before her death. Notwithstanding the inadequacy of the Serious Incident report the document accepts that, whilst the anti-depressants would not have had an immediate impact on Miss Zarins' mood, the thought of having to wait a week for this medication may have added to her sense of hopelessness. This was echoed by witnesses at the inquest. I also accept, on the balance of probabilities, and when considered alongside Miss Zarins' clear desire to recommence her anti-depressants in order to get better, that the fact she was told she had to wait a week for a medical review would have added to her sense of hopelessness. Concerns 1) I am concerned about the CRISIS team MDT meetings and their functionality. It is difficult to understand how a meeting attended by around 7 people agreed a treatment plan which was based upon incorrect information relating to the patient's medication status. This is particularly difficult to understand when the correct medication status is clearly documented in the patient's core assessment paperwork (which was completed by the Liaison Team on 22 November 2021 and sent to the CRISIS Team). An LPT staff member was candid about the fact that he did not have enough time to review patients' records before the MDT meetings, this is a grave concern. 2) I remain concerned about both the standard of documentation and lack of documentation relating to the discussion of Miss Zarins at the two MDT meetings. The Trust were only able to provide me with documentation relating to one of the two MDT meetings. That documentation is incorrectly completed and lacks detail. In particular, there is no detail about medication despite there being a specific box within which to document this. This problem of poor and/or missing documentation is not a risk that is limited to the CRISIS Team, it is one that could have ramifications not only across the Trust but across all of the bodies who come together to provide care for patients. 3) I remain gravely concerned about the inadequacies in the Serious Incident Investigation and Reporting processes at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust. The Serious Incident Investigation failed to identify the errors in the care provided to Miss Zarins making the use of the process somewhat otiose in this case. The failure to properly investigate led to the wholly untenable situation where errors in care were uncovered for the first time at inquest, which took place some 20 months after the date of death (due to witness availability). I am concerned that the lack of robust critical analysis and investigation of the care Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 provided to Miss Zarins before her death has caused a delay to, and led to missed opportunities (for some staff) to learn lessons that are vital to patient safety. My concerns relating to the inadequacy of the Trust Serious Incident Investigations and the risks related to that go far beyond just the care provided by the CRISIS Team. The risks have the ability to prevent learning, therefore negatively impact upon patient safety, across the entire Trust. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 April 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that: on 3 June 2019, Leah Barber was found deceased at the Bolton Woods Quarry, Bolton Hall Road in Bradford. Leah was suffering a range of mental health pressures in the last 18 months of her life, and her mental health fluctuated in the terms of the nature and severity of those pressures. She had previous thoughts of taking her own life and had tried to do so on two occasions. [REDACTED] On the morning of 3 June 2019 Leah left a note at her home address for family which indicated an intent to take her own life. From the location within the quarry at which she was discovered and a post-mortem examination it was apparent that Leah had fallen from a height of around 30 metres. The evidence showed that Leah had taken her own life. The medical cause of death was: 1a. Multiple injuries with inhalation of water 1b. Fall from a height",As per box 3 (immediately above).,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) A detailed review of the evidence in this case, which included evidence from two Schools ( ), as well as from Bradford Children's Social Services, the TRACKS Education team (at Bradford Council), the SCIL Team and the Council's SEND Team, revealed that no one person or department at Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Bradford Council had an overview of Council's involvement in relation to Leah (prior to her death). Of greater concern was that that remained so after each of the Council departments involved were notified that Leah had passed away. Every organisation which had contact with the Coroner's service in relation to Leah's death, with the exception of Bradford Council, was able to provide the Court with an overview/analysis of their involvement with Leah prior to her death and (where appropriate) the lessons they had learnt as a result their involvement with Leah. The Police and the local Mental Health Trust were examples of two public bodies who had and were able to provide an overview/analysis to the Court in terms of their involvement with Leah and confirm whether there were any lessons to be learned by them. The evidence provided by witnesses from the various Bradford Council teams which were involved with Leah, showed a clear disconnect in the involvement of the various Council departments. That was not caused by those individuals who had provided written statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide oral evidence. Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actions/omissions on the part of individuals/teams within the Council which more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Leah's death, the concern is that Bradford Council appeared not to have a system/process in place which allowed anyone (whether an individual / a team) within the Council to have an overview of deaths where there had been previous Council involvement with the deceased (in this case a child). In the apparent absence of such oversight Bradford Council would not be able to learn lessons from such cases (or even know if there were lessons to be learned). The absence of such a single point of oversight as was apparent in Leah's case, contributes to the risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 09 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that the Deceased impulsively took her own life (by hanging) whilst suffering increased emotional dysregulation against a background of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.,"The Deceased was found in a lifeless state in the garage at her family home at approximately 09.15 on the morning of 25 June 2022 by her partner, who had last seen her alive when the couple went to bed at approximately midnight on the evening of 24 June 2022. She was found suspended [REDACTED]. The evidence indicted that she had secured the ligature herself before lowering herself into it. The evidence established that she had died at some point in the early hours of the morning – it was known that she was not sleeping. There were no suspicious circumstances concerning the death. The Deceased was diagnosed with EUPD and ADHD and was receiving therapy and support from the community mental health team and from her GP in respect of physical pain. She had been struggling in the months prior to her death with emotional dysregulation, reflective of her EUPD but influenced in part by a programme of gradual reduction in her medications, which she had requested. The evidence was not able to establish that the change in her medication had chemically caused an instability in her emotions (and it was recognised that both the long term and concomitant use of her various prescription medications were clinically indicated and without contra-indications). However, the psychological impact of reduction, coupled with increasing social stressors and an increasingly subjective feeling of isolation, abandonment and lack of being heard in the last few weeks of her life are believed to have all contributed to an increasing internal narrative which led, on the evening of 24 June 2022, and without warning, to a spontaneous and impulsive act against an increasing background of emotional dysregulation. There was no evidence to indicate that her death had been an accident or a cry of help (given the timing and nature of the act). In the context of her complex diagnosed conditions however, the risk of dangerous and impulsive acts with impulsive intent was recognised, but not in all the circumstances expected.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. It was recognised in evidence and in submission to the Court by representatives of the Trust, that there is and remains a fragmented relationship between mental health and physical health services, with little inter-service connectivity. It was recognised that ideally services for those with both mental and physical health diagnoses should be connecting in a seamless, timely and collaborative manner - specifically through the joint commissioning of services, to support patients of all ages. Nationally it is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in this death), impacts on both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst local initiatives have been explored by SHFT and by the ICB - Project Fusion I understand is such an example - much of the development of such services falls outside of scope and commissioning. Consequently, there is a significant and pressing need for connectivity between mental health services and those services supporting neurodivergent patients. It was noted in evidence e.g. that SHFT do not currently have a comorbidity policy that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental health condition and a learning difficulty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other NHS organisations within the Southampton (or in fact the wider Hampshire) area - save for private clinics, which many cannot afford. The facts in this case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity between services is still too little and too slow. More needs to be done, and with greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to be sufficiently and appropriately met in the future and similar deaths prevented. 2. Evidence before this inquest indicated that SHFT has recognised that the mental health provision for those with personality disorders must move towards an individual, therapeutic and trauma-informed approached, which is both compassionate and recovery focused. It is evident that the 'Personality Disorder Pathway' currently being developed is an important step towards that, enabling practitioners and services to take a more holistic and person-centred approach, reducing risk and improving outcomes. I am aware that SHFT have been encouraged to review and further develop the Pathway. I am concerned that that must occur, and at pace. 3. I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being suffiently, effectively and meaningfuly listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatement or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions. There remains an over-focus on patient centric assessments and patient only responses. It is recognised that patients can present quite differently to and in the presence of their families, who know them intimately, to how they may (or may be able to) present to assessing clinicians - with or without the intent to mask their condition. Whilst consent to share is an understandable barrier in some cases, there should not be a bar to listening to or to actively encouraging feedback and input from families, especially where a family's concerns are heightened by any sudden or marked changes in the behaviours, mood or presentation of their relative outside of the clinical/assessment environment - particularly in the case of neurodiversity. Unless all concerns are heard and considered and all availble information is taken on board, holistically, there is a continuing risk that the masking of mental health conditions and the deterioration of them may occur or that significant red flags are missed. In this case, the family's increasingly desperate concerns voiced about their daughter's evident mental health deterioration in her final days went un-responded. 4. Finally, I am concerned that more needs to be done to inform and assist families, particularly in cases of patients with neurodiversity. In this particular case, the evidence found, for example, that the family were never briefed on what EUPD and ADHD really meant or on the difficulties which could present as a result of their daughter's joint diagnoses. Being unaware as to what they were to expect, they were consequetnly often at a loss to know how to interact with or to help her. Neither they nor their daughter received advice on possible medication withdrawal symptoms. 6"

Chief Executive Officer of Essex Partnership NHS Trust, Paul Scott, Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, The Lodge, Lodge Approach, Runwe/1, Wickford, SS11 7XX","On 15th June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Johanne Blackwood, aged 55 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 11th May 2023. Johanne Blackwood (known as Jo) died on the 12th of June 2021 when she placed herself in the path of a train [REDACTED] The medical cause of death was confirmed as '1a Multiple traumatic injuries', 1b 'Collision with train (locomotive). In a narrative conclusion I recorded that the deceased took her own life on a background of diagnoses of severe and long-standing mental health disorders including Persistent Delusional Disorder, Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder and Panic Disorder. I concluded, inter alia, that an inappropriate over­ reliance upon family members to keep a vulnerable and high-risk person safe in the community, over an extended period, probably contributed to Jo taking her own life.","A central aspect of Jo's delusional beliefs was that (a) she had not slept for years and (b) that she suffered from a fatal physical health condition. The desperation engendered by her delusional and medically entirely unfounded beliefs led to a number of suicide attempts and both voluntary and compulsory admissions to mental health units. On the pt May 2021 Jo had attempted suicide [REDACTED] , some five weeks later, she would end her life. In the light of this incident her community risk assessment, her care plan and her safety plan were not up-dated – as they had not been since the date of her last discharge as a mental health in-patient on the 18 th December 2020. Whilst her high risk of suicide was acknowledged by the community mental health team responsible for her safety – and care, management and treatment – in the community, and notwithstanding the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, I found an inappropriate over-reliance upon her family members, principally her husband and son, to keep Jo safe in the community. This involved the family monitoring Jo 24 hours a day, seven days a week over an extended period and physically preventing her from leaving her home address unaccompanied . This over-reliance was misguided and placed an unfair and unsustainable burden on the family, particularly in the light of a highly concerning text message sent by Jo to her Care Coordinator threatening suicide on the 11th June, the day before she took her own life. Following receipt of the text and seemingly reassured in part by Jo's apparent retraction of the threat later that day, there was a failure to undertake an urgent face to face assessment by the community team to establish whether a referral to the Crisis Team was necessary; this specific failure possibly contributed to the subsequent death. In the circumstances I concluded that an inappropriate over-reliance upon family members to keep such a vulnerable and high-risk person safe in the community, over an extended period of time, probably contributed to Jo taking her own life on the 12th June 2021.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. Although not identified as causative of the death in this case, in my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ­ 1. Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to when, where and by (or between) whom any formal handover of responsibility as Care Coordinator (CC) for Jo took place as between a number of CCs allocated to Jo over a period of many months from the lead up to and following her discharge as an in-patient back to the community team on December 18th 2020 and through to early May 2021. 2. Consequently , the evidence confirmed, despite her clear vulnerabilities, Jo did not have an allocated Care Coordinator for several weeks up to the beginning of May 2021. The evidence also confirmed that the lack of clarity as to the timing and conduct of CC handovers and the absence of an allocated CC to work with Jo (and by extension, her family) was informed by lack of a formal policy or procedure requiring that a full, detailed, formal record of handover between Care Coordinators is to be placed on EPUT electronic records. 3. Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians/staff, has the responsibility for oversight of patient care 2 6 7 8 9 following discharge, including responsibility for ensuring adequate and appropriate safety-netting is in place in the event ofrelapse, where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place/has not been replaced. Please note that this 3rd concern was previously raised by me with CEO of EPUT (and in very similar terms) in a PFDR dated 25.02.2022 following the death of Stephanie Moyce. 4. The community Risk Assessment, Care Plan and Security Plan for Jo were not updated by a Care Coordinator between December 2020 and Jo's death."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 July 2023.,"Peter had a long history of depression, anxiety, and reported suicide attempts. He had acknowledged his reluctance to always engage fully with the treatment offered. On 3/08/22 he was referred to the home treatment team for crisis intervention. After poor engagement he was transferred back to the community mental health team. On 14/10 he was detained by police under section 136 mental health act after expressing suicidal ideation. He told a psychiatric liaison service nurse he had no ongoing suicidal ideation and was referred to the community mental health team and his GP. He contacted the crisis team on 30/10. He was telephoned by a mental health nurse on 31/10, and Peter reported upset about personal issues but no suicidal ideation. On 31/10 he also contacted RELATE and had a telephone consultation with his GP, reporting worsening mental health in part because of a delay in his medication being prescribed, but reported no suicidal ideation. On 8/11 he called the crisis team reporting upset but no suicidal ideation. This prompted a community mental health team nurse on the 9/11 to try without success contacting Peter on the telephone. On 10/11/22 Peter was found deceased in his flat having taken a deliberate overdose of his prescribed medication. At the time of his death he was on the waiting list to be allocated a mental health care co-ordinator and there had been no multi-disciplinary meeting with all teams involved to agree how best to work with Peter. His cause of death was confirmed at post-mortem: 1a Carbamazepine toxicity. The conclusion reached was death was a consequence of suicide.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. There continues to be a chronic lack of resources to treat seriously mentally ill patients in Birmingham and Solihull. In the summer of 2022 Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust ('BSMHFT') wanted to admit the deceased to an inpatient psychiatric unit, however, no bed was available, and he remained in the community. Shortly before his death, the deceased had been detained by the police under section 136 of the mental health act. There was no available 'place of safety' and he had to be taken to an emergency department. The police, BSMHFT, and hospital Drs agreed the deceased needed to be assessed under the mental health act, however Birmingham City Council could not provide an approved mental health practitioner ('AMPH') to attend in a 24-hour period. When the section 136 lapsed the deceased was discharged home after a review by a mental health nurse. At the time of his death the deceased was on BSMHFT's waiting list for a care- coordinator. The lack of care-coordinators, mental health inpatient beds, 'place of safety', and AMHPs, presents a risk seriously mentally ill people are not receiving necessary treatment. The evidence is that these issues are a consequence of a chronic lack of resources at a local and national level. The Birmingham and Solihull coroners have been repeating identical concerns in Prevention of Future Death Reports for many years. 2. BSMHFT utilizes self-contained specialist teams. The deceased was treated by (a) crisis team/home treatment team, (b) community mental health team, and (b) psychiatric liaison team. The evidence demonstrated communication between the specialist teams was not effective and this caused delays. For example, the psychiatric liaison team nurse that reviewed the deceased updated the community mental health team. However, the GP could not prescribe the deceased's medication in October 2022 because it had not been approved by the community mental health team consultant via an ESCA and the deceased went without his medication. The deceased's GP had to contact the community mental health team directly notwithstanding the psychiatric liaison nurse's involvement. The deceased cited this delay as making his mental health worse shortly before his death. My concern is communication between the specialist teams is not effective enough. BSMHFT's RCA action plan is to seek assurance from the CCG/ICB that communication between the specialist teams is being strengthened. My concern is that this does not go far enough and there should be consideration of a formal process or policy. 3. Carbamazepine management was proposed in 2012 to manage the deceased's mental health however this was not picked up by his GP and was only noted by a BSMHFT consultant in August 2022. Therefore, the deceased went 10 years without this medication. BSMHFT could not explain at the inquest why this omission had not been identified sooner. BSMHFT's RCA action plan does not have any action to avoid a repeat occurrence. My concern is this issue indicates a problem with process and systems and further consideration is required to avoid a repeat occurrence. 4. The deceased's GP raised concerns that different health organisations use different digital systems that do not communicate with each other. Further, GPs often do not get important patient updates from primary care organisations for many days or weeks. (See examples above: the GP did not pick up the carbamazepine prescription, and could not prescribe the medication in October 2022). My concern is communication between different health organisations is not as effective as it could be and important information is being missed, and consequently a material delay in treatment is occurring. 5. The deceased's GP raised concerns that current resources do not allow GPs to pro- actively check patients are collecting prescribed medication due to excessive patient lists. My concern is that this is a consequence of lack of resources at a national level. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you."

Hon. Lucy Frazer KC, MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport 1","On 06 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Luke Anthony Ashton aged 40. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion: Luke Ashton died as a result of his own actions, intending those actions to cause his death. At the time of his death, Luke was suffering from a gambling disorder, which was longstanding, at least from 2019 and which contributed to his decision to take his own life. In the months prior to his death, the evidence showed that Luke had been assessed as a low-risk gambler by the operator with whom he was gambling, although Luke's gambling activity, deposits made and losses suffered were most intensive in the 10 weeks prior to his death. The same operator did not intervene or interact with Luke, in any meaningful way, between 2019 and the date of Luke's death, when more efforts to intervene or interact should have been made. Opportunities were missed which may possibly have changed the outcome for Luke. The cause of death was established as: I a ([REDACTED]) I b Gambling Disorder","Luke Ashton was a 40-year-old man who was discovered deceased by attending police officers and paramedics at Carnegie House, Swinton, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire on 22 April 2021, [REDACTED]. His death was confirmed at the scene by one of the attending paramedics.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Preamble During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashton's gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 2019. The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time. During the 'relevant period' examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashton's death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as 'player protection tools', as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him. Concerns 1) I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler. 2) I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally. 3) I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 become problem gamblers. 6"

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death:

Suicide","Matters of Concern

1. The generic, tick-box style of history recording by CATT which does not paint a full and proper picture of the mental health of the patient, especially compared to the assessments of psychiatric liaison, are such that risk may be unrecorded and under appreciated by CATT and patients thus be put at risk.

2. That the role of CATT to look for alternatives to admission may risk CATT discharging patients who would benefit from admission and risk the repeat of making treatment plans that had recently failed such as in this case. Rather than looking for admission alternatives being a core function, should CATT rather better be focussed on the best treatment plan for the individual patient and thus admission being viewed as a clear option where appropriate rather a last resort, as it often appears to be presented in such cases before the coroner?

3. That the provision of care-coordinators be increased and improved so that patients who require them have ready access at the time of need and are not placed on a waiting list.

4. That patients to be discharged by CATT, as well as patients to be admitted are discussed with the on-call psychiatrist so that plans may be reviewed, and thus the risk of not admitting patients who would benefit from and/ or require admission such as Mr Khala, are less likely to be discharged inappropriately.

5. That where psychiatric teams differ in their assessments such as CATT and psychiatric liaison, as occurred here, patients are not discharged until opinion is sort from the on-call consultant and re-discussion taken place between those with differing views.

6. That expertise covering neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD is available as part of MINT."

MINISTER OF STATE FOR PRISONS AND PROBATION 1,"On 13th June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Liam Ryan Wayne Bentley. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29th June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Liam Bentley took his own life ([REDACTED]) but his intention in doing so was unclear. The failure to provide adequate physiological support through SOS and/or a psychologist possibly contributed to the death. Other issues which were deemed to be relevant to the circumstances of the death but could not possibly contribute to the death were as follows. 1. Failure to open an ACCT on or after 16th April. 2. Failure to instigate a care plan 3. Inadequate response to missed medication from 16th April onwards. 4. The Management of the self seclusion plan was inadequate, and failures to implement agreed actions from CSIP and SIM meetings. 5. Ineffective communication between the prison and the health care provider. 6. Staff shortages and gaps in training.","Liam Bentley was transferred to HMP Swaleside on 25th March 2022. He was a serving prisoner with a sentence expiry in 2024. He had ADHD and ASD for which he was medicated with mirtazapine administered by healthcare and at the time of his death atomoxetine, held in possession. He had 19 previous ACCTs for self harm and an attempt at suspension whilst serving his sentence at other establishments. Following his transfer he informed prison staff that he was in fear of other prisoners and wanted a move to another wing. He caused a superficial cut to his hand and said that he wanted to kill himself before anyone else did. An ACCT was not opened, the evidence being that officers after further speaking to him did not regard this as a self harm issue, the focus being to engineer a wing move. He was moved to a different wing but continued to express concerns about prisoners on the new wing. A self seclusion document was opened, a local policy closely aligned to the ACCT process aimed at reintegrating the prisoner to the regime was started but was not managed in accordance with the policy with assessments and reviews being done weeks after they should have been and no management plan were not put in place. Required daily interactions were sometimes done, sometimes not, referrals to psychology and SOS were either not made having been identified as necessary through the self seclusion, CSIP and SIM processes or made and not actioned","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27/6/2023. The conclusion of the inquest was recorded as: Suicide The medical cause of death was: la. Suspension by ligature lb. Unstable Affective Disorder.","Kaye McCoy suffered from depression and anxiety and was diagnosed with Unstable Affective disorder. Kaye had been under the care of the Older Adults Mental Health Team since 2017 and prior to that under the care of the Adult Psychiatric Services. On 1/9/2022, Kaye had an outpatient appointment with her consultant psychiatrist who advised admission to hospital, but Kaye declined. On 5/9/2022, Kaye took an overdose of prescribed medication with an intention to end her life, she was assessed in hospital and discharged back to the care of her care co-ordinator. Kaye was followed up daily by her care coordinator who, on Friday 9/9/2022, again offered Kaye admission to hospital. At the inquest I determined that by this stage Kaye was in crisis and her main protective factor, which were her family, had been diluted. Kaye was expressing anger towards and was emotionally distanced from family members. The inquest found that there was no strategy developed for the involvement of Kaye's family in her care, and that engagement with the family by the mental health teams had been poor. After seeing Kaye on 9/9/2022, the next follow up was scheduled for the Monday after the weekend; 12/9/22.

Kaye was told that if her condition deteriorated she should phone the Samaritans. Kaye McCoy [REDACTED] taken her own life by hanging on Sunday 11/9/2022. I determined that her death was contributed to by a failure of the mental health service to adequately respond to a severe downturn in Kaye's mental health.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: - At the inquest I was referred to the National Confidential Enquiry into Suicides. I was informed that the Enquiry identified key factors that should be adopted by Health Organisations to reduce the incidence of suicides, including: • That there should be a strategy for engagement with the family. • That every patient should have access to 24-hour Crisis Support Neither of these key components of care were available to Kaye.

The investigation was concluded at the end of the Inquest on 2nd June 2023. The conclusion given was a narrative conclusion namely: Rachel, who was suffering from a complex mental health disorder, took her own life having suffered a deterioration of her mental health in the preceding months. Despite the extensive support of her family and the care being provided by the Mental Health services they had been unable to keep her safe. There was a missed opportunity to prevent her from leaving the Royal Sussex County Hospital on the second occasion on the 29th July 2020.","Rachel had been struggling with her mental health for some time, but there had been a marked deterioration in July 2020. She had, on a number of occasions, been found close to the cliff edge in and around Brighton. On each occasion she was either detained by the Police under Section 136 Mental Health Act 1983 or voluntarily agreed to attend A&E at the Royal County Sussex Hospital. On 28th July 2020 Rachel had again been found on the cliff edge. She was detained under Section 136 Mental Health Act and was again taken to A&E in Brighton. Before a mental health assessment could be carried out, she absconded from the hospital and returned home. In the early hours of the 29th July her parents contacted the ambulance service as they felt unable to keep Rachel safe. She was returned to A&E where she was later seen by the Mental Health Liaison team. Throughout her time in A&E she was nursed by an HCA on a 1 to 1 basis. Although Rachel was found not to be detainable under the Mental Health Act the Consultant Psychiatrist, who was part of the Mental Health Liaison Team, had recommended that if she decided to leave the Hospital again, that consideration should be given to the use of the Doctor's holding power under Section 5(2) Mental Health Act. Sadly, Rachel did leave the hospital for a second time and went back to the cliffs where she ended her life by falling from the cliff top.","During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- Patients who attend a Hospital Accident and Emergency Department with mental health difficulties are in most hospitals seen by a Mental Health Liaison team (made up of Consultant Psychiatrists and Mental Health nurses) These staff are not employed by the Acute Hospital Trust but are employed by a local Mental Health Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust). As a result of their employment status the Mental Health Liaison team (who have the best knowledge of the patient having been caring for them) cannot invoke the Doctors or Nurses holding powers under Section 5(2) Mental Health Act (Section 5(4) for nurses). If a patient decides to abscond from the Acute Trust Hospital the Mental Health staff cannot detain/hold the patient. They would have to ask a Doctor within the Acute Hospital to do so. This Doctor may not have any knowledge of the patient and would be unlikely to act immediately in a busy A&E. By that time the patient would have been long gone. Due to this technical issue around the employment status of the Mental Health Team, those suffering with a deteriorating mental health in an acute setting are at risk in these circumstances. 6"

An inquest into the death of Mr Wright was opened on 5 July 2022. The inquest resumed on 22 May 2023 and concluded on 6 June 2023.

The medical cause of Mr Wright's death was:

1a. Quetiapine Toxicity

The inquest concluded with a narrative conclusion as follows:

'On the night of 14 June 2022 or the early hours of the morning on 15 June 2022 Mr Wright took a deliberate overdose of his prescribed quetiapine medication at his home address. At the time he took the overdose he intended to take his own life. After he had taken the overdose he spoke to a friend on the phone and allowed her to call an ambulance for him. He also propped the front door open so that the ambulance would be able to gain access on their arrival. However, on the arrival of the ambulance crew Mr Wright was found to be deceased. His death was due to quetiapine toxicity.'","In the early hours of the morning on 15 June 2022 Mr Wright's friend [REDACTED] sent him a text message and Mr Wright called [REDACTED] and told [REDACTED] that he had taken [REDACTED] quetiapine tablets and he wanted to die. managed to persuade him to let [REDACTED] call an ambulance. At 04:58 [REDACTED] rang 999 and informed the operator that Mr Wright was conscious and breathing but that he had taken an overdose. provided the details of what he had taken. [REDACTED] Wright back and remained on the phone to him [REDACTED] the ambulance. At 05:26 [REDACTED] thought that Mr Wright was now unconscious and she did not know if he was breathing or not. At 06:40 an ambulance arrived at Mr Wright's address and he was pronounced deceased at 07:39. The court found that there was a delay from 05:10 onwards in carrying out an urgent clinical review of the first 999 call by staff at the Emergency Control Room at South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAMB). Had a clinical review taken place at 05:10, the call would have been upgraded to a Category 2 call with a target response time of 18 minutes from the original call. In fact, the call was not upgraded to a Category 2 call until [REDACTED] called back at 05:26, and thereafter an ambulance did not arrive at Mr Wright's address until 06:40, one hour and 14 minutes later. Whilst the above delays are clearly a matter of concern, the court was not persuaded that they materially contributed to Mr Wright's death. The initial delay at 05:10 was due to individual error and therefore does not form part of the concerns which you are asked to address in response to this report. However, the subsequent delay, which occurred following the second 999 call at 05:26, was because SECAMBS was in Stage 4 of its Surge Management Plan, meaning that demand for the service was significantly outstripping available resources and the service was not capable of responding to calls within target timeframes. During the inquest the court heard evidence from [REDACTED] Clinical Manager at SECAMBS Emergency Control Room. [REDACTED] gave evidence that during the last reported quarter, namely January to April 2023, SECAMBS had been operating at Stage 4 of its Surge Management Plan for 11.71 per cent of the time. In the previous quarter of September to December 2022, the Trust had been operating at Stage 4 for 45.73 per cent of the time. [REDACTED] informed the court that there were various reasons for SECAMBS being in Stage 4 of the Surge Management Plan on such a frequent basis, including lengthy waiting times to hand patients over to hospitals, insufficient staff numbers despite efforts to recruit both here and abroad, as well as high numbers of staff sickness. Whilst the reported figures indicate a notable reduction in the amount of time SECAMBS is spending in Stage 4 of the Surge Management Plan as compared with the latter half of 2022, it remains a matter of significant concern that the Trust is unable to respond to calls within target timeframes for 11.71 per cent of the time.","The MATTER OF CONCERN is: There is a risk of a future reoccurrence of the situation which arose on 14 June 2022 given that SECAMBS is regularly operating at Stage 4 of its Surge Management Plan, meaning that demand for the service is significantly outstripping available resources and the service is not capable of responding to calls within target timeframes. 7"

The medical cause of death was recorded as: 1a) Exsanguination 1b) Multiple incised wounds I recorded a Conclusion of Suicide.","Chris had enjoyed a long period of relative stability with his mental health until 2020/21. In the period that followed there were two serious attempts at overdose both of which resulted in lengthy admissions into ICU. He was admitted to Longreach and was known to the in-patient team. On 6//1/23, he was admitted into RCHT following an overdose. He was then transferred to Longreach and admitted on to Perran Ward on 22/1/23 before being transferred to Carbis and Cove wards on 25/1/23 and 6/2/23 respectively. He was admitted as an informal patient and, prior to his transfer to Cove ward, had a number of episodes of escorted leave. On 8/2/23, the inquest heard that Cove ward was understaffed with only one of three rostered nurses due to attend. Accordingly, the ward manager, [REDACTED], came to work early to assist her nursing colleagues. While treating another patient with suspected sepsis, Chris requested leave to go into the hospital's grounds. [REDACTED] accepted in evidence she had not had time to read Chris's RiO records and she did not then appreciate that his previous leave had only been escorted. She delegated to an HCA, in effect, to check that leave was appropriate before authorising it without conducting her own assessment of risk. There was a short delay in appreciating that Chris had not returned to the ward as anticipated. His body was discovered three days later.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

There is also an initiative to standardise documentation, for example, at handover, and later MDT (when risks are reviewed), to ensure this is incorporated into RiO, together with an express intention to involve the family in decision-making. It was accepted that risk should be assessed by a nurse prior to granting leave to an informal patient particularly where unescorted leave is being considered for the first time. Although Chris's death occurred in February 2022, it also became clear that the process had not been completed. It was hoped this could be achieved by the end of July this year but the inquest was told there would need to be consideration of the proposals by the different consultants now involved. I was concerned to ensure that the process was completed without undue delay and it is with this in mind that I now write to you. 6"

I recorded a conclusion of suicide. I concluded that her cause of death was : 1a Traumatic brain injury 2 Polytrauma","Lucy was born on 17th November 1997. She was 24 at the time of her death. Her death in hospital on 23 February 2022 happened after she jumped [REDACTED] on 16 February 2022. The key facts for the purposes of this report are as follows: Lucy had mild learning disabilities but had capacity to make her own decisions and go out alone. She needed support with everyday tasks and remembering to do things.Lucy lived in supported accommodation in Reading, funded by Wokingham Borough Council. A support worker was provided by a care provider (Dimensions). Mental Health Support: Lucy had some interactions with mental health services over the years, and we focused on her most recent contacts. Lucy was under the care of the Crisis Home Resolution and Treatment Team (CRHTT, hereafter referred to as 'the crisis team') between 11th January and 2nd February 2022, after an overdose. She was discharged from mental health services with a recommendation to refer herself to a group called SUN (Service Users Network). She had been told at that point that she did not meet the criteria for the learning disabilities team and was advised to speak to her GP herself from that point.She saw a mental health practitioner based at her GP surgery on 15th February, indicating that she had thoughts of jumping from a particular bridge in Reading. The crisis team was contacted. Their advice was that, Lucy had been discharged recently from the service, and that she did not meet the criteria for being taken on by them. The recommendation for Lucy to refer herself to the SUN group remained. They did not speak to Lucy at that point. They did not offer her support from other mental health teams. Safeguarding referrals · There was at least one earlier safeguarding referral, but we focused on those in the last 12 months of Lucy's life. · A safeguarding referral was sent to Reading Borough Council in May 2021 following an incident where Lucy took too many sleeping tablets. This report referenced Lucy's past history of deliberate self-harm. The evidence suggests that this was not reviewed by Reading Borough Council for almost 3 months – in August 2021 – when it was deemed to be an inappropriate referral on the basis that it did not describe abuse or neglect. · Between 10th and 20th January 2022, 3 separate safeguarding concerns were raised with Reading Borough Council. These are referred to below. · On the 10th January 2022, a safeguarding referral was made regarding an overdose of Nurofen tablets. · On the 18th January, there was an update on the above referral, but this related to additional incidents, including ingestion of bleach. When this was followed up by telephone (with the person who had made the referral) RBC's record of this conversation includes the following: Lucy has allegedly done a few more self-harm attempts…she is making several threats of suicide ([REDACTED] ) . Today she tried to [REDACTED] … her mental health seems to be deteriorating…Dimensions believe she needs more support than what they can provide as they are not mental health skilled professionals. · Subsequent to the referrals on 10th and 18th January, a social worker recorded that she did not think that Section 42 [of the Care Act] criteria were met. She also concluded that there was “ robust support from agencies involved and appropriate measures have been taken to address risks posed by her threats of self-harm. No serious harm has occurred to Miss Walles” . · On 20th January, South Central Ambulance Service Centre made a safeguarding referral. This referral relates to a previous overdose, and mental health deterioration. The report said that Lucy had told them she did not want to be here anymore. · During all of these safeguarding referrals, Lucy was not contacted at all. It appears that the only information taken into account in reaching conclusions was the initial safeguarding report itself and information on Reading Borough Council's computer system (Mosaic). These would have included earlier safeguarding reports. After the third safeguarding concern was raised by the ambulance service, no review or action took place before the tragic events of 16th February 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The concerns arising out of this investigation and inquest relate to the following key areas, Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 a) Safeguarding b) Mental health provision c) Inter-agency communication – particularly where there is some doubt over who should provide additional support needed by a person. We heard in evidence that in the months after Lucy's death, a Safeguarding Adults Board considered the case, but did not consider that a Safeguarding Adults Review ('SAR') should be undertaken. Evidence from Wokingham Borough Council was that they were not at that time aware of the number of safeguarding referrals that had been made. A decision was made (some six days before the inquest) that a SAR will now be conducted. The evidence of the Assistant Director of Adult Social Care was that this is likely to be completed within 1-3 months after the inquest. I have set out the issues / concerns that I have for each of the two recipients of this report, below. Reading Borough Council 1) Time scales for review and triage of safeguarding referrals. 2) Requirements to speak to the individual about whom safeguarding concerns have been raised. 3) Training around Section 42 and when a report meets the threshold for neglect or abuse. This training should also consider what options are available if a concern does not meet the threshold for a Section 42 enquiry. 4) Systems for making other involved agencies aware of safeguarding referrals and concerns. 5) In relation to each of the above points, whether RBC should reflect the above changes in formal (written) policy, as well as delivering training. 6) Improving interaction amongst agencies involved, and consideration of the threshold for arranging joint meetings to discuss service users, whether they meet Section 42 thresholds or not. The evidence we heard is that this is now being actively encouraged. Should there be written guidance about this somewhat subjective issue ? 7) Whether they consider that the resourcing of this service is adequate and safe. 8) Systems for auditing, and what will happen if the auditing reveals ongoing issues. Berkshire Health Care 1) How do the changes/proposed changes to systems (including the 'One Team' approach) make a difference? Specifically: a) Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would not be discharged from the crisis team without additional support, as she was on 2nd February? b) Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would be offered some support, whether by the crisis team or otherwise, in the situation that arose on the 15th February? 2) Do they consider that resourcing of these services is adequate and safe? 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr. Harris died as the result of suicide.,"In answer to the questions “when, where and how did Mr. Harris come by his death?”, the jury recorded as follows: “ On 27.5.22 Matthew David Harris was found in his cell at HMP Long Lartin having suspended himself [REDCATED]. As a result of his injuries he died on 29.5.22 at the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch. Matthew David Harris had a background of mental health and substance misuse issues.” Mr. Harris had been arrested on 13.5.22 by Dyfed-Powys Police on suspicion of murder, and was subsequently charged and remanded into custody at HMP Swansea on 16.5.22.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Following his arrest, and before he was interviewed about the alleged offence of murder, Mr. Harris was assessed by a consultant forensic psychiatrist, . Although concluded that Mr. Harris was fit to be detained and fit to be interviewed, he did note possible symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, likely due to some trauma in Mr. Harris' background, possible symptoms of a personality disorder, and “potentially a psychotic process, with potential underlying delusional beliefs”; 2 (2) During his police interview on 14.5.22, when describing his movements before the alleged murder had taken place, Mr. Harris told officers he had , intending to jump off in order to take his own life, but had decided against it because “I thought no, I've got to reveal all this first”; (3) Despite the fact that these comments revealed very recent suicidal ideation on Mr. Harris' part, no mention of them appears to have been made in any of the following documents: (a) The Person Escort Record ( PER ) and Suicide and Self-Harm ( SASH ) Warning forms which accompanied Mr. Harris from police custody at Haverfordwest Police Station to Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court on 16.5.22; (b) The PER and SASH Warning forms which accompanied Mr. Harris from Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court to HMP Swansea later that same day. (4) Although I was quite satisfied that the omission of these comments from the above documents made no difference to the sad outcome in this case, I am concerned that the failure by Dyfed-Powys Police officers to realise that such comments ought to be included on a PER and SASH Warning form, if repeated in future, may lead to a person in custody's risk of suicide and/or self-harm, being either underestimated, or ignored completely. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 June 2023. I recorded a conclusion of Suicide,"At 22:38 hours on 19 February 2023, [REDACTED] was found unresponsive the allowing morning and taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital where he underwent surgery to stem the extensive bleeding. Despite best supportive care, he died at the Royal Oldham Hospital on 21 February 2023. The Deceased had been released on bail from Worcester Police Station at 00:33 hours on 19 February 2023 after being detained for 24 hours. In the hours before his arrest, he had been identified by West Marcia Police as a high risk missing person because he had made threats to end his life. On arrival at the police station, the Custody Sergeant took steps to address the Deceased's risk of suicide by removing his belt, providing him with a rip proof blanket and making a referral to the Liaison and Diversion Service. The referral form included the fact that the Deceased had made threats to end his life. The Liaison and Diversion Practitioner (the Practitioner) attended the Deceased's cell at 10:03 hours on 18 February. A conversation took place through the observation hatch in the cell door which consisted of enquiring whether the Deceased wanted any help with unmet needs or vulnerabilities. During the conversation, the Deceased told the Practitioner that his thought of suicide had been a reaction to the allegations for which he was arrested and that these had now passed. The Court found that this conversation did not equate to a full assessment of the Deceased's risk of suicide or self-harm. Furthermore, the Practitioner indicated that it was not his role to assess whether the Deceased presented a risk of suicide or self-harm on release from custody. The Practitioner made no entry of his contact with the Deceased in the Detention Log. The Court found that there was a lack of clarity in the handover information given to the police as to what, if any, assessment had taken place.","6 7 8 During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:­ (1) No assessment of the risk of suicide or self-harm upon release took place during the Deceased's time in detention (2) There was a lack of clear communication to the Police as to what, if any assessment had taken place. (3) The conversation between the Practitioner and the Deceased took place through an observation hatch in circumstances where no risk was posed to the Practitioner from being in the same room as the Deceased. This was not best practice. (4) The terminology used by the Practitioner was misleading in that it suggested that there was no role for the liaison and Diversion service because no unmet needs or vulnerabilities had been identified. The evidence was that the Deceased had declined consent for an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities and therefore the notes should have made clear that an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities had not taken place. (5) The 'review' undertaken by a Health & Justice Operational Manager of the West Mercia Health & Justice Service consisted of duplication of the Practitioners statement with no comment, observations or identification of areas of learning."

The Rt Hon Suella Bravermen MP Secretary of State for the Home Department House of Commons London SW1A 0AA 1","On 16 June 2020, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Heather Findlay, aged 28 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today. At inquest, the jury came to a conclusion of death by suicide, making a narrative determination that I now attach, and giving a medical cause of death of: 1a hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 1b sodium nitrate toxicity","At the time of her death, Heather Findlay was in the care of the East London Foundation Trust (ELFT), detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act at Mile End Hospital. At approximately 3pm on 11 June 2020, she was on s17 escorted leave, standing with a healthcare assistant (HCA) at the front gates of the hospital having a cigarette, when she turned to the HCA, said “I'm sorry I have to do this to you” and ran away. ELFT contacted the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) at 3.17pm, but by 3.58pm, Ms Findlay had been found by a member of the public in a nearby park.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality. That means more than simply a change in policy wording. 3 2. By the time the HCA rang the duty senior nurse for advice Ms Findlay was out of sight, and so the HCA was instructed to return to the ward. I heard evidence that an email is to be sent out shortly to explain that a new ELFT absent without leave policy will be in place by the end of June 2023. The new policy will confirm that, if it is safe to do so an escort may follow a patient who has absconded, keeping them in line of sight whilst ringing the duty senior nurse for instructions. However, there is no ELFT policy for what those instructions should be or even what they could include. No member of ELFT gave evidence of any organisational thought having gone into how then to progress such a situation, other than the ward calling the police to report a missing person. No member of ELFT giving evidence was able to set out what the staff member following should do. This appears to be a significant omission. 3. Moreover, one of the MPS policy leads in this area gave evidence that in such a situation the police would not necessarily attend, even if called direct by a hospital staff member in the street following a patient about whom they are worried. I spent some time examining the police regarding this point, and I was left with the impression that a clinician calling the police in what the clinician perceived to be an emergency situation might not be assisted by the police. That concerned me. 4. I heard that Right Care, Right Person is an operational model developed by Humberside Police that changes the way the emergency services respond to calls involving concerns about mental health. I understand that it is in the process of being rolled out across the UK as part of ongoing work between police forces, health providers and government. I heard that the MPS has already created a similar model under the resource and demand team. The protocol is called Affinity. It attempts to target preventable demand from the mental health trusts. I was told that ELFT and the MPS work in partnership, so I asked the MPS what is meant to happen if an escort is following a patient who has run away and about whom the escort is worried. 4 I was told that this is primarily a health problem. It was pointed out that doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have the same powers as the police under section 18 of the Mental Health Act. Hospital employees have the legal authority to take a sectioned patient into custody and return them to hospital. However, I heard nothing of an ELFT protocol that would advise staff on the ward to come out to assist an escort who already following a patient. I heard nothing of a trust contingency plan that would allow a ward to function without the doctors and nurses needed to undertake such a task. I heard nothing of any training given to doctors and nurses in how to restrain a patient in the middle of the street and to transport them back to the ward. From the evidence I heard, the police / health trust partnership working allows each agency to regard such a situation as the other's responsibility, whilst nobody is on the ground attempting to retrieve a seriously ill patient who is meant to be inside a locked ward for their own safety. Whether this is a matter of policy or practice, the result is the same. If partner agency working is to be effective in caring for this extremely vulnerable cohort of patients, there needs to be crystal clear understanding by all those involved, from the highest policy maker to the most junior member of a team at the sharp end, of how to tackle these difficult situations and exactly who is meant to be doing what. 5. Evidence was given that the police classify a person at high risk as: the risk is immediate and there are substantial grounds for believing immediate risk of self harm. I was told by the MPS that, at the time of reporting to the MPS, trusts should volunteer their own grading of the patient's risk. The police said that they will not necessarily following the trust grading, but they regard it as a significant factor and it should form part of the MPS thinking. ELFT witnesses told me that if the police did not ask for the trust's grading then the trust would not offer it. I was told that, until April 2022 the grab pack prepared by ELFT for the MPS in such a situation was printed out and handed to police if & when the police attended the ward. It is now filled out on a portal as part of the reporting procedure. However, it is not clear to me how far the grab pack aligns with local policies, whether all useful information (including the trust's grading of risk) is recorded as a matter of routine, and how far the police and the trust are using the same terminology with the same definitions. It seems that this would benefit from consideration. 5 6. ELFT staff all told me that, after Ms Findlay had run off, they still graded her as medium rather than high risk. She had had long term suicidal thoughts, had made previous attempts on her life and, prior to being admitted to hospital on 20 May 2020 had purchased sodium nitrate and had planned to take this to kill herself. However, she had appeared to improve in hospital, and had been granted 15 minutes' escorted leave twice a day since 1 June without incident. At one point in her evidence it appeared to me that the matron, taking the point that by running away Ms Findlay had acted in a manner that was wholly unexpected by the trust, was of the view that Ms Findlay should then have been re-categorised as high risk. However, following re-examination by counsel for ELFT the matron appeared to retract this and to return to her former position that, even after she had run away Ms Findlay was only of medium risk to herself. It is of course a matter of clinical opinion what risk grading a patient should be given, and no person can see into the future. However, • the jury found a failure by ELFT to recognise that, by 11 June 2020, Ms Findlay was at imminent risk of suicide by sodium nitrate; and • any investigation following a death like Heather Findlay's presents an opportunity for sober and searching reflection. So I am concerned that an element of positional bias may have influenced the thinking of ELFT staff. I am concerned about this particularly because, when giving evidence at inquest, the ELFT serious incident investigation author was adamant that it was only appropriate for the HCA who called the police on 11 June 2020 after Ms Findlay had run away, to tell the police of a risk of self harm not of a risk of suicide. Her rationale for this was that the last time Ms Findlay had articulated a plan to kill herself, was when she was found in hospital with a ligature round her neck on 28 May 2020. This position seems lacking the necessary reflection. 6 I draw your attention to earlier prevention of future deaths reports (PFDs) as follows: • Sent to ELFT on 8 June 2023 by Assistant Coroner Buckett following the inquest touching the death of Hilary (Billy) Guedalla, including concern regarding the failure of ELFT to inform the police of the serious suicide risk that the deceased posed to themselves; and the confusion among staff about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing. • Sent to ELFT on 25 January 2023 by me following the inquest touching the death of Andrew Largin, including concern about omissions from a serious incident investigation. • Sent to ELFT on 20 October 2021 by me following the inquest touching the death of Freeda Glausiusz, including concern about a lack of learning culture at ELFT. 6"

The investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023. I made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows: 1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 2. On occasions, the deceased's psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life. 3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition. 4. At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life. 5. The deceased's condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward. 6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward. 7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day. 8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased's home address. 9. At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased's mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased's home address, between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021. 10. The deceased should not have been permitted to leave the ward alone. Had clinical staff observed the decision not to allow the deceased out without a staff member, the deceased would not have taken their own life when they did. 11. The decision that the deceased should not be permitted unescorted leave failed to be communicated to all staff members on the ward. 12. The information that the deceased had tried to end their own life on the ward on the evening of the 27th October 2021 was also not properly communicated to all staff on the ward or added to any document which concerned a proper risk of assessment of them. Also, the hospital staff did not fully comply with the patient admission policy when the deceased was admitted on the 26th October 2021 as records were not properly updated and no physical health assessment was made of the deceased within 24 hours. 13. The decision that the deceased was to receive 1:1 support following the ward round of the 28th October 2021 could not realistically be met because of staff shortages on the ward. There was a failure to recognise that this plan would could not realistically be achieved because of those staffing issues. 14. The assessment made of the deceased before the deceased was allowed to leave the ward at 6pm on the 29th October 2021 by that member of staff was inadequate as a risk assessment of the deceased's mental state for the purposes of assessing their safety. That member of staff relied solely on the deceased's presentation at that moment and did not consider any written record about the deceased or ask any other member of staff about how the deceased was. 15. There was a complete failure to appreciate the urgency of locating the deceased once the night staff found them to be missing at about 8pm on the 29th October 2021 and to follow the hospital policy which applied to missing patients. 16. Night shift staff took far too long to contact the emergency services and failed to contact the ambulance service as advised by the police in the early hours of the 30th October 2021. 17. When the police were contacted, staff completely failed to state the urgent and serious suicide risk which the deceased presented to themselves. 18. Hospital staff also failed to properly contact Billy's family and friends after they went missing from the ward or leave messages for them which could have enabled them to be located. 19. Staffing levels on both the 29th and 30th October 2021 were not adequate and this contributed to the failings set out above. 20. The failure set out above which relates to the staff member being unaware that the deceased should not leave the ward unaccompanied, amounts to a serious failure which directly caused or contributed to the deceased's death. 21. The other failures set out above amount to missed opportunities which may directly or indirectly, have prevented the deceased's death.",The circumstances surrounding the death are set out in Box 3 above.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that: 1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (“the unit”) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide. 2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made. 3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit. 4. The “Sign in/Sign out” book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods. 5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user 5 should be permitted to leave the unit. 6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased's medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident. 7. Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally. 8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing. 9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased's family once the deceased was found to be missing. 10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally. The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern. 6"

He had a past medical history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having had the diagnosis on 12 January 2022 and poorer mental health as a result. Other than the lymphoma he had no other significant past medical history. The anticipation of awaiting scans and treatment impacted severely upon his mental health but he had significant family support. Eifion was regularly reviewed by a GP and medicated accordingly. He had previous attempts at self-harm by way of medication overdose or self-inflicted injury. He had been under the care of the Community Mental Health Team including Home Treatment Team and primary care since early 2022 up to his death. His acts of self-harm were impulsive but serious. On 10 June 2022 Eifion had left his home address to attend his daughter's home across the road to let the cat out. There was a concern for Eifion when he did not reply to a text message from his wife around 15 mins later who then attended at their daughter's home and on opening the front door found Eifion suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion's GP had made a 'very urgent' referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation (SPOAA) on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this 'very urgent' referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients. b. During the evidence it was accepted that 'a' above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board's investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement. 2. An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion's death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner. Coroner's Office, County Hall, Wynnstay Road, Ruthin, LL15 1YN |"

The conclusion of the inquest was: Death from self-suspension while her cognition was seriously impaired by a very high blood alcohol level. 3 1a Hanging 1b 1c II Alcohol dependence,"The record of inquest read as follows: “Brenda Shields died in her home , [REDACTED], Carlisle on 8th December 2022. She took her life by ligature suspension while under the influence of a very high blood alcohol level”. A narrative conclusion was given. Brenda worked as a healthcare assistant in A&E at Cumberland Infirmary, she had for some time been alcohol dependent with binge sessions which often caused domestic friction with her husband, there was an incident of domestic violence requiring police involvement. Matters had been worse since she developed cauda Equina Syndrome which required neurosurgical intervention in 2021, and had ongoing low back pain which she tended to medicate with alcohol. She had had episodes of anxiety in 2005 & 2007, depression on 2016 & suicidal ideation in 2018. On 26/10/22 she was admitted to A&E in Carlisle (her own workplace) with an intentional overdose. She was followed up and treated by her GP. On 10/11/21 there was a serious incident when she was found by police on the riverbank, she had intended to enter the water but was talked down from this by her GP. Brenda was admitted to hospital [Hadrian unit] as a voluntary patient. Brenda was not comfortable in the ward environment and on 14/11/21 discharged home to be followed up by the Crisis Team who did visit her at home the following day. Brenda's GP was not informed of her admission or discharge so was unaware of events until a prearranged telephone call on the 15th. Brenda was followed up at home and by telephone, at several contacts she was noted to be under the influence of alcohol. Brenda was discharged after a final “MDT” meeting on 6/12/22 [it is not clear who was involved], declining further input and denying any thoughts of self harm, a risk assessment on 8/12/22 records low or no apparent risks, this was the day Brenda died.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) Brenda was discharged without any planned follow up. Her family were not involved in the discharge process despite assurances that they would be, her GP did not receive discharge notification from the Hadrian unit until 8 days after the event or from the Crisis team until 10 days after Brenda's death. Referrals promised from Hadrian unit to Drug/Alcohol services and Persistent Physical Symptoms Service were not made. (2) Inadequate weight seems to have been given to Brenda's alcohol problems and her assurances that all was, and would continue to be well were accepted at face value despite her recent history, her family find it hard to understand how she could be graded low risk on the day she died. (3) I refer you to the PFD report I issued referring to Charlotte Grace on 29/10/19. Assurances were given in response to that report which again focused on discharge without family/carer involvement which is surely paramount. I note actions mentioned in the incident report in this case but am still concerned that similar events may occur in future."

The inquest was resumed and concluded on 25/5/23. I found that the cause of death to be: 1a. asphyxia (hanging) I arrived at a narrative conclusion: Robert Newton Stevenson intended to take his own life when the balance of his mind was disturbed.","Mr Stevenson was a 63 year old gentleman who was a very respected and experienced Consultant Cardiologist and General Physician at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, who resigned his post in May 2022 to enter full retirement. On 6/5/22 he was referred to the urology department for the investigation of possible prostate cancer, when a decision was also made to consult a private Consultant Urologist. In order to relieve his symptoms of prostatitis and to make him ready for an investigative biopsy, he was prescribed Ciprofloxacin on 19/5/22 at a dose of [REDACTED]. He had no previous history of depression or mental health problems. Subsequently on the morning of 30/5/22 Mr Stevenson left his home address on his own for his usual walk. He had not previously given any indications to his family for them to be concerned for him. Thereafter at approximately 12.30pm his wife received a Facebook message from Mr Stevenson to indicate that he had left a note under the pillow of his bed. The note was found to be uncharacteristically confused and illogical given his reference to his baseless concerns that he may have developed AIDs after taking a HIV tester kit he had previously bought on line. Concerns were raised for his welfare, and this trigged an intensive police and family search of the surrounding area. Subsequently, Mr Stevenson was found hanging [REDACTED]. Upon the arrival of the paramedics, although resuscitative attempts were made, it was confirmed very sadly that he had passed away.","During the inquest I was referred by Mr Stevenson's treating urologist to published literature relating to Ciprofloxacin and Quinolone antibiotics and a potential rare link to Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 suicide behaviour in patients, although I found on the balance of probabilities that it remained unclear that he was suffering from this side effect, it remained possible for this to be the case. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) • I heard evidence to suggest that the prescribing doctor did not reference this side effect at the time of issuing the prescription to Mr Stevenson, since it was not in accord with current advice. • I also heard evidence to suggest that prescribing doctors may not be fully aware of this rare side effect, and that patient's suffering from depression may be more vulnerable to it. • I am therefore concerned that this potential risk has not been given sufficient emphasis and I would ask you to consider the appropriateness of reviewing the current guidelines as to the dispensation of the drug to patients by clinicians and increasing the awareness of the side effect in order to monitor and mitigate the risks. 6"

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Following the death of Mr. Wood a review was conducted by the trust and the review recognised that it would have been helpful if the symptoms of delirium had been highlighted to the GP and that it would have been useful if there had been a discussion with Mrs Wood to educate her as to the possibility of delirium, and to help plan his discharge from hospital and inform her when she should seek further medical assistance, The protocols for discharge following heart surgery should be reviewed in order to prevent Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 similar deaths. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 May 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr. Harper died as the result of suicide.,"In answer to the questions “when, where and how did Mr. Harper come by his death?”, I recorded as follows: 'On 8.7.22 Nigel Harper, who had over the previous month been experiencing severe depression and anxiety, and living with thoughts of self-harm, took an intentional overdose of prescribed sedative and hypnotic medications. He was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital where, despite treatment, he continued to decline, and died on 23.7.22.” Mr. Harper lived in Scotland, but in the period leading up to his death had been staying with his sister near Malvern. He had a lengthy mental health history, which included a recent inpatient admission to a psychiatric hospital in Edinburgh.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty t? report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ­ (1) On 4 July 2022 Mr. Harper attended the Emergency Department at Gloucester Royal Hospital, and was seen by a nurse from the Mental Health Liaison team there, who recorded that he was very anxious and distressed, and voicing onaoina thouahts of suicide. The nurse felt that Mr. Haroer would benefit from a l period of treatment under the care of the Home Treatment Team, and because Mr. Harper was living in Worcestershire at the time, and because it was now in the early hours of the following day, he called the Worcestershire Crisis Team to arrange that. The nurse concerned was under the impression that by making this phone call, and passing on Mr. Harper's details to the Crisis Team, he was referring Mr. Harper's case to them. He told the inquest that he was expecting mental health services in Worcestershire to arrange a further urgent assessment of Mr. Harper, and he therefore ensured that Mr. Harper was told to expect the Crisis Team to contact him to arrange a further assessment. (2) The Clinical Lead for the Crisis Team in Worcestershire gave evidence to the inquest that whilst the Crisis Team did receive a request from the nurse at Gloucester that night, they interpreted it only as a request for further assessment ( but not an urgent one ), and not as a request that Mr. Harper be referred to the Home Treatment Team. (3) In the event, an urgent assessment was not arranged, and Mr. Harper's case was only considered by the Home Treatment Team in Worcestershire when his temporary GP in Worcestershire, out of further concern for Mr. Harper's mental health, made a new and separate referral to them. (4) I have concluded that the events described above arose out of a lack of understanding between the two NHS Trusts concerned ( Herefordshire & Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( HWHCT ) and Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( GHCT ) ) as to how each other's mental health services are run ­ otherwise arrangements would have been made for Mr. Harper's mental health to be assessed urgently, as was intended. (5) If staff at HWHCT and GHCT do not understand how to make urgent mental health referrals or requests for urgent mental health assessments to each other, there remains a risk that other deaths may occur in similar circumstances in the future. 6"

The jury recorded a conclusion of SUICIDE .,"On 26th March 2021 at approximately 10.11am in cell A3-10 at HMP Lewes, Andrew Dean was found with a ligature around his neck [REDACTED]. He was treated at the scene by prison staff, healthcare staff and paramedics. Andrew Dean was declared dead at 11.27am at HMP Lewes.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Following his arrival at HMP Lewes on 24 March 2021, Mr Dean was offered and attempted to make his initial 'first night' phone call but did not manage to speak to anyone. Over the next 36 hours, he made requests of prison staff for another opportunity to make a phone call, which were refused. During the same period, his partner tried to contact the prison through the prison switchboard, but was not able to make any contact with him. In his suicide note to his partner, Mr Dean wrote “I tried to get to talk to you but these lot here wouldn't let me.” I am concerned that there are no clearly defined processes to ensure that new prisoners can successfully make first contact with family members (when this does not take place on the first night) and for logging and handling incoming calls to the central switchboard from family members with concerns about a prisoner's safety and/or requesting a welfare check. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Following the inquest, I gave the Ministry of Justice an opportunity to address these concerns by providing further evidence of any new procedures that have been put in place since Andrew Dean's death, but they declined to do so. In my view, these are matters that require further consideration by the Ministry of Justice and HMP Lewes to avoid a risk of future deaths through self-harm or suicide.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18 May 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion: Conrad Colson took his own life whilst suffering from severe body dysmorphic disorder. At the time of his death, he was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatments; he was not receiving a therapeutic level of medication and he was not in receipt of any professional mental health support for his body dysmorphic disorder. He had been discharged from mental health services without any robust risk assessment and without the safety net of a fully considered risk management/relapse plan.","Conrad Colson suffered from severe body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). The symptoms from this condition had led to a serious suicide attempt in February 2020. In 2021, following several months on the waiting list, Conrad received highly specialised therapy from the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma (CADAT). He made significant progress in managing his BDD symptoms during this therapy, however there was a known risk of relapse. He completed the sessions with his CADAT therapist in November 2021. Before and during this therapy, he had also received support from his local mental health trust's Peer Open Dialogue Team. As he had made such good progress with CADAT and as he had requested discharge from the Peer Open Dialogue Team, he was also discharged from this team in November 2021. There was no joint multi-disciplinary risk assessment and risk management plan on discharge from the teams. The practitioners were aware that Conrad was not taking a therapeutic dose of medication at the time of discharge, but no medical review was arranged for him. At the time of discharge from services, Conrad was also accessing treatment from an aesthetic dermatology clinic. This was not taken into account in his discharge risk assessment. Conrad had raised concerns with the skin clinic about his skin and the treatment, in December 2020; January 2021; March and April 2021. On the 27 and 28 February 2022, Conrad again raised concerns about the appearance of his skin, following treatment at the aesthetic dermatology clinic. His friends became concerned for his welfare when they could not reach him on the 2 March 2022. Emergency services attended and sadly Conrad was found deceased within his home address. The evidence at the inquest revealed that Conrad took his own life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. A concern arose at the Inquest hearing in relation to the absence of liaison between the highly specialist services of the CADAT team and the stepdown 3 services provided by NELFT. There was a lack of full information sharing around risk and joint risk assessment/risk management planning on discharge. 2. Both mental health services were aware that Conrad was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatment. There was a concern that neither service adequately highlighted the risks of accessing such treatment to Conrad or attempted to share information with the skin clinic. The inquest heard that patients with BDD should be fully informed of the risks of seeking aesthetic dermatology treatment and wherever possible, clinics who are providing treatment should be made aware of the BDD diagnosis. 3. The Inquest heard that there is a need for training to be provided to step-down service teams in relation to the diagnosis of BDD and the risks associated with it. 4. The inquest heard that there is a lack of national resources for BDD. The highly specialised service at South London and Maudsley has a very long waiting list (several months). This is on a background of concerns of a likely increase in BDD. In light of this concern, I am also providing this report to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, to the Department for Health & Social Care and to NHSE. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16th February 2023. The Jury's narrative conclusion of the inquest was that: Michael Bray died by way of misadventure. Points that possibly contributed to Michael's death include: The Fast Action Response Plan, and whether it should have been updated to include risks arising from the near-miss on 23 September 2021 and PC Cook's view by 4th October 2021 that the risks of suicide / misadventure had risen to high. Whether the Police should have deployed resources upon learning, at about 2.02am on 10th October 2021, that Michael was no longer on the telephone to the mental health professionals together with the knowledge that an ambulance could take up to 120 minutes to arrive. Whether the Ambulance Service should have asked Police to deploy a resource because of delays in sourcing an available ambulance. The Ambulance Service omission to bring the Police declining to attend, at about 3.18am, to the attention of the Ambulance dispatcher, leading to a one- hour delay in the dispatcher becoming aware that Police would not attend. The appropriateness of the ambulance crew's dynamic risk assessment on arrival at Michael's home address and their decision not to approach his house and check his door and check welfare. The period of time taken for the ambulance crew to chase for the whereabouts of Police attendance. The timing of any escalation of the Ambulance Service request for Police attendance. Shortcomings in software and communication systems, amongst agencies Poor interpretation, misunderstanding and poor analysis of the information available to agencies concerned. The sharing and agreement of actions, at times lacked urgency. The police failing to complete a welfare check after an initial call from the Crisis Team. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1(a) Hanging","The Jury's answer to how, when, where and in what circumstances the deceased came by his death was: Michael Bray was at home on 9th and 10th October 2021 He had been drinking alcohol and called the Crisis Helpline stating [REDACTED] considering hanging himself. After the call, he proceeded, resulting in his death sometime between 1:55-5:53, 10th October 2021 After the conclusion of the evidence, I ruled that on the evidence the Jury could not safely make any finding of fact on the balance of probabilities on the precise time of death other than that death occurred between about 1.50am and 5.53am on 10th October 2021. The Jury were directed to, and did, answer the question of when the deceased died accordingly. A notable feature of this case was a lack of availability or provision of an ambulance to respond in a timely manner to the deceased's Category 2 call, which contributed to a considerable delay. On the evidence, the national ambulance target response time for a Category 2 call is an average of 18 minutes, with 90% of calls to be responded to within 40 minutes. In this case, the ambulance response took a period of time in the hours, considerably greater than the target response time.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: – Although it could not be safely said when the deceased died, and therefore it could not safely be said that the delay in the ambulance response probably contributed to the death, the concern is that long delays in ambulance response to Category 2 calls create a risk that other deaths will occur in the future. Bearing in mind the national ambulance target response time for a Category 2 call of an average of 18 minutes, with 90% of calls to be responded to within 40 minutes: The average Category 2 response time for the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust ('EEAST') in October 2021, the month of this death, was 56 minutes and 2 seconds. The same average time for January 2023, the most recent month for which data was available, was 49 minutes and 3 seconds. Every month since the deceased's death, EEAST's Category 2 response time has been above the 90th centile time of 40 minutes. The average EEAST Category 2 response time for a given month in the period from October 2021 to January 2023 is over 1 hour, with a standard deviation of about 20 minutes. Therefore, EEAST's Category 2 response time remains persistently and consistently far off target. Although I accept on the evidence that action is being taken, on both local and national levels, to prevent future deaths as a result of this issue, the evidence of the results of such actions to date is that these actions have been demonstrably ineffective and have not resulted in a Category 2 average response time for EEAST that is even close to the target time. The evidence received was that this issue, and the causes for it and the action required, are not just local in nature, but also national. 6"

He was 29 years of age at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6th March 2023. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging,"The deceased was Samuel Alexander Morgan. At the time of his death Samuel was suffering from alcohol addiction and had a diagnosis of ADHD and social anxiety. Prior to his death Samuel had received treatment from the Community Drug and Alcohol Treatment ('CDAT') team and primary mental health services. Samuel was discharged from CDAT fifteen months prior to his death. CDAT had information on their system (including from their own risk assessment) to indicate that Samuel had been assessed as a significant risk of suicide. There was other valuable information about Samuel's risk factors on the CDAT system. At the time when Samuel was under CDAT the GP had also referred Samuel to the community mental health team raising his concerns about Samuel's risk of suicide. It is not clear is CDAT had access to this letter. When the primary mental health services consultant began treating Samuel for his ADHD – which continued up to Samuel's death – he received a referral from CDAT but he did not have access to the detailed information on the CDAT electronic system. The consultant could not and did not see the CDAT risk assessment, the outcome and assessment from the individual CDAT sessions and other vital historical information of potential relevance to Samuel's risk factors and triggers for suicide.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 The first MATTERS OF CONCERN is as follows: I am concerned that in cases where an individual is receiving treatment from alcohol and drug addiction services and treatment from the primary community mental health team that neither team is able to access the other teams records electronically. The lack of integrated electronic records between treating team means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis - such as substance misuse and mental health - given these are often complex cases. This is particularly the case where complex cases have not been referred into secondary mental health services and so do not have access to a care-coordinator who can oversee and understand the views of the various professionals treating and assisting an individual. I am concerned that the lack of such an integrated electronic system of medical and treatment records inhibits the effective sharing of information regarding patient safety and so increases the risk that information of significance regarding a risk to life will be lost between agencies and not sufficiently understood between all those managing risk. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 May 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Stuart Michael Robinson arrived at HMP Altcourse on 3rd March 2021 after receiving a 26 week sentence for breach of license. He was due to be released on 1st June 2021. He arrived with a history of attempted suicide and self-harm. On the 8th April, a ACCT book was opened following the interception of a letter detailing Mr Robinson's intention of suicide. Subsequently he was put under a regime of 5 observations an hour and 2 meaningful conversations per day. On the 9th April he underwent a mental health assessment and the first ACCT case review reduced the number of hourly observations to 3, with the number of meaningful conversations remaining at 2 per day. A care plan was put in place as part of this first case review. On the 14th April at a second case review, the observations were removed entirely, however the meaningful conversations remained at 2 per day. On the evening of 18th April Mr Robinson self-harmed, leading to hourly observations being reinstated. This led to the 3rd case review being brought forward to the 19th April. Hourly checks were once again removed and Mr Robinson continued to have 2 meaningful conversations. On 23rd April Mr Robinson self-harmed again, leading to the fourth case review being brought forward. On this same date Mr Robinson's podmate was released from prison and Mr Robinson was therefore alone in his cell. Mr Robinson was last seen at 7 pm on the 24th April. In the early hours of 25th April between approximately 12 am and 1 am, Mr Robinson applied a ligature [REDACTED] ultimately resulting in his death by suicide. His body was discovered at 5am and a code blue was called. Medical staff attended the scene but it was clear that Mr Robinson was incapable of resuscitation. Mr Robinson was declared dead at 5:16 am.",,"Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) This inquest highlighted the significant numbers of prisoners who enter the prison system with known or undiagnosed mental health issues. Whilst ACCT 6 requires multidisciplinary attendance at review meetings, this case highlighted the need for specific attendance of an RMN or other mental health expert at any review, (Mr Robinson had repeatedly self harmed prior to committing suicide but had presented without concern at each review which had been carried out without any input from the mental health team). The prison in question now operates a local policy to ensure someone from the mental health team attends all ACCT reviews irrespective of other disciplines attending. This has enabled the prison to identify issues which may not be picked up by other professionals involved, to enable support to be put in place by way of separate care plans which has had a notable impact upon SASH in the prison. 6"

The investigation concluded with an inquest which I heard on 25th April 2023. A post mortem examination confirmed that Mr Howe died as a consequence of: 1)a) Suspension by a Ligature around the Neck. The conclusion of the inquest was one of Suicide.","Mr Howe was found dead on 19th October 2022 on the A18 in Lincolnshire having suspended himself by the neck with a ligature in the back of his lorry. Mr Howe had experienced a dramatic deterioration in his mental health and had sought specialist help on numerous occasions. At the time of his death, Mr Howe was awaiting a further assessment by the Military Veterans Service having been discharged by the Access Team without any diagnosis or treatment plan being in place.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The Trust's own investigation into events leading to Mr Howe's death did not consider the full extent of his contacts with mental health services, lacked any meaningful degree of critical analysis of events, and omitted to seek to explore fundamental issues such as access to services from the patient's perspective. As a consequence, it is a matter of concern that the Trust has not taken the opportunity to derive all available learning from Mr Howe's death."

The investigation concluded on the 18th April 2023 and the conclusion was one of Suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) Drug Toxicity,"On 15th April 2022, Rebecca Alice fisher was found deceased by her family in a secluded area of Reddish Vale. Post-mortem examination included toxicology. She had a fatal dose of drugs in her system including pregabalin. [REDACTED] Rebecca had been reported by the Norbury Ward to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) as a high-risk missing person on the 11th April at about 6pm after she failed to return from 30 minutes of unescorted leave. Rebecca had a complex mental health history [REDACTED]. She had been admitted to the Norbury ward as a crisis patient. [REDACTED]. She had been allowed to leave for 30 minutes of unescorted leave. It was recognised that this presented a risk. Her failure to return was correctly assessed by hospital staff as creating an escalated risk and a high-risk situation. Greater Manchester Police failed to correctly assess her as a high-risk missing person. As a consequence, this meant that mobile telephone enquiries were not immediately undertaken, and the investigation did not have specialised input in the hours immediately following her being reported missing. It is probable that if these enquiries had taken place Greater Manchester Police would have known she was in the area of her home address and Reddish Vale. It is possible that Rebecca would have been found before she died had she been treated as a high-risk missing person.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The inquest heard evidence that GMP have guidance to support officers in assessing risk and guiding actions when there is a missing person report. The evidence was that despite the existence of the policy/document the risk was not recognised as being high risk and the appropriate actions were not taken immediately. The evidence indicated that a number of factors were key in this failure to accurately assess the risk. This included: 1. Poor understanding by GMP staff of the fact that a patient detained on a voluntary basis in a mental health ward could still be high risk if they failed to return; 2. Lack of understanding by GMP staff that the use by mental health units of short periods away from the unit to support a patient's recovery did not mean a patient could not be high risk if they did not return; 3. Lack of understanding by officers of how to apply the golden hour guidance and what was the expectation in terms of timeliness of undertaking the steps within the guidance coupled with a lack of understanding by some officers of the way/cost to GMP in accessing mobile phone data such as cell site; and 4. Poor quality documentation and information sharing between officers and supervision in relation to information from the family and the mental health unit. The inquest was told that GMP had rolled out an Aide Memoire system to try to embed greater consistency and understanding of the policy across GMP. The Aide Memoires were recognised as being an effective tool. However, there was no evidence available to assist in understanding if the Aide Memoires were being used effectively across the force and how GMP were measuring the implementation of them. Evidence was given to the inquest that GMP have introduced further training on missing persons. However, the effectiveness of that training was unclear given witnesses who had been on the training who gave evidence remained of the view that Rebecca was not a high-risk missing person despite all of the evidence available at the inquest. 2 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 05 April 2023. The inquest, which was held with a jury, ended with a narrative conclusion. The medical cause of death was 1(a) hanging. The jury concluded, amongst other matters, that: Relevant information about Mr Huntley, namely information from the recall notification and previous 'Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork' (ACCT) documents, was not recorded on NOMIS. The risk level recorded in the ACCT document opened on the 23/05/2020 did not reflect a higher level of risk indicated by witness evidence and neither did it align with the guidance on risk levels contained within that document. This caused or contributed to Mr Huntley's death. There was a failure to record triggers for self-harm behaviour in the ACCT document. There was a failure to record all relevant risks within the 'Caremap' section of the ACCT document. These factors contributed to the death of Mr Huntley. The level of observations under the ACCT document opened on the 23/05/2020 were not adequate based on the level of risk Mr Huntley posed to himself. This caused or contributed to his death.","Mr Huntley was recalled to prison on the 23/05/2020. Whilst in the community Mr Huntley had been under the care of Steps to Wellbeing for PTSD and anxiety. He had disclosed daily suicidal thoughts to them with no intent to act upon these thoughts. The recall notification of the 22/5/20 stated that Mr Huntley reported low mood and claimed to want to take his own life but was not brave enough to do so. This information from the recall notice was not recorded in the record keeping system which could be accessed by all prison security staff (NOMIS). Mr Huntley denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm when asked by the police on the 23/02/2020. During the reception process at HMP Winchester he denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm. On the 25/05/2020 Mr Huntley called for help [REDACTED]. He later disclosed that this had been a planned act with the intent to end his own life. He had taken steps to avoid being discovered and had only called for help when he awoke [REDACTED]. . Mr Huntley was subsequently taken to hospital and discharged later the same morning. Having left hospital he collapsed and was admitted to the Healthcare wing of the prison for observations. An ACCT document was opened. This is a way of monitoring persons in custody who are at risk of harm. During previous periods of imprisonment in 2010 and 2016 ACCT documents had been opened for Mr Huntley. These documents were not contained within in core records as should have been the case and still cannot be located. Their existence, and the circumstances of the 2016 ACCT, were recorded on NOMIS. Mr Huntley was initially placed on 30-minute observations when the 2023 ACCT was opened, this was reduced to hourly observations after the first case review on the 25/05/2020 and then to 3 random observations overnight after the second case review on the 27/05/2020. These changes were made following assessment meetings involving Mr Huntley, prison staff and staff from the NHS Trust providing physical and mental health interventions within the prison. Mr Huntley denied further thoughts of self-harm or suicide during these meetings. On the 28/05/2020 Mr Huntley was moved from his original cell in the healthcare wing to cell 13. Cell 13 was located in the area of the healthcare unit primarily used for patients with mental health difficulties. Apart from cells 6 and 13 all of the cells in this area were designed to have reduced ligature points. However in 2019 telephone points had been installed in each of these cells which protruded from the wall. The decision to move Mr Huntley was made at a Multi-disciplinary meeting at which no-one who had met Mr Huntley to assess his mental health was present. On the evening of the 28/05/20 the night duty prison officer completed their rounds at approximately 20.30 and noted that Mr Huntley was sat on the floor of his cell in a partial blind spot. Between 21.00 and 21.30 the nurse on duty knocked on Mr Huntley's cell door and received a verbal response. At about 23.30 the prison officer attended to complete the first observations required under the ACCT document for Mr Huntley. They saw that Mr Huntley was in the same position as some 3 hours earlier and Mr Huntley did not respond to him. The officer entered the cell with other prison officers at about 23.35 and found Mr Huntley sat motionless [REDACTED]. The prison officers cut the ligature and commenced CPR. An emergency call was put out and further prison officers and both on-duty nurses attended. Those present provided CPR to Mr Huntley until the arrival of paramedics. Sadly despite the efforts of staff and the attending medics Mr Huntley could not be revived and his life was declared extinct.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) ACCT documents In evidence at the inquest ACCT assessors and case managers accepted that they had not complied with various mandatory actions required under PSI 64/2011: Managing Prisoner Safety in Custody. They were not able to identify in evidence the risk factors it was mandatory to consider for persons at risk of suicide or self-harm. They had not recorded triggers in the relevant section of the ACCT nor recorded all risk factors in the Caremap section. One ACCT case manager stated that they did not know whether it was necessary to record a trigger if action had been taken to mitigate it. They also stated they categorised risk based on 'remaining' risk after action had been taken despite having not recorded the trigger. This leads me to have 2 concerns: The first regards the provision and quality of ACCT training and refresher training given this evidence was given some 2 years after the death of Mr Huntley and well after the disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. I also heard evidence that despite an ACCT being a 'whole prison' document (which can and should be opened by any member of staff) training was not mandatory for non-security staff. In 2019 there was no joint training for prison and heathcare staff on the use of ACCT documents. I am informed by CNWL that under ACCT v6 (which has been in force since July 2021) joint training is provided for and this is reassuring. However I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest some 20 months after this version came into force. The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager mentioned above advised that he had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of his ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on Mr Huntley and apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents the quality of the audits is brought into question. Information sharing. In evidence it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS which healthcare staff do not have access to. Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings. In addition a decision relating to Mr Huntley's care (i.e. the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff. of HMP Winchester informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT and any relevant information is share via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS and the multi disciplinary team. could not assist me with whether this was a HMP Winchester initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate. My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered. Cells At HMP Winchester within the area, considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff, as the 'mental health' cells there are 2 cells which are not equipped in a way to reduce the amount of available ligature points. It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting on the 28/05/2020 that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move Mr Huntley to the 'mental health cells' simply due to the fact he was on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy of CNWL has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. HMP Winchester informed me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition I was informed that all telephone points in the 'mental health cells' at HMP Winchester have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments. However at inquest those representing the HMPPS could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so. I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells which prison and health care staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self harm. The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells at HMP Winchester. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed at HMP Winchester or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that HMP Winchester experience high levels of self-harm and suicide and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing the HMPSS at the were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ­ 1. A failure to adequately assess risk of harm - Poor record keeping and a failure to read electronic records meant that important information was not considered at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (""MDT"") ward round on 6th April 2021 . The MDT arrived at a conclusion that Mr Charles' risk of self-harm was ""no risk"". A psychologist's assessment on the clinical record that assessed Mr Charles risk of self-harm as high on 31/3/21 was neither read nor incorporated into the MDT discussion. 2. A decision to reduce observation frequency made by the MDT on 6/4/21 was not supported by the Trust Policy guidance which indicated that enhanced observations were appropriate. 3. A failure to ensure that a treatment plan was followed - observations between 16.00 and 17.00 on the day of Mr Charles' death were suspended by the ward shift co-ordinator. The decision meant all patients subject to general observation on the ward were ignored. 4. Failures to respond to an emergency adequately - The Trust described the emergency response as chaotic . Staff agreed that they ""panicked"" and did not follow policy, specific issues include; a. A ward emergency bell was not sounded, b. An anti-barricade key was not used to open Mr Charles' door, instead the door was forced open causing a risk of harm to Mr Charles. C. A ligature cutter could not be used promptly as it was secured in a box with a combination lock - staff did not know the combination, d. Duty doctors were not called promptly, e. Oxygen administration was delayed, f. An on-site defibrillator was not used by staff g. Staff could or would not provide a clear and relevant history to paramedics. 5. The credibility of evidence provided by Trust staff. a. Two Trust witnesses declined to answer questions put to them regarding whether their observation records were truthful. b. Observation records appeared to have been created utilising a ""cut and 2 paste"" function. C. Records often inaccurately recorded the prescribed frequency of observation. d. Factually inaccurate entries were made in the record following Mr Charles' death. On 11th April 2021 an entry stated that Mr Charles was, ""Awake in his bedroom sitting on his bede (sic)"" at 07.21 . On 12th April two entries made at 9.48 and 11 .40 recorded that Mr Charles' was alive and well. Senior Trust witnesses characterised these entries as dishonest. 6. Governance process failings. a. A datix incident report created on the evening of 10th April 2021 by a senior nurse and Modern Matron contained misleading information that suggested that emergency response policies were followed when in fact they were not. b. The Datix failed to mention that observations had been suspended by the shift coordinator, a fact that was understood at that time. This obvious and significant piece of information that should have been escalated through the Trust governance team for action. C. The Trust 72 hour report was written by the Modern Matron and was signed-off by an integrated care director on 15th April 2021. This document also failed to identify or escalate the significant issue of the suspension of observation at 16.00 on 10th April 2021 . d.

SW15 2SR 1","On the 24th, 25th and 26th April 2023 evidence was heard touching the death of Mrs Elsie Leaver. She had died on 23rd August 2020, aged 89 years. Medical Cause of Death 1 (a) Multiple organ failure (b) Mixed drug overdose 11 Depressive illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Ischaemic heart disease, Hypertension, Frailty. How, when, where the deceased came by her death: Mrs Leaver was admitted to St George's Hospital, (SGH) on 15th August 2020 suffering with phenytoin toxicity. She had an extensive psychiatric history recently complicated by overdose and suicidality. This was not recognised by the clinical team despite evidence available in the electronic records, concerns raised by the family and intermittent agitation. She was deemed to have reduced mental capacity between 16th August 2020 and her discharge for rehabilitation to Queen Mary's Hospital (QMH) on 18th August 2020, but her bag was not searched. [REDACTED] On transfer to QMH, she was found to have capacity and again refused a bag search. Overnight on 19th August 2020, she expressed suicidality to her family who notified nursing staff at QMH. On 20th August 2020, this suicidality was explored by the SHO who found her not to be actively suicidal and sought no advice from the psychiatric liaison service. On 22nd August 2020, whilst collateral psychiatric history was being sought after she threatened self-discharge, at approximately 15:00 she took an overdose [REDACTED] Mrs Leaver was readmitted to SGH and died there on ITU at 16:37 23rd August 2020 as a result of the overdose. The failures in care and communication together constitute a “total picture” that amounts to neglect. Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death: Mrs Leaver took her own life whilst suffering from depressive illness. Her death was contributed to by neglect.",". Extensive evidence was taken and accepted by the court. In summary, of relevance to this report: On 14th August 2020 Mrs Leaver attended SGH with 3 odd episodes though to be due to a TIA and discharged on aspirin. She re-attended with a history of a fit with a past history of epilepsy on phenytoin on 15th August 2020 and was admitted to SGH under the medical team. The neurologist thought it likely that her phenytoin would be low and when it was found to be in the toxic range ascribed the fit to phenytoin toxicity and she was admitted for monitoring, stopping phenytoin, and restarting once levels back to normal. No active consideration was given as to the possible cause of this toxicity, which could have been due to overdose, given her psychiatric history as outlined below. Despite being under active psychiatric care from the CMHT for older persons, being on psychiatric medication, taking a call from the CMHT whilst an inpatient at SGH, having taken an overdose in November 2019, having multiple hospital attendances, including 17th July 2020 with suicidal ideation to Kingston, suffering agitation, concerns being raised about her mental health by her family, a safeguarding concern being raised against her partner/friend, and intermittent agitation requiring diazepam, 1:1 nursing, the attendance of her son and hospital security and presenting with drug toxicity, psychiatric illness was never considered. She was seen by multiple clinicians at SGH, none of whom undertook any psychiatric history, or made any proper inquiry with her relatives, nor of her electronic notes. This deprived her of a holistic assessment. There was no referral to psychiatric liaison services, nor advice sought from them at either site. Mrs Leaver therefore did not have a self-harm risk assessment despite her presentation and past history, which would have likely prompted more active searching of her belongings for medication which could be potentially used in an overdose. This could have been undertaken even against her permission when she had reduced capacity in her best interests. Mrs Leaver had declined a bag search on admission to the ward at SGH which was apparently passed on verbally to the day team. This did not appear to have been acted upon and was not recorded, such that a search never occurred. This was compounded by the fact that when psychiatric illness was finally being considered at QMH from 20th August 2020, there was only an informal telephone advice available, the quality of which varied with the person who took the call, and anything further required the transfer of Mrs Leaver back to SGH by LAS to A&E. I understand that the NHS South West London Integrated Care Board declined to provide formal psychiatric cover to QMH, neither formal telephone advise nor staff on site to see patients. In evidence this was identified as a lacuna in the service provision at QMH, by all the clinicians with whom it was discussed, such that for the last 10 years psychiatric liaison has been providing informal telephone advice without the need for the patient to be transferred back to A&E at SGH. The Health Information Exchange viewer, ( HIE) available to doctors with in St Georges Hospital Trust at the time, contained a GP summary which did not contain the recent overdose or CMHT treatment as part of the active problem summary, nor even depression as a diagnosis despite a relapsing and remitting history of depression and anxiety going back to 2006. HIE did contain sections of her RIO notes (psychiatric records) which appear to have been missed and details of attendence with suicidal ideation at Kingston 19th July 2020, which also appears to have been missed or disregarded by the clinicians. Senior doctors in evidence were not aware of the information on the HIE. Instead the incomplete past medical history which listed anxiety and dementia appears to have taken at face value. As above, severe agitation at SGH did not prompt a reconsideration, neither did tearfulness and low mood at QMH. Concerned phone calls from family were not logged nor passed to clinicians until she expressed active suicidality, and no doctor returned a call to the family until the daughter insisted on the 22""d August 2020 that if no doctor called her back to discuss her concerns about her mother she would attend the hospital despite the pandemic. By then it was all too late. The lack of psychiatric history taking deprived Mrs Leaver of the opportunity for psychiatric liaison opinion and risk assessment that would have been likely to have discovered medication she had secreted in her bag that she subsequently consumed to lethal effect. This was despite the fact that for at least 2 out of the three days that she was at SGH from 15th to 18th Auaust 2020, she was found bv nursina staff ta lack full mental caoacitv. I understand that considerable training has now been given on this issue so that patients who lack capacity may have their belongings searched to identify and secure dangerous items such as medication. There were also concerns that her suicidality may have been exacerbated by drug interactions between phenytoin and diazepam. These matters have been addressed by SGH in the training of its clinicians. Matters of Concern 1. That the GP summary did not contain pertinent psychiatric history that would have assisted the hospital clinicians to identify Mrs Leaver's depression and specifically her suicidality. 2, That doctors at SGH do not take a reasonable psychiatric history as part of their clerking and thus fail to make a proper holistic assessment of the patient and potentially miss the opportunity to manage risks such as those in this case which may lead to death. 3, That doctors at SGH need training on the information available on HIE and how to access it. 4. That NHS South West London Integrated Care Board has made no formal provision for psychiatric liaison cover at QMH, despite there being such a clear clinical need for this that the team from psychiatric liaison have felt compelled to provide informal telephone advice for the last 10 years. 5. That the lack of formal psychiatric advice availability at QMH puts vulnerable patients at increased risk, since the only way to properly access such advice is for them to be sent by LAS ambulance to A&E at SGH, when they are physically frail, given that QMH is a rehabilitation unit. 5 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action. It is for each addressee to respond to matters relevant to them. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

NHS England","Samuel Thomas Howes On 17th September 2020, the Senior Coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Samuel Thomas Howes. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 th March 2023. Medical Cause of Death 1a Multiple Traumatic Injuries How, when and where and, for investigations where section 5(2) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 applies, in what circumstances the deceased came by his or her death. Shortly after 9am on 2 September 2020, Samuel Thomas Howes suffered fatal injuries when he jumped in front of a train [REDACTED] He did so in the following circumstances: a) Samuel suffered from ongoing mental health issues including anxiety and depression. b) Samuel's mental health led to his use of drugs and dependency which exacerbated his poor mental health. c) Samuel was a looked-after child, living in a placement residence. d) That he was free to, and did, leave that residence e) That early on 2 September 2020, he was recorded by police as being a 'missing person' f) That police did not succeed in finding him before he jumped in front of the train Below are also matters admitted by interested persons: a) Following Samuel's arrest on 30 August 2023, neither of the safeguarding forms (specifically, a CYP and a DASH form) was completed by officers of the British Transport Police (BTP) b) The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) did not request Samuel be assessed by healthcare professionals (in particular a Custody Nurse Practitioner or a member of the Liaison and Diversion Team) while in custody on 30-31 August 2020. c) The MPS did not progress the investigation to locate Samuel after 3:15pm on 2 September 2020 and before actions were set at 08:04am on 2 September 2020.","A jury found: Suicide Samuel's mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death. We believe that the following matters also possibly made more than minimal, trivial or negligible contributions to his death a) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the possibility of a rehabilitative placement. There were inadequate provisions for Samuel's complex needs. In particular, it was noted that no alternative treatments were proactively pursued. The agencies identified Covid as an obstacle to justify their inadequate responses. b) The failure to inadequately share risk information by Social Services and/or Mental Health Services with each other, and with the police. A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Missing risk assessments were not completed consistently • The Grab Pack was not completed • iii) Samuel's vulnerabilities and suicide notes were not adequately communicated to the police by Social Services c) The sharing of risk information by the MPS and/or BTP with partner agencies. A number of factors were noted in this regard: • There was a failure to share risk information by the MPS with BTP, as well as with partner agencies. • In particular, there was a failure to complete and update the CYP Fonns, or Merlin, as a result of each agency using their own platfonn. • In addition, the BTP did not access the PNC to identify Samuel's Warning Markers d) Steps taken by the MPS to seek an assessment of Samuel's mental health by a Liaison and Diversion Practitioner whilst he was in custody on 30 and 31 August 2020 The following was noted in this regard: • Actions noted on THRIVE regarding the provision of a mental health assessment for Samuel were not followed up on multiple occasions. e) The inadequate approach of staff and the safeguarding processes within Croydon Custody Suite A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Samuel's actions were regarded as 'attention-seeking'. • The DASH and CYP Fonns were not completed. • The limited collaboration between the MPS and BTP led to a lack of recognition of Samuel's mental health needs, resulting in inadequate care. f) Failures by multiple agencies and the inadequate response to the 'missing persons' investigation conducted by the MPS A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Failure to share infonnation by different agencies • Failure by multiple agencies to contact Samuel's family when he went missing. g) Samuel's interactions with his girlfriends The following was noted in this regard: • Samuel's relationships were described as 'chaotic' and this impacted on his mental health and his behaviour • In particular, the texts from his girlfriends telling him to 'kill himself as well as the threats by another girlfriend to end her life, had a significant impact on Samuel's behaviour.","During the course of the investigation, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN (some of which overlap) are as follows:

(1) Samuel's case should be a stimulus for some level of Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service reflection on how different Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service teams are organised and work together.

(2) The delayed response of the Adult Complex Additions Service to referral and issues related to provision of care to adolescents presenting with mental health vulnerabilities and substance use difficulties.

(3) The lack of a complex service providing, to adolescents, treatment for both substance misuse and mental health issues models, in terms of willingness to engage, being problematic for some young people.

(4) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the provision of a rehabilitative placement.

(5) Samuel's mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 10 October 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows: Eric Sebastian Huber was known to suffer with his mental health and was considered to be vulnerable. On 1 April 2021 Mr Huber was discovered deceased hanging [REDACTED]. He died due to self-inflicted suspension Eric Sebastian Huber died as a consequence of his own actions.,"Mr Huber had a long history of drug and alcohol use dating back to 2005. – he also had a long history of depression and anxiety. He had been managed intermittently by the community mental health services. Mr Huber was considered vulnerable and at risk of exploitation and harm from others – he was known to the safeguarding team at Devon County Council (DCC) and the safeguarding team at Devon and Cornwall Police. His vulnerability was felt to be due to alcohol, chronic mental health problems general self-neglect and to his ongoing misuse of drugs and risk of “cuckooing” from convicted drug dealers. In October 2019 a safeguarding enquiry was commenced and allocated to a case worker at DCC to follow up with a visit to establish their views and risks and discuss with the police. The case worker spoke with police officer who had seen Mr Huber that day – the officer reported that Mr Huber was fine, he was attending AA meetings regularly and coping much better – the case worker did not follow up directly with Mr Huber and did not assess Mr Huber. In September 2020 there was a further safeguarding concern raised to DCC by the police as his flat was being used to sell drugs by two individuals staying there – an activity known as cuckooing. The police requested a review of Mr Huber's care and support needs. On 13 October 2020 this was allocated to the same caseworker as previously. On 18 October 2020 Further concerns were raised with DCC around 2 individuals intimidating Mr Huber. There is no written record in the DCC care first record system of action taken by the case worker in response to these concerns. From the records it appears that there is no evidence of a Care Act assessment, multi-agency discussion meeting or consideration or Mr Huber's situation and how to manage the risk from drug dealers at this stage. On 24 November 2020 Mr Huber himself called the DCC Adult Social Care Direct via its call centre to ask for support – there is no record of this message being followed up by the team manager or the social worker. On 3 December 2020 a friend of Mr Huber rang DCC Adult Social Care Direct to raise concerns over cuckooing and bullying of Mr Huber and that he was struggling to cope. The case worker called Mr Huber on 7 December 2020 and discussed help with his drug and alcohol use and enabler assist to help with household matters – the case worker noted that he would contact the police for an update. There is no record of a call to the police. On 8 December 2020 the safeguarding enquiry was closed with the outcome that the immediate risks were adequately addressed and that it was a proportionate response to reallocate for a full assessment of needs. There is no record of that full assessment taking place. On 15 January 2021 a police report was received by Devon Adult Social Care Direct call-centre there are no records of any contacts or discussions arising from this police contact. The case was closed on 3 March 2021 – at this time there had been no assessment of his needs.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) The evidence shows that there were opportunities to engage with Mr Huber and fully assess his risk and needs, these were not taken; in addition, multi-agency and multi-disciplinary discussions to consider Mr Huber's situation and how organisations could work together to address the concerns and risks were not conducted. 3 6"

The investigation concluded on the 24th November 2021 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a hanging,"Michelle Louise Jennings had a history of contact with mental health services and had a history of indicating suicidal ideation to a number of agencies. She was assessed as being suitable for step 4 therapy. However at the time of the assessment of her need there was a 2 year waiting list to access therapy. On the balance of probabilities this delay possibly contributed to her death. On 11th April 2019, 17th July 2019, 28th July 2019, 17th January 2020 and 8th May 2020 she was dealt with by British Transport Police (BTP) and indicated suicidal thoughts. Following the incident on 8th May 2020 BTP prosecuted her for obstructing the railways when she had indicated she had suicidal ideation at the time she was on the railway. She was subsequently arrested on a warrant and held in custody before being sentenced. On the balance of probabilities this decision to prosecute possibly contributed to the deterioration in her mental health and her subsequent death. On 1st August 2020 following calls to the mental health crisis line she was referred for a mental health assessment by the Primary Care Mental Health Team (PCMHT) part of Cheshire & Wirral partnership NHS Trust (CWP). On 3rd September 2020 she was assessed by telephone by the PCMHT and then the case was referred to the PCMHT MDT. On 6th September she rang Cheshire Police from Delamere Forrest with suicidal thoughts. She was taken to Hospital and discharged the following day. On 9th September 2020 her case was considered by the PCMHT MDT. They determined her needs were too complex for the PCMHT and she was to be referred to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) part of CWP. The referral was not made until 16th September 2020. At the point of referral she was discharged from the PCMHT caseload. On 17th September 2020 she presented at Stepping Hill Hospital with suicidal thoughts. She was assessed by mental health services and discharged. On 23rd September 2020 she was discussed at the CMHT MDT where the referral was rejected and she was to be referred back to the PCMHT. She was discharged from the CMHT caseload at that point. She was no longer on the caseload of either the PCMHT or the CMHT. Despite the complexity of her needs and her deteriorating mental health there was no discussion between the PCMHT and the CMHT in relation as to how to manage or mitigate the risk at this point although it was documented that she felt rejected by mental health services. On the balance of probabilities the poor communication between the PCMHT and the CMHT, the failure to assess risk effectively to ensure she remained on the caseload of either the PCMHT or the CMHT probably contributed to the further decline in her mental health and her death. On 3rd October 2020 she made her way [REDACTED] and hanged herself [REDACTED] She was found on 5th October 2020.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest heard evidence that the backlogs for therapy were such that the waiting list at the time she was assessed as being appropriate for step 4 therapy had a two year wait time. Since that time the waiting period had not decreased and was now between 2 -3 years in both primary and secondary care. This was due to a shortage of trained therapists and demands on the service and was a national issue not specific to the CWP trust. 2. The inquest was told that the trust had since Michelle's death recognised that the lack of ownership created through the application of its referral and discharge policy internally carried an unacceptable risk. Significant changes had been made. However it was unclear if nationally the lesson had been shared and that other mental health trusts had taken similar steps. 3. The evidence before the inquest was that there needed to be a clear understanding by all prosecuting authorities of the impact of a prosecution on someone with a complex mental health background such as Michelle. In Michelle's case the BTP file reviewer (the nature of the offence Michelle faced meant that it was not a CPS lawyer who made the charging decision) had not correctly applied the public interest test and had not considered the mental health/vulnerability of Michelle Jennings as required to. As a consequence a decision was taken to prosecute her without an assessment of the impact on Michelle and her case was dealt 3 with by the Magistrates Court without them being given the full background in relation to her deteriorating mental health. BTP are as a consequence of Michelle's death taking steps to address how their prosecution teams should deal with the public interest test and gather information where mental health is an issue. However there is no clear mechanism for such learning and changes (to reduce the risk to life) in relation to vulnerable people such as Michelle to be implemented within the other 42 Police Forces in England and Wales or within other agencies responsible for prosecuting criminal offences. 6

Chief Executive East London NHS Foundation Trust Trust Headquarters 9 Alie Street London E1 8DE 1,"On 25 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Freeda Glausiusz, aged 32 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday. I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide whilst suffering a psychotic episode.",Freeda Glausiusz jumped from her [REDACTED] home on 15 May 2021. Her father had called the crisis line in desperation the day before. His call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved. It is unclear whether any alternative action by the crisis team would have changed the outcome.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that made to the crisis line the day before his daughter died. The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks during the conversation; did not listen to ; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis. In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter's mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled. The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively. I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts. • This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line. • Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz's death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper. • When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance. 3 2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroner's officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because told my officer about it. • I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest. • I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest. • I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month. • I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest. • I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief. • Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August. This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths. And it does not demonstrate respect for the family of the deceased. 6"

He did note, however, that the matter had ostensibly been dealt with as a high-risk response for some time prior to its re-categorisation at that level. I was not able to conclude that the delay in raising the level of risk to high had been causative of the death as it was not known at what time had, in fact, hanged himself. It had to be noted that there was a period of approximately eight hours before he was first reported to police as a missing person. It was accepted in evidence that the decision as to the appropriate level of risk was essentially a ""judgement call"" on the part of the individual officer. It was further accepted that there would be occasions when these judgements would be very finely balanced. It was not felt that there had been any failure to follow practice or protocol at a local level. It was noted, however, that it would be sensible to share the salient facts with you in order that there could be a proper review of the guidance contained within the relevant College of Policing APP upon which the police officers relied. It was recognised that if the guidance could be clearer this may assist different officers from achieving a greater level of consistency in decision- making when faced with the same, complex set of facts. 2 Information Classification: CONFIDENTIAL 6"

She was in contact with mental health services up until the evening of the 30 th April 2018 before she killed herself the next morning.,"On the evidence various issues were addressed and set out in the coroner's determination and findings and can be referred to for wider reading. Two specific issues arose which could not be said to have caused or contributed to death but could in others. 1 Delay in IAPT counselling a) After turned 18 she moved to adult mental health services. She had parallel contact with her GP surgery . Shortly before 18th birthday, according to the MPFT clinical review (page 9 of 33), was referred to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) by the Access Team for assessment for psychological therapy or counselling. On the 14th November 2017 (page 12 of 33) it was agreed with to add her to her GP surgery waiting list for counselling in line with her treatment preference. remained on the IAPT waiting list for counselling at the time of her death. b) The evidence at the inquest was that a 3 month time interval would be optimal but in case, in relation to this GP surgery, 10 months would be the norm. Such a delay is sub-optimal and could have an adverse effect on a 2 patient waiting for counselling to commence. 2. Risk assessment and progress notes. a) The electronic records were hard for a lay person to follow or understand particularly when said to have been updated or validated with the potential for original entries to have been overwritten (as opposed to amended or deleted). If the user of the system understands it then that does not make it unfit for purpose but it was not clear how a user would readily see what had originally been written. b) This is distinct from progress notes and/or risk assessments being accurately recorded. It was not clear when and how often risk assessments should be updated and how and when they would be read in conjunction with the progress notes. Were risk assessments intended to be summaries if a user did not have time to read all the progress notes? What function were they intended to serve? Consideration should be given as to whether the system can be improved. 6"

Her Majesty's Senior Coroner for the City of Brighton & Hove Assistant Coroners CATHARINE PALMER LL.B (HONS) GILVA D.J.TISSHAW, BA(LA W)HONS THE CORONER'S OFFICE WOODY ALE, LEWES ROAD BRIGHTON BN23QB Telephone: Brighton (01273) 292046 Fax: Brighton (01273) 292047 involved in face to face meetings with Daniel and help him when he was struggling to get his work in on time and to deal with his academic pressures. In the circumstances I heard that if work was late a penalty would be imposed. This seems ridiculous; why hit a man when he is already down? (2) With regard to communication - this appeared to be deeply flawed amongst the huge number of University departments and units. The health clinic incorporating amongst other things a pharmacy and the counselling service, was excellent offering free access to students. The system failed - Daniel was not in the link between his GP/counsellor and the student support unit. If this link had been complete I do not believe Daniel would have died when he did."
