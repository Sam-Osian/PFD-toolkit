An inquest into Mr Bradley's death was opened on 28 th July 2023 and his inquest was heard before me on 19 th May 2025. The medical cause of Mr Bradley's death was: 1a. Pressure on the neck 1b. Hanging It was discovered in toxicology testing that the level of Venlafaxine in his blood was around twenty times that expected from a therapeutic dose and in the range associated with fatality. A narrative conclusion was given: “Dean Bradley hanged himself on the morning of 15 th October 2021 in [REDACTED], Stockton on Tees whilst under the influence of excess amount of prescribed medication. The police failed to contact the mental health services when they assisted him at Thornaby station earlier in the day and failed to adequately relay details of his mental health crisis to staff at the hostel. The staff at the hostel failed to respond to information provided by the police. There were missed opportunities by both Cleveland Police and the hostel to involve mental health professionals and secure appropriate mental health support for Dean.”","At approximately 0300 on 15 th October 2021 Mr Bradley was found by the police walking on a dual carriageway. Following a discussion in which he revealed he was homeless the police secured emergency overnight housing for him at a hostel. There were no concerns for Mr Bradley's mental health at that point. Mr Bradley was seen outside the hostel at 0450 and was met by the security officer. He spoke of people being after him. He was reassured and taken back to his flat. Mr Bradley left the hostel unwitnessed by the security officer. At 0540 a member of the public came across Mr Bradley sat on a bridge over a railway line. Mr Bradley stated he intended to kill himself. The member of the public spoke with Mr Bradley and called the police. During his time with the member of the public Mr Bradley moved himself as if to jump in front of a train when he thought a train was coming. The police attended. The police succeeded in bringing Mr Bradley down from the bridge and spoke with him in the police van. The officers came to the conclusion that Mr Bradley was under the influence of drugs. One of the officers raised concerns about Mr Bradley's mental health as he was expressing persecutory beliefs and appeared paranoid and delusional. He believed that people were chasing him and wanted to kill him. The police considered contacting the Crisis Team and other mental health services but did not do so. The main reason for this is that, in their shared experience, the mental health services would tell them to safeguard Mr Bradley until he was sufficiently sober to be assessed. The police returned Mr Bradley to the hostel and, with the assistance of the security officer, Mr Bradley was shown CCTV of the premises. The purpose of showing Mr Bradley the CCTV was to prove no one was chasing him. Mr Bradley reportedly relaxed and accepted that no one was pursuing him. The police determined that the risk of suicide and self-harm had lessened and that it was safe and appropriate to leave Mr Bradley at the hostel. The police did not adequately relay the circumstances in which they found Mr Bradley to the security officer at the hostel. There was a brief comment that he was found sitting on the edge of a bridge at the station. The security officer did not enquire further. The security officer saw Mr Bradley leave his flat at approx. 0720. Mr Bradley refers to people being after him again. The security officer met with Mr Bradley, reassured him and took him back to his flat. Staff from the hostel knocked on Mr Bradley's door at approx. 1015 as he had not left the flat. There was no response. Police attended and Mr Bradley as found deceased, hanging in his flat. The staff from the hostel were clear that the hostel was not a place for a person suffering from a mental health crisis. Residents are not checked upon, it is a service which provides accommodation only. Evidence was received from a Detective Chief Inspector who concurred. He also gave evidence as to Right Care Right Person initiative. He spoke of Crisis Cafes and Calming Centres in other regions where people who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol and present with metal health concerns may be supervised pending a mental health assessment. There appears to be a gap in the services available for people in this category. The officer spoke of a discussion with Middlesbrough County Council about provision of such a service. I stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Bradley's death and the unavailability of this resource. Neither the local authorities in this jurisdiction, the Integrated Care Board (NHS North East & North Cumbria), Tees Esk and Wear Valley NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust nor the Department of Health were Interested Persons in the inquest. They did not give evidence at the inquest as the concerns raised did not come to light until the hearing.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 This document was classified as: OFFICIAL The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1) Current resources for safeguarding those with mental health illnesses whilst intoxicated may be placing people at risk. 2) I heard evidence that a person who was suicidal, suffering with mental health concerns and was intoxicated could not be adequately safeguarded until he was sufficiently sober to allow a mental health assessment. 6",0,N/A: Not found

I found the cause of death to be: 1(a) Respiratory failure 1(b) Aspiration pneumonia 1(c) Choking episode II Fractured neck of femur (operated on 28.4.24) Coronary artery atherosclerosis.","I returned the following in box 4 of the Record of Inquest recorded: Mr Keith Ineson resided at the Glenroyd Care Home, 164 Whitegate Drive, Blackpool, FY3 9HF. It was known that Mr Ineson was at risk of suffering from falls and required an altered diet. On 26 April 2024, Mr Ineson was in the process of mobilising when he suffered an unwitnessed fall. The carer in attendance had left the room and upon their return, Mr Ineson was found on the floor. On 27 April 2024, Mr Ineson was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where he underwent a right hemiarthroplasty. On 3 May 2024, and following the right hip hemiarthroplasty surgery, Mr Ineson suffered a choking episode on food. Mr Ineson developed aspiration pneumonia and, despite treatment, Mr Inseon's condition deteriorated and he died on 6 May 2024 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Mr Keith Ineson was a resident at the Glenroyd Care Home from 6 June 2019. It was known to the Glenroyd Care Home that Mr Inseon was a high falls risk, and measures had been put in place to address this issue. Following the fall on 26 Aril 2024, I found that the senior carer who checked Mr Ineson for signs of injury had conducted an appropriate assessment. It was noted in the evidence, that the observation scores taken for Mr Ineson following his fall had not all been recorded in Mr Ineson's care notes. This left a gap in the evidence as to reviewing the need for escalation to medical services after the fall. I received from witnesses who gave evidence before me, helpful assistance concerning several issues about learning and changes that had been made following Mr Ineson's death. I could not identify changes to the record keeping system though, and as such found that the issue around the absence of recording observation scores following a fall gave rise to a risk of further death. This was because the record keeping was inaccurate, contained gaps in the information, and engaged my duty under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 6",81,N/A: Not found

A forensic autopsy was conducted on 17 February 2024, and an investigation into the death was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest between 13 and 15 May 2025. The medical cause of death was 1a cold water immersion. A narrative conclusion of the inquest was that: Paul Andrew Alexander had a long-standing history of mental illness since December 1989. In July 2022 a consultant psychiatrist following review changed his primary diagnosis to paranoid schizophrenia with a secondary diagnosis of mental and behavioural disturbance due to the use of cannabinoids. At the time of his death, he received oral medication of Haloperidol 8 mg per day. On 4 February 2024 at 00.12 hours a call was made to police expressing concerns for Paul's welfare. Under the Right Care Right Person framework, the call was redirected to the ambulance service who did not attend as they did not have a location for Paul. No emergency services were dispatched. This represented a missed opportunity. However, it is not possible to determine whether Paul's death would have been avoided given the likelihood is that his death occurred shortly after entering the water at Aspley Marina at around 04.43 hours on 4 February 2024.","As identified above, Paul Alexander had a long-standing history of mental illness. At the time of his death, he was under the care of community mental health services who visited him regularly to monitor his compliance with taking his oral medication. The last contact prior to his death was on 29 January 2024 when his care coordinator visited Paul. No concerns were reported or noted. His care coordinator left Paul with a month's supply of Haloperidol. On 4 February 2024 at 00.12 hours a call was made to the police by a member of the public expressing concerns for Paul's welfare. Under the Right Care Right persons framework (RCRP) the call was redirected to the ambulance service who did not attend as the caller was unable to provide them with a location (contrary to information provided to the police in the initial call). The call was redirected back to the police. The caller became frustrated with being passed between the emergency services and terminated the call. No attempt was made to contact the caller again. As such no emergency services were dispatched. Subsequently, on 6 and 7 February 2024, following further calls to the police Paul was identified as a missing person, initially as a medium risk and then a high risk. On 14 February 2024, a body was discovered in the water at Aspley Marina, Huddersfield. This was subsequently identified as Paul. In the ensuing police investigation CCTV last identified Paul as being alive at around 04.43 hours on 4 February 2024 when he was seen running across a car park and down a flight of stairs towards the marina. He was not being chased and was observed on the CCTV to be behaving bizarrely. The conclusion was that he entered the water in the marina at that time and died as a consequence of cold-water immersion.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) In the course of the evidence, it became apparent the police had introduced RCRP in September 2023. RCRP is a police initiative arising out of a national agreement but to be implemented by individual police forces. Little or no consultation with other agencies had taken place prior to the implementation of RCRP in September 2023.Whilst I heard evidence that meetings with other agencies now do take place, the specifics of Paul's case and the broader issues it raises have not been discussed nor is there any understanding/ agreement in place as to how such a situation would now be addressed. As much as the court was advised was that if a similar situation arose today, there may be a discussion between operational managers in the respective police and ambulance call centres, but that this would be reliant upon the matter being brought to the attention of those respective managers by the call taker. The evidence from the RCRP lead at the ambulance service indicated the scenario that arose with Paul was not an isolated example. As such there appears to be a lacuna in how emergency services will respond to such a situation when it was accepted this was a call expressing concern for Paul's welfare. 6",65,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 May 2025 with a conclusion of natural causes.","Abdirahman Afrah began to suffer from chest pain, associated with a cough, from the very early hours of the 3 June 2024. At around 2330 on the 3 June 2024 he attended Newham University Hospital A&E, on the direction of a NHS 111 clinical adviser. He notified the triage nurse of severe chest pain including pain radiating to the left arm and shoulder. He had a tachycardia of 130 beats per minute, but other vital signs were normal. An ECG was carried out which showed a sinus tachycardia and P pulmonale. Venous blood gases showed an abnormal base excess, indicating a compensated metabolic acidosis. Abdirahman was given two lots of painkillers whilst in the A&E department, but his pain continued to be severe. After around 3 hours of waiting, Abdirahman asked to lie down due to his level of pain. He was told that there were no beds available and that he would have to wait a further 4 hours or so. He notified the nurse that he would have to leave, to be able to lie down to relieve the pain. The nurse advised him that he could leave. He was not seen by a doctor before leaving the department. A doctor from A&E called him the following afternoon to tell him to return to the A&E department for a doctor to explain the results of the tests. He raised concerns about the waiting times and said that he was seeing his GP later the same afternoon. The importance of returning to hospital was not explained clearly to him. Abdirahman did attend his GP practice at around 1630 on 4 June 2024. He was seen by a physician's associate who did not have the hospital results available to her. Abdirahman was clinically stable at the consultation. He was advised by the physician's associate to return to the emergency department to discuss his results. It is unlikely that he was advised to return with any sense of urgency. At around 8pm on the 4 June 2024, Abdirahman suffered a collapse in his home address. Emergency services were called and he was urgently conveyed back to Newham University Hospital. Sadly, all life-saving efforts at this time were unsuccessful. Abdirahman's life was pronounced extinct at Newham University Hospital at 2145 on 4 June 2024. Abdirahman died as a result of bleeding caused by a pulmonary vascular malformation. There was a missed opportunity to provide further investigations and treatment to him when he attended hospital on the late evening of the 3 June 2024. The evidence did not however reveal that such investigation and treatment would, on the balance of probabilities, have prevented his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The inquest heard that waiting times to be seen in Majors A&E at Newham University Hospital could sometimes be between 9 to 14 hours. Many patients are unable to tolerate such long waits and leave the department before being seen. 2. There was no timely triage of Majors patients by the medical team, to ensure that those with the greatest potential of clinical decline are picked up quickly and appropriate investigations commenced at an early stage. Without such frontloading of care, patients like Abdirahman who might compensate right up to the point of collapse, might be missed again. 3. When the doctor called Abdirahman the following afternoon, she did not have all of the relevant clinical information to hand. She was not aware of the compensated metabolic acidosis. It is unlikely that she advised Abdirahman of the importance of returning to the hospital. It is foreseeable that patients may be reticent to return to A&E, because of the lengthy waits, so doctors making the call to patients who have left, should be fully informed about the clinical condition and risks. The risk of not returning should be made very clear. 4. Abdirahman was 17 years old. He declined to return to A&E. There was no direct discussion with a responsible parent about the need to return to A&E. 5. When Abdirahman stated that he would be seeing his GP later that afternoon, he asked for the relevant results to be sent to the GP. Neither the results, nor the discharge summary were sent to the GP in time for the appointment. The inquest heard that the A&E doctor did not know how to share such information with the GP. 3 6",17,N/A: Not found

Deputy Chief Constable , Durham Constabulary 2. Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing, 1","On 7 January 2025 an investigation into the death of Sophie Ann Louise Cotton, 24 was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical cause of death being pressure on the neck due to hanging.","The Deceased had a long history of mental health problems. These came to the fore in late 2024. The Deceased was under the care of mental health services both in the community and, for a short period of time, as a voluntary in-patient on a psychiatric ward. On 6 January 2025 the Deceased was due to attend an important meeting and when she did not turn up for that meeting there was serious concern for her welfare. Four calls were made to the police that day to request that they attend the Deceased's home address to check on her welfare. However, due to the “Right Care, Right Person” assessment, the police refused to attend. The first call was made by a social worker at 15:46, expressing concerns that: 1. The Deceased had not attended family contact with her children, which was very out of the ordinary. 2. There was no reply at the Deceased's home address, but the Deceased's dog was present inside. 3. The Deceased's phone was switched off. 4. None of the Deceased's family had a key to the property. 5. The Deceased had a history of mental health problems and had attempted suicide on numerous occasions. The “Right Care Right Person” decision was no. The social worker was advised by the call handler to ring the ambulance service. The call handler also said that they would speak to their supervisor for the decision to be reviewed. The second call was made by the Deceased's mother at 16:38. The call was made on the 999 number. The call handler asked the Deceased's mother if the Deceased had made a threat of suicide today and when the Deceased's mother said that she hadn't, the call handler advised the Deceased's mother to call back on 101. It was acknowledged at the inquest that it was not best practice to have asked the caller to call back on 101. The third call was made by the Deceased's mother (on the 101 number) at 16:44, expressing concerns that: 1. The Deceased had a history of mental ill-health and suicide attempts. 2. The Deceased was mean to attend family contact time that day and hadn't. The Deceased never missed family contact time. 3. No one had spoken to the Deceased since Saturday (4 January 2025). 4. Family had attended the house and the Deceased was not answering the door, but the dog was inside and the Deceased would not usually leave the dog alone for that long. 5. The same lights had been on in the property since Saturday (4 January 2025) and the deceased did not usually leave the lights on., 6. A chewed up teddy bear could be seen on the living room floor and the Deceased would not normally leave a chewed up teddy bear on the floor for fear that it would choke the dog. 7. The Deceased's phone was going straight to voicemail. 8. To the direct question of was there a real an immediate risk to the Deceased's life the Deceased's mother said yes, because the police have had to cut the deceased down before from previous suicide attempts. 9. The Deceased's mother informed the call handler of the police also attending suicide attempts at the train lines. 10. The Deceased had recently been reading court papers, which can cause her to spiral downwards. 11. The Deceased had previously attempted suicide with no warning The “Right Care Right Person” decision was no. The Deceased's mother was advised to call the Mental health Crisis team or NHS 111. The Deceased's mother said that the social worker had already contacted mental health services and that the social worker had advised the Deceased's mother to call the police to see if they could do a welfare check. The call handler said that the “Right Care, Right Person” decision was still no, but the decision would be reviewed by supervision. The fourth call was made by a social worker at 16:57, expressing concerns that: 1. The Deceased was vulnerable and over the past six months had attempted to end her life many times. 2. The Deceased was due to attend family contact time and had not turned up and she would never miss family contact time and this was really concerning. 3. The family had attended the Deceased's address and the dog was barking inside, but there was no sign of the Deceased. 4. The lack of contact was unusual, as often the Deceased would cry out for help and contact the Crisis team. 5. The police had had to break the door down previously to get in to cut the deceased down. The call handler said that she could not confirm if a welfare check would be done. Very shortly after this the Deceased's family forced entry into the Deceased's home address, and found the Deceased hanging by a ligature [REDACTED].","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) During the 16:44 call, by following the “Right Care, Right Person” procedure there was a refusal to the request that the police attend, even when a family member was expressing the view that there was a real and immediate risk to life. (2) During the 16:44 call the “Right Care, Right Person” advice to contact mental health services appears to have disregarded the fact that the mental health crisis team do not have the power to enter locked premises and so would require police attendance to facilitate entry to the premises. (3) During the 16:57 call there was no decision for police to attend, even though this was the third caller (and second professional caller) that had expressed serious concerns 3 about the Deceased. (4) Although there is a procedure in place to have a negative “Right Care, Right Person” decision reviewed by a supervisor, this causes additional delay in circumstances when attendance could be extremely time-sensitive. 6",24,N/A: Not found

Although the jury did not comment on this specifically, it seemed to me from the evidence in court that there was not a consistent expectation among police officers of how long it generally takes a police controller to make a decision on authorisation of a pursuit. Whilst I do not suggest there should be a time limit on this, it would seem helpful if the expectation of the timing of police control decision making were to be roughly aligned between those making the decisions (in the police control room) and those waiting for the decisions (in police cars involved in the pursuits). 6",18,N/A: Not found

Obviously this omission did not have an impact upon Lewis Johnson's death, but it did have an impact upon the inquest. It meant that the jury had no clear objective evidence about the distance between his motor cycle and the police car behind. Given that learning and at times policy are informed by such findings, it appears that this would be helpful to include in future investigations when death follows a police pursuit. 6",18,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 14 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was an open inquest, as the cause of Mr Fraser's death was unascertained.","Mr. Fraser was a 37-year-old gentleman who had suffered from schizophrenia, hypothyroidism and misuse of alcohol. He required admission to a mental health hospital under a section of the Mental Health Act from 20 February 2024 to 18 March 2024. On discharge, he received very regular input from the Home Treatment Team until 9 May 2024, when he was transferred to the Mental Health & Wellbeing Team. There was no clear care plan in place whilst he was under the care of the Mental Health & Wellbeing Team. A new Care Co-Ordinator was allocated on the 5 June 2024. This Care Co-Ordinator met with Mr. Fraser on only one occasion (19 June 2024). Mr Fraser did not converse with the care co-ordinator at this time, so a meaningful risk assessment could not be completed. The last recorded contact with Mr. Fraser by the NHS services was an administrative call on the 9 July 2024. Family last had contact with him on the 8 July 2024. Visits were made by the mental health and wellbeing team on 16 July 2024, 22 July 2024 and the 24 July 2024 but there was no response. The family were informed that Mr. Fraser was “denying entry”. The team did not make it clear to the family that they had received no response at all from Mr. Fraser – either to home visits or telephone calls. The mental health team did not notify the family that a friend had also raised concerns about a lack of contact with Mr Fraser on the 18 July 2024. When a further failed visit occurred on the 29 July 2024, the mental health and wellbeing team requested that the family assist them in gaining access to Mr. Fraser. Mr. Fraser's sister attended his home address and found him clearly deceased within the premises. A paramedic attended and pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. A post-mortem examination was carried out. Despite a post-mortem examination, which included specialist tests for toxicology and neuropathology, a cause of death could not be identified. The pathologist considered that Mr. Fraser had likely passed away a few weeks before he was found. There was a lack of clear risk assessment, risk management and care planning by the Mental Health and Wellbeing Team, but it is not possible to reach a conclusion about the causal effect of this, as both the date when Mr Fraser passed away and the cause of death are unascertained.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) There was no clear and documented care plan in place whilst Mr Fraser was under the care of the Mental Health and Wellness Team. There was a lack of structure to the care provided to Mr Fraser by the Mental Health and Wellness Team. (2) There was no robust risk assessment carried out by the Mental Health and Wellness team. (3) The Mental Health and Wellness Team had been unable to reach Mr Fraser from the 16 July 2024. On the 18 July 2024 a friend contacted the mental health team to raise concern about his lack of contact with Mr Fraser. No action was taken at this time to review the risk of harm to Mr Fraser or to determine whether the Trust's missing person procedure should be activated.

A narrative conclusion was recorded with the cause of death as:- 1a Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy Etta Lili Stockwell-Parry was born at 40+13 gestational weeks on 3 July 2023 at 00:51 at Ysbyty Gwynedd in poor condition following an instrumental assisted birth. Etta was transferred later that day to Arrowe Park Hospital, Liverpool for specialist neonatal support where she passed away on 7 July 2023 as a result of inutero compromise which led to the condition from which she died. There were several opportunities not taken by those caring for Etta's mother antenatally including at 40+1 gestational weeks and at 40+5 gestational weeks and at 40+12 gestational weeks to escalate from a midwife to a registrar due to static growth which would have led to induction of labour and likely safe delivery of Etta. There were opportunities to identify concerns with Etta through her mother on the midwifery led unit on 2 July 2023 including properly conducting holistic assessments, properly completing partogram and manual palpation of maternal pulse which would also likely have resulted in earlier detection of distress and successful delivery. Etta's death was contributed to by neglect.","The circumstances of the death are as follows :- Etta was born in poor condition at Ysbyty Gwynedd on 3 July 2023 where her Mother's pregnancy was uneventful up until 21 June 2023 (40+1 gestational weeks). Static growth had not been identified by the community midwife at this time and therefore there was no referral to obstetrics. The static growth was not identified for a second time at 40+5 gestational weeks on 25 June 2023. Again, there was no referral to obstetrics. When Etta's mother was 40+12, on 2 July, she arrived at the Maternity Outpatient Assessment Unit for induction of labour. It was not noted that there was static growth. She ought to have been referred to the labour ward for close monitoring. Instead, she was induced. She received intermittent monitoring. The holistic assessments were not always completed and not entirely complete, the partogram did not note baseline fetal heart rate only as required, the maternal pulse was not always taken and recorded and there was no recognition that Etta's mother's pulse was being recorded as opposed to the fetal heart rate. There were several gross failures identified in Etta's mother's care which resulted in opportunities not taken to deliver Etta before she became distressed. Etta was transferred to Arrowe Park Hospital for specialist neonatal care where she passed away 4 days later. There were many incidences of learning from a neonatal perspective relating to Etta's resuscitation at Ysbyty Gwynedd.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows – The maternity and neonatal departments undertook an investigation into Etta's mother's care antenatally and after Etta's delivery. The concerns are as follows:- a. The neonatal investigation was not thorough. The investigator did not obtain or request statements from doctors directly involved in Etta's resuscitation, nor did they meet with them to understand what had occurred. The investigation was based on records alone. The records themselves, identified as part of the investigation, were often incomplete or included retrospective entries. Despite this, the investigator nor the panel involved considered speaking to or obtaining statements from crucial individuals. Coroner's Office, Shirehall Street, Caernarfon b. There was no sufficiently full contextual sharing of the investigation or its findings from a neonatal or maternity perspective. Some witnesses had only received and read the report several weeks prior to the Inquest. c. The memoranda sent to staff highlighting the learning did not include context or narrative around the circumstances of investigation. Therefore, those not directly involved would not have been fully aware of the context of what had occurred. Having issued Reports to the Health Board regarding quality of investigation previously, this concern remains. Specifically, I have concerns that the neonatal element of the investigation was not thorough enough such that without this genuine learning and change will not and cannot occur. Even where learning has been shared, I am concerned that this is not contextualised sufficiently. I am also concerned that staff not involved in the incident will not learn fully enough from events where there is inadequate sharing of learning from an incident. 6",0,N/A: Not found

Mr Smith died by hanging [REDACTED]. It is more likely than not that he intended the consequences of his action to result in his own death. Mr Smith had recent contact and intervention from mental health services and was known to be at risk of suicide due to a deterioration in his mental health presentation over the preceding weeks. Mental heath services did not inform Mr Smith's wife of the extent of his suicidal ideations. Mr Smith had indicated that he would inform his wife of his raised suicidal ideations but did not do so. On balance, it cannot be said that if such information had been provided, Mr Smith's suicide would have been prevented. Conclusion: Suicide","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. The guidance provided to clinicians and nursing staff within the mental health services as to when information and sharing and information gathering was to be undertaken with, and from, family members and how such decisions are to be recorded on the standard forms lacked clarity, particularly as regards the distinction between information sharing and information gathering. Such guidance being of relevance when a patient has given consent for information sharing and gathering to take place and when, and in what circumstances, such steps would be taken. 2. The information leaflet provided to patients lacked sufficient detail of the approach taken by mental health services on the issue of information sharing and information gathering so that patients could readily understand the difference between the two and understand when the need for information sharing and/or gathering could arise and what steps would be taken by mental health services. 6",0,N/A: Not found

He was seen post operatively to develop lymphoedema which is a recognised complication of the surgery. He was referred for treatment of the lymphedema. This amongst other treatments required the wearing of compression garments. At an assessment of his lymphoedema on 3rd January 2024 his right thigh was seen to be swollen. On examination the compression garment was not located in a way that applied pressure to his right thigh. He displayed no symptoms suggestive of a deep vein thrombosis including pain. It is not possible on the evidence to say if a deep vein thrombosis was present at that time. On 5th January 2024 after complaining of pain in his right thigh he collapsed and died.

Her death was also contributed to by malnutrition. The medical cause of death was: 1a) Lower Gastro-intestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia 1b) Aortic Stenosis 2. Ischaemic heart disease with recent stent placement. Malnutrition.,"Marina Waldron was admitted to hospital on 17/12/2023 with evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Despite receiving all appropriate treatment the gastrointestinal bleeding, caused by angiodysplasia, an uncommon complication of aortic stenosis, proved overwhelming and MW died on 15/2/2024.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: - During the 8 ½ weeks of MW's hospital admission, her nutritional needs were poorly considered or managed. Examples of this include: 1. An ongoing failure to heed the family's concerns that from admission to hospital, MW was not eating or drinking adequately 2. A failure to formally monitor MW's dietary intake 3. A failure to respond to a low Albumin level which is a sign of malnutrition 4.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 May 2025. The medical cause of death was found as follows 1a Frailty Syndrome 1b Progressive Deconditioning following Recurrent Admissions for Pelvic Collections 1c Laparoscopic Pan Proctocolectomy and Ileostomy (3/9/2023) The four questions – who, when, where and how – were answered as follows … David Arthur Sharp BATEMAN died on 22 July 2024 at Pengover House Care Home Liskeard Cornwall from recognised complications following an elective operation, namely a Laparoscopic Pan Proctocolectomy and Ileostomy performed at University Hospital Plymouth on 3 September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows David Arthur Sharp BATEMAN died as a result of recognised complications of an elective operation.","Dave opted for an elective surgical procedure due to high-risk cancerous colon polyps which had developed following a lengthy period of ulcerative colitis. The surgery was performed on 3 September 2023 at Derriford University Hospital Plymouth (UHP) and was uneventful. However, following that initial procedure, Dave suffered significant post operative complications which required multiple admissions to Derriford and interventions/treatments for a pelvic collection and urethral injury. Dave had a final operation to try and deal with these complications on 24 December 2023. It was found that before the operation on 3 September 2023 that Dave was fit, active and relatively healthy. However, by 24 December 2023 Dave had physically deconditioned and developed significant cognitive impairment. It was found that Dave's deconditioning led to the development of dementia such that he was no longer able to care for himself and had entered a period of irreversible decline after the final operation on 24 December 2023, that led to his death from frailty syndrome on 22 July 2024. The court found evidence of poor nursing care on Derriford UHP Wolf Ward, particularly during the immediate post-operative period, from 3 September to 24 December. The poor nursing care contributed to Dave's deconditioning in the following: – Ineffective support for taking nutrition, leading to significant weight loss. The medical records indicated that Dave's weight dropped from 86 kilos on 7.9.23, down to 64.8 kilos on 2 Dec 2023, amounting to approximately 25% weight loss – Insufficient monitoring of weight – Inadequate physiotherapy – Repeatedly found to be lying in a soiled bed – Frequently in an unwashed condition – Frequently with a split stoma bag The court found on the basis of evidence from the hospital's treating consultant that this poor care and treatment from September to December 2023 amounted to a missed opportunity to rehabilitate Dave following the operation. The treating consultant stated that such poor care raised a mortality risk for other patients. There were three witnesses from UHP giving evidence before the court, a consultant and two nursing witnesses. They were unable to assist the court upon whether these issues of poor care have been addressed.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. The finding of poor nursing care and treatment that was possibly causative of Dave's death and the evidence of the treating consultant that such poor care raised a mortality risk for other patients. 2.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 7 th May 2025, having been heard on 24 th , 25 th and the 26 th March and the 6 th and 7 th May 2025. Emmy Russo was delivered by category 1 caesarean section at Princess Alexandra Hospital at 21:30 on the 9 th January 2024. Emmy's mother had arrived at the hospital in labour earlier that day, having been booked in for an induction at 41+4 weeks. Her evidence was that she had refused earlier induction having not been provided with full information on the risks of proceeding with pregnancy and having been encouraged by the midwives to labour naturally. At 13:45 Emmy's mother's membranes ruptured. Meconium was suspected but no speculum examination was done to confirm. At 15:10 meconium was confirmed. Emmy's mother was started on a CTG trace and transferred to the labour ward, but no doctor's review took place although the witnesses agreed that one was indicated at this time. The CTG which started at 15:36 was never normal, with indications of hypoxia throughout (showing a lack of cycling and no accelerations throughout, and a shallow deceleration at 16:31). No full holistic review with a doctor took place although Emmy's mother's midwife believed she had requested one shortly after 17:10. Prolonged decelerations occurred at 18:12, 19:47 and from 20:55 onwards. Doctors' reviews occurred at 18:30 and 18:55, but confirmed that labour should proceed. Reviews by a doctor were indicated at 19:30 and at 19:47, but no review was requested (although there was a senior midwife review following the 19:47 deceleration). A doctor's review was requested at around 21:00 and a decision to proceed to category 1 caesarean section was made at 21:13. Emmy Russo was born in a very poor condition at 21:30. There were a number of missed opportunities to have delivered Emmy sooner, particularly at the review at 18:30. The evidence was that had a decision been made to deliver her at or before 19:30, her death would probably have been avoidable and had a decision been made to deliver her between 19:30 and 20:55, it is possible that her death would have been avoidable. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative as follows: The deceased died as a result of an acute hypoxic brain injury sustained shortly before birth. The medical cause of death was given as: 1(a) Severe Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy 1(b) Placental Dysfunction","Post-dates baby born at Princess Alexandra Hospital following a hypoxic injury in the period shortly prior to birth, leading to severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Emmy was born in a very poor condition. She was resuscitated and transferred to Addenbrookes' Hospital for ongoing intensive care on 10 th January, at less than 12 hours of life. At Addenbrookes', treatment was carried out to support Emmy's organs, including treatment for meconium aspiration syndrome. Her organs recovered quickly, however scans indicated a severe hypoxic ischaemic brain injury. Emmy's care was reoriented towards palliative care and she was extubated at 21:55 on the 12 th January 2024. Her death was confirmed within an hour.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) (1) The evidence of the current information given to patients at 40 weeks' pregnant on the decision over whether to accept the offer of an induction from 41 weeks does not reflect NICE guidance on the information needed by patients to make an informed choice on induction. Whilst it provides details of the risks associated with induction, it does not provide information on the risks of continuing with pregnancy beyond 41 weeks. (2) The evidence given at inquest indicated a lack of understanding and/or consistency over when concerns about labouring mothers and/or the CTG trace should be escalated for doctor review. Evidence was given on the measures put in place to address issues with escalation, including “Teach or Treat” and “AID” tools, however, there was limited evidence that these are understood by the working midwives and/or advertised to them by way of regular reminders. 6",0,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Natural Causes. Box 3 of the Record of Inquest read: John Charles Spencer died on 21 May 2024. Mr Spencer had become unwell on 17 May 2024, insofar as having diarrhoea and vomiting, after eating fish and chips. On 20 May 2024, he had a telephone and a subsequent an in-person consultation with a GP out of hours surgery. Mr Spencer's past medical history included a right inguinal hernia repair in December 2010. That information was not available on the computer system being used by the GP out of hours surgery and it was not mentioned by Mr Spencer in consultation. The clinical diagnosis, consistent with his presentation, was gastroenteritis and safety net advice was given. Mr Spencer was discharged and found deceased at his home address, [REDACTED], the next day. There were no suspicious circumstances and there was no third party involvement. His medical cause of death was recorded as: 1a Diffuse purulent peritonitis. 1b Small intestine perforation. 1c Recurrent inguinal hernia with obstruction.","Mr Spencer became unwell four days before his death, on 17 May 2024. He was suffering symptoms that were later diagnosed, after a telephone and an in-person consultation on 20 May 2024, as gastroenteritis. When Mr Spencer was assessed by the GP out of hours surgery, including an examination of his abdomen, he had made no complaint in relation to hernia issues. The examination of his abdomen was considered to be consistent with the diagnosis given. In 2010, some 13 and a half years earlier, Mr Spencer had suffered from a right inguinal hernia. This was recorded in his GP medical history. The GP medical history was not available to the GP out of hours surgery. The post-mortem examination report stated that, in the opinion of the Consultant Histopathologist, Mr Spencer died due to a purulent peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity) secondary to a bowel perforation (rupture). That was caused by a section of the small bowel getting stuck and becoming obstructed within a right inguinal hernia, increasing the pressure within the bowel. Mr Spencer sadly died the day after the consultation, on 21 May 2024.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The GP medical history summary, populated by the GP that a patient is registered to, is not always accessible to a GP out of hours surgery. Evidence was given that there are various reasons for this, including the patient not providing consent for the exchange of this information. However, on some occasions, even when a patient has consented, the patient record systems utilised by the GP registered practice and the GP out of hours surgery, insofar as being different computer systems or for whatever other technological reason, prevented the exchange of information into the GP out of hours surgery. In this case, evidence was heard that the GP practice was using the EMIS system and that the urgent treatment centre (GP out of hours surgery) was using SystmOne. That fact caused the GP out of hours surgery to not be able to access Mr Spencer's GP medical summary. This situation generates a concern that, providing the patient has consented, key medical information may not be conveyed to the GP out of hours surgery which should be accessible to allow the appropriate exchange of medical information to inform what examinations should take place in an out of hours setting. This concern is particularly significant in circumstances where the patient does not say and/or present with the points in the medical history relevant to the GPs determination about what further examinations should occur flowing from the medical history of the patient. 6",82,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was; Her death was a consequence of a serious underlying blood cancer which progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia contributed to by sepsis due to prolonged immunosuppression, a failed first stem cell transplant caused by a failure to undertake appropriate testing on the donor and recipient before transplant and a subsequent Stem cell transplant.","Mrs Doig was diagnosed with myelodysplasia (a rare blood cancer) in September 2023. She had an aggressive haematological condition with high-risk features and was at risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia. The normal treatment for this condition is a stem cell transplant (SCT) which was to be sourced as soon as possible given the risk of progression of her disease. She was initially treated with chemotherapy and her condition went into remission. Mrs Doig had an unusual HLA type which was highly sensitised with many HLA antibodies. This meant any transfusion or SCT needed to be carefully tested to ensure it was suitable for Mrs Doig. Initial attempts were made to identify an unrelated stem cell donor but unfortunately one could not be found. As a result Mrs Doig's 2 sons were tested for haploidentical donors. As the SCT was coming from a son it would always be only a 50% match. It was determined that one of her sons was a suitable donor. During the testing undertaken on her son no virtual crossmatch comparing the donors HLA antibody profile to Mrs Doig's HLA type was undertaken despite it being known that Mrs Doig had an unusual HLA type with many HLA antibodies. This was due to a failure to appreciate the significance of this testing for Mrs Doig, a communication failure between the hospital and the transfusion service, no additional sample being sent for Mrs Doig and no MDT being undertaken to discuss the treatment being proposed, thus losing the opportunity to discuss existing donor specific antibodies and the risk of SCT graft failure. Mrs Doig was admitted to hospital for pre transplant conditioning on 27/03/24 and received a SCT from on 04/04/24 to which she had an extreme reaction. By 25/04/24 the SCT had not engrafted and further checks were done which identified that there were specific antibodies present which explained the failure of the SCT. Mrs Doig remained in hospital and was treated for infection until she was well enough to be discharged home on 31/05/24. An umbilical cord donor was identified, and Mrs Doig was admitted to hospital on 13/06/24 for pre transplant conditioning before she received a double umbilical cord transplant on 29/06/24. Post transplant Mrs Doig had low grade fevers and raised inflammatory markers and was treated for bacteraemia. Mrs Doig deteriorated on 31/07/24 and was treated for atypical respiratory infection. She was admitted to ITU on 06/08/24 and it was confirmed that the SCT had grafted on 07/08/24. Whilst on ITU she was treated for chest sepsis and developing multi organ failure and had PV bleeding. She remained very unwell and had two cardiac arrests on 14th and 16th August. She sadly passed away later than day. Tests taken during the last days of her life confirmed that sadly her underlying condition had progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia which was untreatable. Based on information from the Deceased's treating clinicians the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Multiple organ failure 1b Sepsis due to immunosuppression from stem cell transplants 1c myelodysplasia progressing to acute myeloid leukaemia 1d II failed first stem cell transplant and subsequent second stem cell transplant","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The conclusion of the inquest was that: Mrs Bushell was a pillion passenger on a motorcycle being driven by her husband, when at just before 1.20pm on 9th September 2023 they were struck by a car which failed to stop at the junction on Stapleford Road and entered the carriageway of the A606. Mrs Bushell was thrown from the motorbike and came to rest on the road, sustaining fatal injuries. She was taken as an emergency to Queens Medical Centre Nottingham where she sadly died that same day. There were multiple missed opportunities to identify a significant risk to road users during a period of resurfacing work. At the time of the collision, there was no advanced warning of white line removal at the junction and the permanent “Give Way” sign was not visible. As a result, the driver of the car which struck Mrs Bushell had not identified the junction and failed to stop. The cause of death was established as: I a Chest and Abdominal Injuries I b I c II","The driver of a car which struck the motorbike on which Mrs Bushell was travelling, did not identify the junction ahead and was given very little opportunity to do so. The words “SLOW” were painted on the road 70 metres prior to the junction. There were permanent centre white lines/warning lines painted on the road commencing approximately 60 metres from the junction. Neither of these hazard warnings alerted the driver to the junction ahead. The topography gave the impression that the road continued ahead. A temporary sign with a red background and white writing displaying the words “No road markings at junction” was in situ at the junction and attached to the base of the permanent Give Way sign, this permanent sign was leaning over and obscured by foliage. The permanent white lines at the junction had all been removed including some of the centre/warning lines. There was inadequate signage on the road to assist the driver in identifying the approaching junction. There is no evidence that the driver was distracted prior to the collision. He was using the Waze satellite navigation application on his phone and whilst I am not critical of its use or design, it contributed to the impression that there was no junction ahead. There were multiple missed opportunities to identify that there was a significant risk to road users during a period of resurfacing work particularly from 4th September to 9th September 2023. Despite numerous dynamic risk assessments over these six days, it was not identified that the permanent Give Way sign was obscured by vegetation. No drive or walk through along the road had been conducted which would have afforded the four traffic marshals and their supervisor a drivers view of the junction and highlighted the associated risks. A witness gave evidence on behalf of Leicestershire County Council (LCC) and accepted that they are responsible for the signage at this junction. LCC also accepted that there were missed opportunities to identify that the permanent Give Way sign was obscured. Reference was made to The Road Traffic Regulations and the Traffic Signs Manual and it remains the view of LCC that the single temporary sign in place on the road was appropriate and complied with the guidance. It was accepted however that the processes that existed at the time of the collision required review and more robust and specific written risk assessments are now in place locally together with more comprehensive training for those involved in traffic management, using the circumstances of this collision as a learning and retraining exercise. Further suggestions made by the police in court including giving consideration to additional temporary warning signs well ahead of the junction, the introduction of a lower temporary speed limit and introduction of a drive or walk through of the approach to the area from a road users' perspective and these will be included in a new written risk assessment.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: I indicated at the conclusion of the inquest that I will not be making a report in respect of the missed opportunities identified in relation to Leicestershire County Council employees. Significant changes have been made. I am however concerned that in respect of the national regulations, I am told that the temporary signage installed at the collision site was compliant with the guidance. Reference was made to The Road Traffic Regulations and the Traffic Signs Manual and it remains the view of LCC that the single temporary sign in place on the road was appropriate and complied with the guidance. It was nevertheless inadequate. I refer specifically to Chapter 16 paragraph 20 of the Coroners Bench Book, ”Where the identified risk to life has already been ameliorated by local changes the coroner may wish to consider whether the matter is an issue that only affects the relevant local organisation or is a wider or national issue. In the latter case then directing a report to a national, professional or regulatory body might enable them to also consider relevant changes that might protect lives.” I conclude that this is potentially a Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 wider national issue and I am writing to you, as you have responsibility for ensuring the transport network is safe and I wish to highlight the issues raised during this investigation and at the inquest particularly in relation to the current regulations with regard to temporary signage. 6",56,N/A: Not found

On 3rd March 2025 I concluded the Inquest. At the time of her death Rose was 12 years of age. The medical cause of death given was: 1a Colonic Gangrene and Aspiration Pneumonia 1b. Caecal Volvulus 2. Mosaic Trisomy 17 I found: On the 29th January 2024 Rose Annie Harfleet accompanied by her mother attended the Emergency Department of the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, after Rose had a sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting earlier that morning on a background of chronic intermittent constipation. From birth Rose was diagnosed with mosaic trisomy 17Q with global developmental delay. During her admission Rose vomited green bile indicative of intestinal obstruction which was confirmed on an abdominal x-ray undertaken at 18.32 and informally reported at or around 19.45 hours that evening. A plan was made to contact the surgical team at St George's Hospital as the tertiary referral centre and to transfer Rose for further assessment and management. This was not facilitated. Instead, Rose was transferred to the children's ward at the hospital on or around midnight and treated for constipation in the absence of a surgical review and without appropriate observations or monitoring and a lack of understanding that this was a time critical intestinal obstruction with bilious vomiting. There was a failure of the medical and nursing staff to appreciate Rose was clinically deteriorating. Rose had a cardiorespiratory arrest at 06.15 hours. Resuscitation was unsuccessful and Rose was recognised to have died at the hospital at 07.48 hours on 30th January 2024. An autopsy confirmed the abdominal pain, and clinical deterioration was due to a caecal volvulus causing intestinal obstruction and bowel ischaemia. If the transfer had been facilitated as initially planned curative surgery would have been undertaken and Rose's death would have been prevented.",Please see my findings above,"1. The management of children with profound disabilities within a hospital setting Rose was a deeply loved child who brought great joy to her mother, wider family and all that knew her. During the inquest hearing no national or local guidance was forthcoming to assist medical and nursing staff, within a conventional hospital setting, to appropriately manage patients such as Rose who had a global developmental delay and was wholly reliant on her mother to advocate on her behalf. This gives rise to a concern that this omission adversely impacts the care that patients such as Rose receive. 2. Guidelines - consultation with parents and guardians of children with profound disabilities within a hospital setting Rose's mother was devoted to Rose and was very able to advocate on Rose's behalf as well as being best placed to provide the vital information about her signs and symptoms given Rose was unable to do this for herself. The importance of obtaining this information was not understood by the paediatric consultant who took no history from Rose's mother and underestimated the severity of her signs and symptoms. The consequence of this was that Rose's voice – through her mother as her advocate – was not heard and she was not therefore able to actively participate in the care and management that was provided to Rose, the corollary of which resulted in poor clinical decisions which contributed to Rose's death. This gives rise to a concern that by not listening to parents or guardians as a matter of course leads to discrimination of disabled children. 3. Nursing and Medical care on the ward In the absence of local and national guidelines, the importance of listening and responding to Rose's mothers ongoing concerns about her daughter when she was transferred to the ward were not recognised by the nursing and medical staff and consequently not acted upon thereby contributing to Rose's death. There appears to be a prevailing culture that in the absence of a patient being able to explain their symptoms themselves the voice of the parent or guardian is not given the significance it should be for the most vulnerable in a hospital setting. 4. LeDeR Role Rose's admission was during the working week, yet there was no consideration or offer given to Rose or her mother during her time in the Emergency Department to being introduced to a learning Disability Liaison Nurse. This led to Rose's mother being unsupported during this admission or for a nursing professional to be able to liaise and advocate for Rose and her mother with medical and nursing staff in the emergency department. This again gives rise to a concern that patients such as Rose and her mother are adversely impacted on the care that they receive in the absence of local and national guidelines that this should be routinely available and offered as a matter of course.",12,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Margaret Kagure Pauline Reece died on 7 March 2023 at [REDACTED], Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex having been found hanging at her home address.","Margaret Kagure Pauline Reece attended her GP on 13 February 2023 in a state of extreme distress reporting suicidal ideation without intent. Due to her distress her GP prescribed her 2mgs PRN Diazepam in the form of 12 tablets which would last her for 2 days at the maximum dosage. The GP also issued a deferred prescription for collection on 16 February of the same amount. Her GP at that time referred her for a mental health assessment by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The Court heard that it was the GP's intention that Mrs Reece would be seen by the Mental Health services prior to the end of the Diazepam prescription. On 17 February 2023 Mrs Reece was seen by the Mental Health Team who were concerned about her use of Diazepam due to its risk of dependency and as such decided that she should be weaned from Diazepam and started on an increasing dose of Quetiapine. A GP Medication Letter was handwritten by the Associate Specialist that and sent to the GP which detailed the actions which the Doctor had determined should be taken by the GP to achieve the titration of medication for Mrs Reece. This was not received by the GP surgery and no explanation can be provided as to why this was. This was the only document which detailed the role which the GP was beingasked to perform in relation to the reduction of the Diazepam. A letter was also sent by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust on the same day to the GP with the outcome of the assessment of Mrs Reece which was received. This detailed that there was a plan for the reduction of Diazepam and introduction of Quetiapine but no information was given as to how this should be done or what was expected of the GP in that process. This letter was received by the GP on 18 February 2023. The GP in their evidence stated that they assumed that Mrs Reece had been given instructions as to how to reduce the Diazepam. Mrs Reece requested further Diazepam from the GP on 21 February. The GP was aware of the letter from Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and as such gave a limited prescription of 2mgs Diazepam which, if taken at maximum dose, amounted to a further 2 days. Mrs Reece was sent a text by the GP requesting that she make an appointment to check on her titration of Diazepam in 2 weeks' time. On 28 February 2023 Mrs Reece was seen by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and found to be in withdrawal from Diazepam having last taken Diazepam on 24 February when she ran out. She had contacted 111 over that weekend to obtain a prescription but had been unable to do so. She was issued with a prescription for Diazepam by the Psychiatrist that day. This was a prescription for the doses which had been set in the GP Medication Letter of 17 February 2023 to titrate Mrs Reece's medications. In the course of the evidence, the Court heard that whilst Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust have access to Plexus and thus a limited amount of information from the GP surgeries there is no reciprocal arrangement in place so as to enable GPs to understand the prescriptions which have been issued for their patients or to check that they have instructions on medications which they are or are not supervising for the Mental Health Services. The Court heard that the NHS England project for sharing of information was in progress but in the interim, and no date was given as to when this would be completed, the position remains as it was at the time that Mrs Reece died.",During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are that in the absence of information being made available to the GP there is a risk that patients will not receive any medication or receive excessive amounts of medication due to the risk of duplicitous prescribing.

The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard by me on 29 and 30 April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was 'accident'. The medical cause of death was: 1a urosepsis 1b long-term catheter following traumatic spinal injury (August 2024)","Mr Ian Simpson fell in August 2024 sustaining a traumatic spinal injury as a result. He required a long-term catheter which increases the risk of urine infections. Due to his complex care needs, Mr Simpson was admitted to Magnolia Court Care Home, Hampstead (Barchester Healthcare). At about 09:30 on 16 December 2024, Mr Simpson was found unresponsive by care staff and there was a delay in calling an ambulance. He was conveyed to the Royal Free Hospital and found to be suffering from sepsis, secondary to urine infection. Despite treatment, Mr Simpson continued to deteriorate, and he died in the hospital that evening. The delay in calling an ambulance did not cause or more than minimally contribute to Mr Simpson's death.","During the course of my investigation and the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are, as follows: 1. Mr Simpson was found unresponsive by care home staff at about 09:30 on 16 December 2024, and an emergency ambulance was not called until 10:19. On the evidence in this particular case, that delay did not more than minimally contribute to death; however, it would or should have been obvious to staff that the resident was very unwell and required an ambulance as soon as possible. This raises the concern that such a delay, if repeated, places others at serious risk. My concern was compounded by the evidence from the manager (which I did not wholly accept) that it would be reasonable to take this period of time for a nurse to be alerted, assess the resident, and decide whether an ambulance was required. 2. The notes from the care home were considered in great detail during the inquest, particularly the care notes from the morning of 16 December 2024. These raised significant concern about their adequacy and accuracy. While the deficiencies in record-keeping did not cause or contribute to death in the specific circumstances of this case, I am mindful of the importance of clear and accurate record- keeping to the delivery of safe and effective care more widely. The issues included: • an entry that was plainly not correct and therefore gave a misleading impression of interactions that staff had with Mr Simpson at or about the time of his being found unresponsive; • an entry suggesting that Mr Simpson was 'awake and lying in bed', when he had already been found unresponsive some time earlier, suggesting that the entry was either retrospective (and not labelled as such) or simply incorrect; • a series of notes, likely to have been retrospective but not labelled as such, giving a misleading impression of the course of events that morning. While I was provided with some evidence that action had been taken in relation to this matter (such as an audit of records), I found that the evidence provided insufficient reassurance that the risk was sufficiently reduced. 6",81,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 April 2025. The medical cause of death was found to be as follows: 1a Pulmonary Embolus 1b Deep Vein Thrombosis 1c Fall and Fractured Neck of Femur II Dementia The four questions – who, when, where and how – were answered as follows: James Frederick SMITH died on 25 June 2024 at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro Cornwall from complications whilst in the operating theatre following trauma consistent with a fall on 22 June 2024, contributed to by a total ambulance delay of 17 hours and 52 minutes. The ambulance delay comprised a response delay of 12 hours and 8 minutes. During that time Jim suffered a long lie on the floor with a fractured hip, overnight 22nd into 23rd June 2024. Jim then suffered a handover delay of 5 hours and 42 minutes, waiting in the ambulance for that time before being admitted to the hospital emergency department. The ambulance delay is likely to have contributed to Jim developing a deep vein thrombosis, a complication which led to his death on the operating table. The medical team had decided to operate due to Jim's severely critical condition and were aware of the deep vein thrombosis but there was no realistic alternative to an operation. The ambulance delay was attributable to a systemic failure related to the whole system of health and social care. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows: Jim died whilst undergoing necessary surgery following trauma consistent with a witnessed fall and long lie. Jim's death was contributed to by an ambulance delay which was attributable to a systemic failure related to the whole system of health and social care. The ambulance delay was possibly causative of Jim's death in that it likely contributed to the pre-operative complications which led to Jim's death on the operating table.","1. The findings of fact on how Jim died are set out above in the answers to the four statutory questions. 2. The court made findings of fact upon the wider circumstances, namely the systemic failure that was possibly causative of Jim's death. Significant handover delays 3. At the time of Jim's 999 call, 22 June 2024, the South West Ambulance Service (SWAST) reported multiple ambulance crews were stacking at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro (RCHT). There were no ambulances or Community First Responders (CFRs) available to respond. 4. In Jim's case the unavailability of ambulance resources meant that he spent 12 hours on the floor waiting for an ambulance, unable to move due to a fractured hip. 5. On arrival at RCHT, Jim spent a further 5 hours and 42 minutes waiting to be admitted to the emergency department. 6. The court noted that the national target is for ambulances to handover patients to hospital is within 15 minutes of arrival. 7. On 22 June 2024, there were over 473 hours of ambulance time lost to handovers that were over the 15 minute target at the three hospitals servicing Cornish patients, namely RCHT, Plymouth Derriford Hospital, and Barnstaple North Devon District Hospital (NDDH). This is equivalent to approximately 43 double crewed ambulance shifts lost to delays (based on a standard 11 hour shift). At RCHT on that day, the average handover time per patient was three hours. 8. On 23 June 2024, there were over 551 hours of ambulance time lost to handovers that were over the 15 minute target at RCHT, Derriford Hospital, and NDDH. This is equivalent to approximately double crewed ambulance shifts lost to delays (based on a standard 11 hour shift). At RCHT on that day, the average handover time per patient was, two hours, 42 minutes. 9. Data indicates the picture has not improved. Significant average handover delays at RCHT were recorded for every month of 2025 to date. This is a picture reflected across the southwest and indeed nationally. 10. The average handover delays conceal spikes such as that which led to the long delay in this case. Such long delays increase the risk of mortality. 11. The court heard evidence of a new policy being implemented by SWAST to try and reduce ambulance resources being tied down in lengthy waits at hospital. After a 90-minute handover delay the ambulance paramedics will provide notice to ED that a patient is being left on a trolley, notwithstanding the fact that ED has not formally accepted that patient, and despite evidence of concerns around ED crowding. Emergency department crowding 12. On the day of Jim's ambulance delay, RCHT ED was at 140% occupancy. ED accommodated these patients on trolleys in corridors, and the rest of the patients would either be seated within the waiting room or remain inside ambulances outside. 13. The situation had not improved at the time of a data request from HM Coroner. The date of the request was 16 January 2025, on which date ED was recorded to be at 150% occupancy. 14. EDs have a national target for 95% of patients to be admitted, transferred or discharged within 4 hours. It was noted that there is a recent major study which shows that the standardised mortality rate starts to rise from 5 hours after the patient's time of arrival at the ED and they concluded that after 6–8 hours, there is one extra death for every 82 patients delayed. This increased mortality is partly attributed to the fact that patients in ED are not receiving the surgery or specialist care that is available on the wards. 15. The court found that on 22 June 2024 the hospital failed to meet the 4-hour target for a significant number of patients. 16. Recent data indicated there has been no significant improvement on meeting the 4- hour target, with RCHT ED failing to meet that target for a significant number of patients. Insufficient social care provision 17. The court found there was insufficient bed availability on acute wards which was attributable to significant numbers of patients in hospital with no reason to reside (NCTR), these being patients who are medically optimised but cannot be discharged due to lack of onward care support. 18. On the day of the ambulance delay, 22 June 2024, almost 20% of patients in RCHT were recorded as NCTR. 19. In January 2025 the proportion of NCTR patients had increased to approximately 25% of patients in RCHT. 20. The court noted the main cause for the numbers of NCTR patients was insufficient social care provision, whether commissioned by social services or NHS. 21. Investigations in 2022 and 2023 by SWAST and the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) found a direct link between ambulance delays and inadequate social care provision. The court noted the SWAST systems report which found… ''….there is a direct link between patients waiting in the hospital for discharge to social care and patients being cared for inside ambulances and Emergency Departments.'' 22. Data presented to the court indicated that just over 10% of direct social care posts in Cornwall are currently vacant notwithstanding Cornwall Council securing the agreement of social care providers to pay the living wage. This reflects the national picture of just under 10% nationwide vacant direct social care posts. 23. The court noted that the NHS does not carry responsibility for the recruitment and retention of social care staff or any broad obligation to promote the social care market. 24. The HSIB report referred to the fact that the organisations immediately required to deal with ambulance delays are ambulance trusts and acute hospitals, In Cornwall that is SWAST and RCHT. These organisations do not have control over the services primarily responsible for ambulance delays, namely social care provision and support. They are unable to influence the whole-system and therefore carry risks that they cannot wholly mitigate or manage. 25. The court noted the HSSIB report which states that delayed discharges (and consequent ambulance delays) are a national issue which is attributed to a whole system failure of health and social care. The court noted the HSSIB investigation's first safety recommendation is an urgent 'whole system' response to reduce patient harm.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Insufficient social care provision leading to large numbers of patients in hospital who are otherwise fit for discharge, thereby impeding patient flow through hospital, there being a direct link between inadequate social care provision and ambulance delays. (2) Significant handover delays at RCHT and other southwest hospitals leading to ambulance resources being tied up with increased response delays and increased mortality risks for patients in the community waiting for emergency ambulances. (3) ED crowding leading to increased risk in mortality for patients being held in ambulances and corridors and being delayed from receiving surgery or specialist treatment on wards. 6",82,N/A: Not found

""Kenneth Martin Robert Foster died in hospital on 25th November 2024 due to pneumonia caused by the aspiration of stomach content during a seizure. Mr Foster suffered from epilepsy caused by a traumatic brain injury sustained in 2012. Mr Foster was admitted to hospital on 3rd September 2024 due to seizures. Mr Fosters seizure activity was managed through a number of anti-convulsant medications, seizure activity was not observed for 5 weeks. On 11th November 2024 Mr Foster removed a naso-gastric tube used for feeding and the administration of clobazam an anti-convulsant. The removal of the tube led to an interruption in the administration of clobazam for 13 hours. The same day Mr Foster suffered a resumption of seizure activity, he was later diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia which ultimately led to his death.""

Mr Foster's medical cause of death was determined as;

1a Aspiration pneumonia
1b Status Epilepticus
1c Complex partial seizures
1d Traumatic brain injury 2012 L fronto-parietal subdural subarachnoid haemorrhage and temporal bone fracture","Kenneth Foster sustained a head injury in 2012 which caused a stroke. Mr Foster suffered from epilepsy thereafter.

On 14th September he had recovered sufficiently to be stepped down to ward-based care and through a series of medications sustained a five-week period without a seizure.

On 1st November 2024 Mr Foster removed a naso-gastric tube used for feeding and the administration of clobazam - an anti-convulsant. The reinsertion of the naso-gastric tube was delayed for eleven hours. During this period no thought was given to administering clobazam in a different manner. A total interruption in the administration of clobazam lasted for for 13 hours.

Staff at his supported accommodation missed an opportunity to report their concerns about Mr Reeves during a telephone call from mental health staff on 27 March 2024. This did not make a material contribution to Mr Reeves' subsequent death. Having used unknown drugs / psychoactive substances in the early morning of 28 March 2024, Mr Reeves crawled out of the supported accommodation building and into the carriageway of the road. While out of the building he ingested mud, some of which he aspirated. Mr Reeves was conveyed to the Royal Free Hospital, where he was found to be critically unwell. His ingestion / aspiration of mud was a significant factor. On 9 April 2024, Mr Reeves became agitated and his clinical situation deteriorated to the extent that he required re-intubation. During re-intubation, he suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite successful re-intubation and extensive attempts at resuscitation, Mr Reeves' death was verified in hospital that afternoon.","During the course of my investigation and the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are, as follows: 1. Maygrove Road, the supported accommodation, is not a care home and there is no expectation that staff at the accommodation will administer or supervise medication. Despite this, staff at the accommodation documented that they had collected Mr Reeves' medication 'for daily supervision'. Staff were aware that it was an expectation, from the mental health unit, that the accommodation staff should supervise Mr Reeves' compliance with his medication. There is no suggestion that the accommodation provider contacted the mental health unit to advise that this was something that they were unable to facilitate. The concerns here are twofold. First, there appeared to be a lack of awareness from staff at Maygrove Road about the nature and extent of what they could/should do to support residents. Second, there was a lack of communication with the treating mental health team. 2. During a welfare check on Mr Reeves on the morning of 26 March 2024, it was noted that Mr Reeves was 'agitated' and that 'there were broken glasses and pulled electrical panel in his flat'. It was also noted that Mr Reeves 'didn't know what had happened'. The mental health unit contacted staff at Maygrove Road on 27 March 2024 and it was accepted in evidence that the concerns about Mr Reeves' behaviour and the damage caused to his flat were not mentioned to the mental health staff. In the circumstances, these matters not having been raised with the mental health staff deprived the mental health team of an opportunity to assess Mr Reeves' mental state and leave status, and to consider whether or not he should have remained on leave. The manager at Maygrove Road told me in evidence that they would not expect staff to raise these matters with the mental health team; something which I found to be 'irrational'. While I found that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that this would have altered the outcome for Mr Reeves, it raises serious concerns about communication that would enable mental health professionals properly to assess the needs and status of patients in the community, particularly given that the accommodation 'generally supports residents with mental health needs'. 3. Although concerns regarding Mr Reeves' presentation (para 2 above) were not raised during the telephone call from mental health staff, the manager of Maygrove Road did send an email to Mr Reeves' care co- ordinator. That email raised health and safety concerns relating to the damage caused by Mr Reeves to his room/flat. However, it did contain phrases such as, 'he is not doing well' and he appears 'very unwell'. I found that an email (essentially headed as a health and safety matter) essentially raised concerns about escalation and communication of a deteriorating patient. 4. In the early morning of 28 March 2024 (approximately 07:13), the CCTV footage showed Mr Reeves crawling out of the front entrance to Maygrove Road, initially into the bin area and, a few minutes later, into the road. A support worker from Maygrove Road can be observed walking towards Mr Reeves. However, from the CCTV footage, the support worker appears to make limited attempts, if any, to engage Mr Reeves or block his path into the carriageway of the road. I heard evidence that staff members would not be permitted to restrain Mr Reeves; however, the CCTV footage raises concerns that staff may lack the knowledge, skills or training in handling or attempting de-escalate a situation such as this. For the avoidance of doubt, there was no evidence that an improved response would have altered the outcome for Mr Reeves, but that does not diminish the future risks to others. 6",29,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15th April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was narrative: Died from a biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy when he was incorrectly diagnosed in life with exercise induced asthma and the significance of a witnessed exercise induced syncope episode, and an abnormal ECG were not recognised or actioned appropriately. The medical cause of death was 1a) Biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy",Jake Samuel Lawler was diagnosed by his GP practice with exercise induced asthma and prescribed treatments that did not have any significant impact on his symptoms. On 13th October 2024 Jake collapsed while playing football and had a short period of unconsciousness. He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital by his father. A full history was given that was consistent with an exercise induced syncope. An ECG was carried out. That was abnormal and showed a T wave inversion on lead V5. The clinicians noted there was the T wave inversion but did not recognise that this was a concerning finding from the ECG. The history given by his father was not assessed correctly. The T wave inversion particularly in combination with his collapse should have resulted in him being referred for an inpatient paediatric review and further testing. It is probable that he would not have died on the day he did had the correct actions been taken. Jake's collapse was incorrectly attributed to his exercise induced asthma. He was referred back to the GP for review. He was reviewed by a GP by telephone on 14th October and face to face on 18th October 2024. A FeNO test referral to the asthma nurse was made. On 31st October 2024 the FeNO test was conducted. The asthma nurse referred Jake back to the doctor indicating they did not believe Jake had asthma. There was a plan to refer him to paediatrics. It was clear that the diagnosis of exercise induced asthma being the cause of his collapse on the 13th October 2024 was unlikely and that the working diagnosis within the discharge summary was probably incorrect. The significance of that was impacted by the discharge summary incorrectly describing the ECG as normal. On 5th November 2024 whilst playing football Jake collapsed. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he died at Wythenshawe Hospital on 5th November 2024. The postmortem carried out found he had died as a consequence of having Biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

1. The inquest heard evidence that the significance of 12 lead ECG readings are regularly missed or misunderstood by clinicians which means that key warning signs are missed as in Jake’s case. It is unclear if this is a training issue or the way in which the machines report or volume. Without an improvement there will be further avoidable deaths

2. Jake presented with a clear paediatric exercise induced syncope. The inquest was told that there is no clear national guidance on the pathway to be followed in relation to such children although medical training emphasised that this should be treated as a red flag event.

3. The diagnosis of exercise induced asthma appeared to be based on a history given at the early stages of his breathlessness being reported to the GP and was not revisited even when he was reporting that the classic treatments were not having a significant impact on his symptoms. This was compounded by the exercise induced syncope being incorrectly linked to asthma. In addition, Jake was assessed by his GP practice using the national asthma scoring system. However, the scoring system does not appear to facilitate scoring for exercise induced asthma. In Jake’s case the readings and answers pointed to a well-controlled asthma. This was at variance with the fact that his history indicated that he was continuing to struggle with his breathing when exercising and meant he did not trigger as a concern. This was exacerbated by the normal peak flow readings taken at rest which gave a falsely reassuring picture. A lack of curiosity, a lack of appreciation of the limitations of the national scoring system and a non-holistic approach meant that he continued to be seen as asthmatic when all his symptoms were as a result of his undiagnosed Biventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy

Director of Adult Social Care and Health, London Borough of Croydon 1",On 2 February 2022 inquests were opened into the deaths of: (1) Bernard Cleall and (2) Caroline Cleall. The two inquests were heard together and concluded on 28-29 April 2025. The conclusions of the inquest were that the deaths resulted from an accidental house fire. In each case the medical cause of death was “ Inhalation of smoke ” and the short form Coroner's Conclusion as to death was “ Accident ”.,"The two deceased persons were a husband and wife who died together at home in a house fire in the early evening on 5 January 2022. They were aged in their seventies. The wife, Caroline Cleall, suffered from health issues including limited mobility. She was in receipt of a care package arranged by LB Croydon Adult Social Care following discharge from a hospital admission in September 2021. Before discharge from Croydon University Hospital her needs and her ability to cope in the community had been assessed by an integrated team including representatives of LB Croydon Adult Social Care and an NHS team called “Living Independently For Everyone Services”, known as the LIFE Team. That assessment resulted in a care package of domiciliary visits and the provision of a telecare service managed by LB Croydon under its Careline service. The Careline service decided upon was the basic telecare package involving an alarm call button on a pendant to be worn by Mrs Cleall during the day until going to bed. In the event of a fall or other need to call for help she could press the button and it would send a call to a call operator. On the day of the deaths, Mrs Cleall operated the pendant button but was unable to communicate meaningfully with the call operator as she was stuck in the sitting room of the house where the fire had taken hold (away from the main communication device), and her husband was incapacitated by smoke / fumes. A smoke alarm was sounding in the sitting room but it was not heard by the call operator. The operator caused Careline responders to attend, but the fire brigade were called only once the responders arrived and discovered the fire. By that time it was too late to save the two occupants of the house. The firm view of the fire service is that telecare services should by default be recommended to include the enhanced package option. This includes a smoke detector which, when triggered, sends an urgent signal to the call operator without the need for the client to operate the pendant button. That automated call would result in the fire brigade being notified of an emergency immediately.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The senior manager from LB Croydon Adult Social Care who gave evidence told me that he and his team were unable to access the record of the assessment carried out with Mrs Cleall at Croydon University Hospital for her discharge back to the community. I was told that the record was held by the LIFE team on an NHS system to which LB Croydon Adult Social Care did not have access. (2) The evidence was that that what should take place at that assessment is an adequate risk assessment and a discussion with the client about which level of telecare package is appropriate. If the client declines a more expensive package against advice, this should be documented. There was no evidence in this case of the content of any assessment, discussion or advice as to the appropriate level of telecare package for Mrs Cleall. (3) It appears that LB Croydon's Adult Services would also not have access to the record and the assessment when reviewing the client's situation once the package is in place and underway. 3 (4) A review by LB Croydon Adult Social Care was due 4-6 weeks after hospital discharge but it appears that the reviewers had no access to the assessment, advice and response from the client which took place at the hospital. This would mean that the review was missing vital information which might have had a bearing on whether the telecare package should have been revised to include the enhanced service with an automatic smoke detector facility. (5) In summary, I am concerned that the inability of LB Croydon Adult Social Care professionals to access records of an earlier assessment undertaken (and advice given) by their colleagues, together with the NHS LIFE team, deprives LB Croydon Adult Social Care of the ability to review the client's needs properly (with the necessary information) following discharge into the community. 6",70,N/A: Not found

I recorded the cause of death as: 1a) Aspiration; 1b) Ileus; 1c) Sigmoid volvulus (operated 12/3/23) II) Transient ischaemic attack; hypertension I recorded a Narrative conclusion that Mr England died from natural causes. It is more likely than not that the delays in conveyance to hospital and in definitive medical intervention contributed to the development of a post operative ileus and Mr England's death more than minimally.","Mr England lived in Gloucester. In 2018, a CT at Gloucester Royal Hospital revealed he had a very long redundant sigmoid loop which it was recognised left him very prone to a volvulus. Between February 2020 and February 2023, he had five separate presentations to hospital with a sigmoid volvulus, four of which required medical intervention to resolve. In March 2023, Mr England came to Cornwall on holiday. In the early hours of 12/3/23, he developed abdominal pain with increasing distention. He rang for an ambulance at 01:37 reporting to the call handler that he suspected he had a twisted bowel. Owing to operational pressures, there was delay in the arrival of an ambulance. Mr England arrived at Royal Cornwall Hospital at 08:05. There was delay transferring Mr England from the ambulance and into hospital. An x-ray and CT scan were performed. Both supported a diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus. The CT scan was reported at 10:48 but not brought to the attention of the locum consultant surgeon until approximately 15:30. A rigid sigmoidoscopy was performed at approximately 16:00 but due to concerns over the appearance of the bowel and whether it was ischaemic, a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at approximately 18:00 which confirmed ischaemic/infarcted tissue. A laparotomy was performed at approximately 20:30 when a gangrenous section of bowel was removed and a stoma formed. At a ward round on 15/3/23, Mr England was found to be short of breath and with a distended abdomen. A post-operative ileus was diagnosed and a direction given for a naso-gastric tube to be placed. During the course of its placement, Mr England became distressed and suffered an acute collapse. He could not be resuscitated and died in Royal Cornwall Hospital on 15/3/23.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1) At the time of the initial call to South West Ambulance Service Trust, Mr England reported that he thought he had a 'twisted bowel.' This had happened to him on five previous occasions in Gloucester when medical intervention had been required four times to decompress a sigmoid volvulus. The call handler, using the MDPS system, reached a Category 5 disposition. Two experts who gave evidence at inquest, , a Consultant Surgeon, and , a Consultant Gastroenterologist, both felt Mr England needed to be conveyed to hospital within two hours which I believe would have required a Category 3 disposition. As both the fact of a delay and its causative relevance were admitted by the Trust, the detail of the call and the questions asked to reach a disposition were not enquired into at inquest. Evidence was heard, however, that upon audit it was felt the call handler had achieved a high degree of compliance with expected standards. This raises a concern whether the system is sufficiently nuanced to distinguish between different types of abdominal complaints and to 3 Information Classification: CONTROLLED ensure that those who need to be recognised as a surgical emergency receive a disposition resulting in a patient being conveyed to hospital within an appropriate timeframe. 6",65,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14th April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was narrative: Died from the complications of Lewy Body Dementia and drug induced Parkinsonism contributed to by a prolonged hospital stay when her discharge was not progressed expeditiously. The medical cause of death was 1a) Bilateral pneumonia 1b) Generalised deterioration with reduced mobility and oropharyngeal dysphagia 1c) Lewy body dementia; and Parkinsonism secondary to antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia; and II) Chronic kidney disease; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,Janet Alison Anderson had schizophrenia and was on medication for it. She developed Parkinsonism symptoms as a consequence. She also had Lewy Body Dementia. She was under the care of Greater Manchester Mental Health for her mental health. She was admitted to Manchester Royal Infirmary for a suspected infection from a nursing home and was treated. She was exhibiting Parkinsonism symptoms that were attributed to still being on anti-psychotic medication. A decision was made to keep her on the medication by Greater Manchester Mental Health but was not documented and she was not seen by the team until September 2024. She was medically optimised for discharge from the end of May 2024. She remained in hospital because Greater Manchester Mental Health did not find a suitable discharge placement for her. She did not need to be in an acute setting. The treating clinicians felt the acute setting was detrimental to her health and the prolonged stay contributed to a decline in her health. She began to rapidly decline and had a series of infections that caused her to become increasingly frail. She died on 28th October 2024 at the Manchester Royal Infirmary from bilateral pneumonia.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

1. The inquest heard evidence that the prolonged hospital stay and lack of progress in finding a suitable place in the community significantly contributed to her decline.
She had been suitable for discharge from 20th May and there was no clear strategy to progress her discharge or for the two different trusts to work together to ensure a speedy and safe discharge.
The evidence before the inquest indicated a lack of joined up working between the two trusts that meant that despite the clinical concerns about the impact of her prolonged hospital stay she remained in an acute setting

2. The GMMH documentation was of a poor quality and did not capture key discussions/decisions including in relation to medication. As a consequence, trust staff were not fully sighted on earlier decisions and her needs.

3. The lack of progress in discharge meant that an acute hospital bed was not available to other patients who needed care in an acute setting.",65,N/A: Not found

I reached a narrative conclusion that her death was caused by recognised complications of a necessary surgical procedure","Ms Morgan-Gray was admitted to hospital when concerns were raised regarding the vascular supply in her lower limbs. She underwent surgical procedures to address this. However, she was later admitted to Intensive Care after developing Stercoral Colitis, for which she required a total colectomy. She had previously been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and suffered episodes of hypoglycaemia whilst in hospital. She was noted to have suffered another episode of hypoglycaemia on 24 April 2022, which was addressed. However, she did not have further blood glucose results analysed until after 3am the next morning (despite entries in the records, which were seemingly falsified). Two results were obtained via blood gas analysis within minutes of each other. Both showed an unrecordably low glucose but subsequent action was not taken, based on these results. I heard evidence that most medical staff are aware that blood gas analysers show an unrecordably low glucose as '- – -↓' but that this can be interpreted as meaning that the sample was not analysable. Ms Morgan-Gray's hypoglycaemia was not recognised for several hours, by which time she had suffered a consequential brain injury. This condition contributed to her death but the direct cause was an infection arising from her earlier abdominal surgery. She died on 15 May 2022.","During the course of this inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 1 The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Ms Morgan-Gray's death were as follows: 1. A concern regarding the interpretation of blood gas machine readings. Specifically, when blood glucose levels are unrecordably low, the machines report this as '- - -↓'. This display can be misinterpreted as indicating the sample is unanalysable, rather than accurately reflecting an extremely low glucose level. This misinterpretation could lead to delayed or inappropriate clinical responses, potentially resulting in future deaths. It was unclear why the results are not recorded as 'Low' or similar. As the regulator of medical devices, I made the decision to write this report to you, rather than an individual manufacturer, as I believe you have the power to direct all manufacturers of such devices to ensure they provide clear and easily interpretable results. 6 ACTION COULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action could be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the addressee has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 31 June 2025.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was – John James Johnson died on 22 nd November 2023 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead from pneumonia. This has developed as a consequence of the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung. These are both naturally occurring diseases running their full course resulting in his death. The cancer was first detected on his admission to hospital in April 2022, but this finding was not investigated or any treatment commenced. Upon presenting to hospital in May 2023, the cancer had progressed significantly and treatment options to cure the cancer were not available. Treatment designed to prolong his life were commenced, but he suffered a period of deterioration in his condition due to the progression of the cancer and died as a result. Natural Causes contributed to by neglect. 1a Pneumonia 1b Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Right Lung 1c II","Mr Johnston presented at the Emergency Department of the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, Gateshead in April 2023 with a broken leg after falling off a ladder. As part of the investigations undertaken at this time was a chest x-ray which showed a suspicious solitary mass lesion 32mm in size in the right upper zone and at the base of the left lung field. It was to the reporting radiographer as highly suggestive of an underlying malignancy. This finding was flagged in the report comments and with a red alert marker. The report was sent to the referrer who was in the ED Department of the hospital, however by this stage of Mr Johnson's care in the hospital he was in the care of the Orthopaedics Department and also it appears on balance he either had just left or was in the process of leaving the hospital on discharge. The referring clinician, as was ED practice filed the report on the basis the current treating department – Orthopaedics or others still involved in his care would review the report. This did not happen as on balance Mr Johnson was leaving or had left the hospital and their care by then. The red alert was ignored as it was assumed to related to the fracture not the suspected cancer. Mr Johnson did not receive any follow up in relation to the X-Ray finding and then presented in May 2023 at the same hospital with pain and investigations at this time detected a large right sided lung mass invading the spine. Treatment options were limited by this stage due to the progression of the cancer and they were related to control of the cancer as opposed to its removal and cure. He deteriorated and died on 22nd November 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) During the course of my investigation I heard evidence of the Hospital Trust operating a variety of IT systems to document a patient's stay in hospital. There was not one system which contained all the information generated during a patient's stay in hospital including, but not limited to, test results. It required clinical users to switch between systems to gather all the necessary information and raised the potential risk of significant findings being overlooked. It also slows down clinical decision making and makes it more difficult to follow a patient's overall care. (2) In Mr Johnson's case, the X Ray report was returned to a department not then involved in his care. The use of multiple systems can create a risk around safe transfers of care for discharge or handover. (3) I was told this issue is not confined to one individual Trust and the use of multiple systems is widespread across the National Health Service. Their use is well known to the national NHS responsible bodies. (4) The Trust in question, has undertaken significant work to make the multiple systems it uses as safe and effective as possible so far as they are able to within their effective control.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Sarah Boyle died as a result of a self-applied ligature. Her intention at the time of applying the ligature cannot be determined.,"Sarah Boyle was detained at HMP Styal between 8 April 2024 and 11 July 2024. She was monitored via the ACCT process for the entirety of that period save for one day (the ACCT was closed on 9 July and re-opened on 10 July following an act of self harm). Sarah suffered from emotionally unstable personality disorder, a condition which is associated with thoughts of self harm and suicide. She was not on the caseload of the mental health team in prison as was not felt to meet the criteria, but was assessed for psychological therapies. A formulation and plan was made from this assessment but it could not start prior to her release on 11 July. On 13 July, Sarah was recalled to prison due to a breach of her licence. It became apparent during her court hearing that she had tried to end her life by ligature whilst released (11-12 July) and again tried to ligature [REDACTED] whilst in the custody of GeoAmey, prior to transfer back to HMP Styal. On reception screening, Sarah was assessed by a prison officer and, whilst she did not fully engage, responded 'yes' to the question of d you have any current thoughts of self harm or suicide. The prison officer did not immediately open an ACCT as she wanted more information, and commented that the vast majority of women in reception will indicate they want to end their life. Sarah was subsequently seen by a nurse for a healthcare screening, who opened an ACCT. On 14 July, in the morning, Sarah was found to have tied a ligature around her neck in her cell, and this was discovered when the officer attended to carry out the ACCT assessment. She did not require any medical intervention and the ligature was removed. Shortly after (within the hour), the mental health team attended to carry out the well person assessment, as was routine for every new prisoner at that time. The assessment was unable to be completed as Sarah did not engage. Sarah then walked off from the mental health nurses, and tried to get over the railings on the second floor landing. She was restrained and taken back to her cell. An ACCT case review was attempted by the officer, without healthcare input, but Sarah did not engage. Her observations were increased from hourly to two an hour and she was to remain in her cell due to the risk of her getting at height. At around 5pm that evening, Sarah was discovered in her cell with a ligature around her neck, [REDACTED]. A code blue was called, and paramedics attended, taking her to hospital. She had suffered irreversible brain damage and died on 20 July 2024.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: I am concerned that the ACCT process or system currently in place designed to keep women safe at HMP Styal is not working effectively, and that there is a risk of future deaths if the process is not reconsidered or amended to better suit the needs of this prison. The ACCT process allows for observations of a woman who is at risk of self harm or suicide to keep her safe, but these are not a therapeutic observation and are essentially a check to ensure that the woman is alive and not actively self harming. Mental health input, if a woman is not case loaded to the mental health team, can be minimal, limited to attendance at a case review at best, and this does not allow for an opportunity to improve the woman's mental health, to reduce the risk of future suicide attempts. Care plans allowing for meaningful activity assist but their effectiveness is limited alongside the prison regime. I acknowledge that prison is not intended to be a therapeutic environment but given the number of women with mental health needs, I am concerned that the current environment or processes will give rise to a risk of future deaths. My concerns are based on the following points which I heard in evidence: • HMP Styal is a women's prison with a high number of self inflicted deaths, compared to the rest of the female estate. I am told by the prison ombudsman that they have the highest number of deaths between January 2022 and January 2025, accounting on my calculation for almost half of the total deaths in the female estate across England. I am aware that there has been one self inflicted death this year to date, and we are only 4 months in; • I heard evidence from the Head of Safer Prisons and Equality at HMP Styal and the Service Manager for Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS FT, who provide the mental health care in the prison, that the mental health needs of the women detained at Styal are high and can be complex. The latter explained that they receive women from court who have been sent to prison following a criminal act but are essentially awaiting assessment to see whether they should be detained in prison, or in a mental health hospital. The mental health team is then expected to care for the woman for the prolonged period of assessment and awaiting a bed if deemed necessary, something they are not set up to do. It was the view of this witness that Styal was receiving a number of prisoners who are complex and risky and require treatment in a mental health hospital. The process for transfer then takes time and is an additional pressure on the team. The powers of a mental health team in prison are far more restricted, for example, they cannot force medication if needed, and it is reliant on the engagement of prisoners which they frequently do not get. The mental health Trust confirmed that in 2025 to date (29.4.25), 11 prisoners have been referred for a Mental Health Act assessment and of these 11, 8 were accepted for transfer and treatment in a mental health inpatient setting; • It was the evidence of the Head of Safer Prisons and Equality that they also receive women who are there for a 'warrant of concern'. A 'warrant of concern' is where a woman attends court and is not sentenced at that point but remanded into prison custody due to the Judge having concerns that they are not safe to be released into the community and Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 where it is perceived that they will be safer in custody. This is usually where there are concerns around the woman's mental health and/or risk to self. This adds pressure on an already stretched resource level in prisons as more resources are generally required to manage such complex individuals; Prison data suggests that HMP Styal have received 7 women on 'warrants of concern' since November 2024 to date (April 2025); • I heard from one witness that a 'good day' on one side of the wing would just be one incident of self harm, but there would be frequently multiple incidents; • The number of self harm incidents and ACCT documents open appears to have hardened the prison team to expressions of self harm etc. I heard comments throughout the inquest such as “If I opened an ACCT on every woman who said she was suicidal we'd have loads open”, and “2 incidents of self harm in a morning for one prisoner might seem like a lot but it's not in the context of Styal”. This may lead to key cases being missed;  The number of ACCTs open within the prison can be high given the mental health need. I have heard evidence from a number of witnesses as to the pressures that the ACCT process places on staff, primarily due to the high number compared to staffing numbers. The severity of this varied in evidence depending seemingly on whether the member of staff was still with the prison service or had left. The clear consensus however was that the carrying out of ACCT checks, meaningful conversations and documentation of this was difficult whilst also trying to manage the day to day regime. It was accepted by the Head of Safer Prisons and Equality at HMP Styal that the officer on duty on the day of Sarah's death would have been responsible for 48 checks an hour, and that was not unusual. Evidence from one witness, who has since left the prison, was that as a result of the number of checks required, and the limited resource to do them, checks were frequently missed;  Meaningful conversations, designed to find out how the person is feeling and check in with them, are being carried out by prison officers with very limited mental health training, with very limited time resource to do this. Mental health training is not mandatory for the officers and can be overlooked due to more pressing, mandatory training. The jury findings record “Understaffing and a high number of ACCT documents at HMP Styal led to inconsistencies with how staff completed each part of the ACCT process”. In addition to the evidence heard from the witnesses, I am mindful of the report of HM Chief Inspector of Prisons (Time to care: what helps women cope in prison February 2025) which notes that the rate of self harm among women in prison is now 8.5 times higher than in men's jails, and highlights a number of issues which contribute to this, which have been reflected in this inquest. 6",35,N/A: Not found

Secretary of State for Health & Social Care 1,"On 1 June 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Paul Anthony Burke, aged 41. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Burke died as a consequence of Type 2 Respiratory failure, the underlying cause of which was not promptly identified nor treated, thereby contributing to his death. The medical cause of death was found to be: 1a. Type 2 Respiratory Failure 1b. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome and Congestive Cardiac Failure 2. Obesity – Grade 3","Mr Burke was a 41-year-old gentleman with a past medical history that included Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. On 19 December 2022 he called for an ambulance due to experiencing worsening shortness of breath. The first call to the ambulance service was at 14:07hrs. This generated a category 2 response, requiring an ambulance resource within an average of 18 minutes, with 90% of calls being responded to within 40 minutes. There were further calls to the ambulance service at 14:59hrs, 16:31hrs and 19:09hrs. Throughout this time, the call remained as a category 2 response. No ambulance resource was sent. The final call to the ambulance service was at 20:16hrs, a little over 6 hours from the original call to advise the ambulance service that Mr Burke was being taken to hospital by car by members of his family who had come to assist. Mr Burke arrived at Watford General Hospital at around 20:51hrs. During initial assessment a venous blood gas (VBG) identified that he was experiencing Type 2 Respiratory Failure, and he was therefore transferred to the resuscitation area of the emergency department. Over the following hours he was reviewed by a number of clinicians, all of whom were not aware of the VBG result, and made a diagnosis of fluid overload due to likely heart failure. However, there was no detailed consideration of the underlying cause for Mr Burke's worsening respiratory function even though his past medical history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome was known. At around 22:30hrs on 20 December 2022, Mr Burke's condition deteriorated. Arterial blood gas (ABG) testing was undertaken which showed that he was significantly unwell and in Type 2 Respiratory Failure. Consequently, Mr Burke was transferred to the Acute Respiratory Care Unit and was placed on non-invasive ventilation. Sadly, this was not successful and Mr Burke suffered a respiratory collapse and passed away at 07:44hrs on 22 December 2022. On the facts of this particular case, whilst the inability of the ambulance service to send a resource to Mr Burke leading to his delayed presentation to hospital was recognised; the delay was unlikely to have more than minimally contributed to his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. Delay in ambulance response and the consequent delay in the provision of pre- hospital emergency care. As set out above, Mr Burke first made a call to the ambulance service at 14:07hrs on 19 December 2022. The call was triaged as requiring a category 2 response, requiring a response within an average of 18 minutes, with 90% of calls being responded to within 40 minutes. I received evidence that category 2 calls are for those whose condition is potentially serious and require rapid assessment, urgent on scene intervention or urgent transport to hospital. By way of example, patients who fall within this category can include those who are unconscious, experiencing chest pain or suffering with stroke symptoms. Despite the urgency with which an ambulance was required for Mr Burke no ambulance resource was available. It was only due to the intervention of his family who came to his aid that he was able to get to hospital – others may not be so fortunate. I heard evidence that on 19 December 2022, the local ambulance service was under extreme pressure. At 14:40hrs on 19 December 2022, the ambulance service had a total of 243 outstanding category 2 calls waiting for an ambulance response. 37 of these were within the Hertfordshire area. This was compounded by the fact that 11 ambulances were delayed at Watford General Hospital, one of which had been waiting to handover their patient for over 5 hours. At 18:01hrs on 19 December 2022, this had grown to 315 outstanding category 2 calls waiting for an ambulance response. 47 of these were within the Hertfordshire area. This was compounded by the fact that 9 ambulances were delayed at Watford General Hospital, waiting to hand over patients. Whilst it is clear that the ambulance service were under extreme pressure on 19 December 2022, on the evidence I heard, this is not an isolated incident. In December of 2022 the average response time for a category 2 ambulance was 61 minutes. In December 2023 the Page 3 of 3 average response time for a category 2 ambulance was 125 minutes. In December 2024 the average response time for a category 2 ambulance was 50 minutes. These times are against a target average response time of 18 minutes. The East of England Ambulance Service (EEAS) has and continues to take action in conjunction with relevant stakeholders to try and minimise these delays. However, there is only so much they and other parties can do. On the evidence that I heard the reasons for ambulance delays appear to be multi-factorial and includes issues throughout the wider health system and are issues not unique to Hertfordshire. In light of the above, I have a concern that is a risk of future deaths occurring due to continuing delays in the provision of pre-hospital emergency care which appear to be multi-factorial in nature. 6",41,N/A: Not found

Secretary of State for Transport 1,"On 4 November 2024 an inquest was opened into the death of Rosemary McAndrew, aged 64. The inquest concluded on 28 April 2025. I made a determination at inquest that she died as a result of a road traffic collision.","Rosemary McAndrew died on 5 July 2024 at Waitrose, Newark, Nottinghamshire, as a result of chest injuries, sustained in a Road Traffic Collision, when she was a pedestrian in the carpark of the store. She was struck by a motor car that was reversing at speed and became trapped beneath the vehicle. The motor vehicle was being driven by an 89-year-old male who was not able to account for the manner in which the vehicle was driven. It was suspected by paramedics who attended the scene that the driver may have had a neurological event whilst driving the vehicle. In the two years preceding the collision his mobility had reduced, he reported back and leg pains to his GP, and in October 2023 he presented to the local Emergency Department with neurological symptoms, suspected to be as a result of a TIA. In the months preceding the collision he had seen his GP with itching and pains in his legs. He died eight months after the collision of dementia and gangrene in both feet. As the guidance currently stands, none of the above conditions present prior to the collision were notifiable to the DVLA pursuant to the 'Assessing Fitness To Drive: a Guide for Medical Professionals'. The above conditions would have been self-reportable by the driver if he considered they could affect his driving safety. No such self-referral had been made.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 2 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The UK population is of increasing age and the number of older drivers is increasing rapidly. The current system for vehicle licensing relies largely upon the self-awareness of a driver and their willingness and\or ability to self-report medical conditions to the DVLA. I am concerned that older drivers with vulnerabilities, including age, decreasing mobility and cognitive decline pose a risk of future deaths through compromised driving ability thereby creating a risk of deaths in the future. 6",64,N/A: Not found

She had died on the 1 st June 2023 aged 12 years at St George's Hospital, Blackshaw Road, Tooting, London. She had died after she had been left unsupervised in her residential care home, The Children's Trust, Tadworth Court, for approximately fifteen minutes, despite being on one-to-one care for tracheostomy care and other medical conditions and disabilities. Her tracheostomy tube was blocked by secretions and as no carer was present to clear it, she suffered respiratory compromise and arrested. She was resuscitated at the scene but later died of hypoxic brain injury. Medical Cause of Death 1 a. Hypoxic ischaemic brain injury 1b Cardiac arrest 1c Post viral respiratory secretions II Pneumonia How, when, where and in what circumstances the deceased came by her death: Raihana had been born prematurely at only 27 weeks gestation and as such suffered with significant medical illnesses and disabilities. She was tracheostomy dependent for breathing. She was resident at the Children's Trust (TCT) where she should have received one to one nursing care to safeguard her tracheostomy. She had recently suffered viral pneumonia requiring ventilation on PICU and was discharged back to TCT on 23 rd May 2023. She was recovering from the pneumonia but still had some increased respiratory secretions requiring an increase in nebulisation therapy and increasing her respiratory vulnerability. On 29/5/2023 her allocated carer left the unit to undertake an administrative task at 19:25-19:30, handing over her nursing care to a nurse due to go off shift. At approximately 19:35, this nurse in turn handed over to another nurse (nurse two) as her shift had ended. Nurse two did not supervise Raihana, instead was caring for another child. At approximately 19:50 Raihana's allocated nurse returned to find that Raihanna had arrested. The alarm was raised, CPR started, and an ambulance called. A return of circulation was achieved at 20:26 and Raihana was transferred to St George's Hospital. Sadly, she died of hypoxic ischaemic brain injury at 19:34 hours on 01/06/2023. Her arrest had been caused by secretions partially blocking her tracheostomy tube. If she had been appropriately observed between 19:35 and 19:50 this would have been recognised and resolved and on the balance of probabilities she would not have died at this time. This failure to adequately observe her was a gross failure in care by the nursing staff. This was compounded by the lack of sufficient staff on the unit where Raihana lived to provide proper 1:1 care. Final Conclusion: Natural Causes Contributed to by neglect.","Evidence relevant to the matters of concern. Extensive evidence was taken and exhibited and some potential regulation 28 matters explored. Of relevance to this report: 1. Raihana's mother raised on a number of occasions that her daughter, contrary to the agreed level of around the clock one to one care, with two to one for personal care, she had observed her daughter to be left with no supervising carer. This was discussed at meetings at the TCT but continued to happen. In particular a written complaint made by Raihana's mother raised this matter and gave a detailed example. This was responded to by TCT by a generic response that Raihana did receive appropriate care without any evidence that the specific example raised was investigated or acted upon. 2. Subsequent to this complaint a member of TCT staff was disciplined in relation to a further occasion when Raihana was left alone, but neither Raihana's named social worker from the London Borough of Croydon, nor Raihana's mother were informed. 3. There were multiple meetings between Raihana's mother, the named social worker and managers at TCT at which various matters of concern were raised. There was no evidence that these matters nor actions to address them were sufficiently communicated to those caring for Raihana on a day-to-day basis. 4. The carer allocated to look after Raihana at the material time left the unit and went to another unit to fetch a laminator. It was while she was absent that Raihana arrested. 5. Following Raihana's death, TCT undertook an investigation which failed to uncover what had happened or to understand the cause of her death. This meant that a nurse, to whom Raihana's care had been handed to by the allocated carer was blamed by the TCT and was referred to the NMC erroneously. Evidence taken at the inquiry found issues with the credibility of another nurse (nurse two) who should have been caring for Raihana, this responsibility having been handed over to her by the first nurse leaving as her shift was over. This was supported by evidential inconsistencies between witnesses, timing matters and evidence given contemporaneously that should have been evident when TCT investigated. 6. Evidence was taken as to what one to one meant in practice that highlighted for hours every day Raihana would have been on one to two care, once meetings, breaks, handovers, requirement for two to one to be given to other residents, and medication administration etc. was factored in. There were simply insufficient staff to provide constant one to one care, as understood it should have been provided and commissioned by the LA. There was confusion as to what one to one meant at the time of the Raihana's death and how it is practiced now by carers and nurses who gave evidence. There will still be occasions when vulnerable residents such as Raihana will be left one to two, with eyes on only observation, despite an apparent increase in numbers of staff on duty at any one time, albeit it should happen less often.","1. That children such as Raihana requiring one to one care are still at times receiving less intensive care and supervision than they require.

2. That there may be culture of cover up at the TCT, in that they carried out a flawed investigation after this incident, pushing blame onto an innocent individual and thereby avoiding highlighting systemic failures and learning and thus risking lessons that should be learned are lost that could prevent future deaths.

3. That TCT do not sufficiently communicate with the commissioning LA nor next of kin in relation to issues with care and supervision, for example not informing the named social worker nor the mother of the disciplinary proceedings against a staff member who left Raihana alone. This in turn leaves vulnerable residents at risk, as the named social workers and possibly the commissioning authority nor the next of kin will be aware of potential increased risks to the vulnerable child. This matter also goes to matter 2 above.

4. That there may be staff training issues in relation to what one to one care means in practice.

5. That there may be training issues in relation to the prioritisation of administrative tasks above care.

6. That next of kin are not sufficiently listened to when they raise concerns, and their complaints are dismissed without sufficient investigation.

7. That the systems of communication between those attending planning and review meetings and those providing care to the residents are inadequate, such that matters raised at these meetings and any actions agreed to address them are insufficiently communicated to those providing care to the residents.",12,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was; Natural causes.,"At 10.45am on 23 November 2024, Peter sadly died from a pulmonary embolism in Birmingham Heartlands Hospital. He had been admitted to hospital the day prior on 22 November 2024 and was receiving treatment for a community acquired pneumonia when he suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed, in keeping with a pulmonary embolism. Peter had previously suffered a number of falls at home in August and September 2021 and was subsequently diagnosed with suffering a spontaneous infection of the cervical vertebral canal which caused a complete spinal cord injury and left him tetraplegic. This made him more vulnerable to chest infections and pulmonary embolisms which he experienced in the years that followed. There is no evidence of any human intervention that rendered his death unnatural. Based on information from the Deceased's treating clinicians the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Pulmonary Embolism 1b 1c 1d II Pneumonia Spinal cord injury resulting in Tetraplegia","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – • To The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust 1. I considered evidence from a who indicated at paragraphs 20-21 of his statement, “I did not see any record of his pulse, blood pressure or oxygen saturation. The normal practice is to complete these observations, and I would expect this to be done, especially with him presenting with chest issues. However, I am unable to comment why this was not recorded or confirm that these were carried out. (21) This is a learning point for the department, and I have taken steps to ensure this learning is taken forward by the Trust. I have alerted the Sister in charge of the Spinal Injuries Outpatients' Department and requested that adequate measures are taken to ensure that all observations made are recorded in the outpatient forms...” 2. It was unclear whether this was a single one-off event involving human error or indicative of a wider and systemic issue involving a lack of training. There was no evidence before the court that this “learning point” had been actioned or that any adequate steps had been taken to ensure proper and accurate recording of records by staff. 3. There is a real risk of future deaths occurring where staff do not have adequate training and that patient records are not being properly completed. • To NHS England / Department of Health and Social Care 1. I heard evidence that The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (""The Trust"") have been experiencing difficulties with patient waiting lists - due to both an increase in the quantity of patients being treated and staffing shortages - which has led to patients waiting longer than is reasonable or necessary for reviews and treatments. As part of the inquest, there was evidence that Peter Anzani himself had been waiting for nearly a year for a follow-up review, which should have been carried out after no more than 6 months. 2. I heard evidence from representatives of the Trust that they have repeatedly requested additional funds for workforce development and expansion to assist with cutting patient waiting lists and waiting times. I understand that an initial Workplace Funding Review was submitted in 2023 but was rejected by NHS England due to a funding shortage. I understand that a further Workplace Funding Review was submitted in the Autumn of 2024, but in February/March of this year, NHS England indicated that the same would again be rejected under a ""no growth policy"". 3. Whilst naturally I am aware of the pressures on the public purse and on the NHS generally, it is concerning to hear that the Trust do not appear to be being adequately supported financially by NHS England, and do not currently appear to be able to address their workplace staffing issues without additional financial support (which does not appear to be forthcoming). 4. It is obvious that where patients are waiting for longer than is reasonable or necessary for treatment or reviews, there is a real risk of deaths occurring. No patient should be waiting longer than absolutely necessary for treatment. 5. In light of HM Government's decision on 13 March 2025 to abolish NHS England and for its role to be subsumed within the Department of Health and Social Care, this report is being sent to both Agencies to consider, as it relates to issues of both a local and national significance. 6",68,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday. I made a determination at inquest that Jannat died as a consequence of trauma suffered during birth as a result of shoulder dystocia.","Jannat was a big baby and her mother had a history of shoulder dystocia with two out of her three previous pregnancies. Her mum received midwifery and obstetric care for the two pregnancies at University College London Hospital (UCLH), and Jannat was delivered there. Unfortunately, the fact of the shoulder dystocia was not communicated to Jannat's parents after the earlier births, and was not recognised by the staff at UCLH during this pregnancy. If it had been, Jannat's mother would have been offered a Caesarean section for Jannat's delivery. A Caesarean section would have avoided the shoulder dystocia that caused Jannat's death.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. With the benefit of a maternity and newborn safety investigation (MNSI), UCLH is undertaking a significant piece of work to improve its systems. However, there remains one outstanding point. When all else had failed, Jannat was finally delivered by use of a manoeuvre called a shoulder shrug. I heard at inquest that this is not a manoeuvre included within the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines, but it is used abroad. One of the obstetric registrars looking after Jannat's mother had seen it in a training video. I wonder if there is merit in considering this for inclusion in the next set of relevant NICE guidelines, whenever these are updated? 6",0,N/A: Not found

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2nd Floor Redmond Place, London E20 1JQ 1","On 6 th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Anne Potter, aged 54, (known as “Anne”). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 10 th March 2025. The conclusion of the jury inquest was a short form conclusion of Suicide in box 4. The Jury's answer to 'when, where and how' was recorded in box 3 of the Record of Inquest as follows: “Anne was a 54 year old menopausal woman experiencing a number of stresses in her life. The menopause contributed to her mental health decline and exacerbated her underlying anxiety. On the 27 th September 2002, Anne took an overdose of paracetamol. She was taken to Yeovil District Hospital where she received treatment. She then received daily community mental health support. After found wandering in traffic and absconding from her home, on the 20 th October 2022, she agreed to a voluntary admission to Rowan Ward. She was then detained on a section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. On the 21 st October 2022 this was upgraded to a section 2 detention. On the 24 th October 2022, she was granted her first Section 17 Leave. On the 31 st October 2022, on a walk with a Health Care Assistant, Anne attempted to run into the road. On the 16 th November 2022, due to a number of incidents and no possible community support options, she was upgraded to a Section 3 detention. During her review on the 29 th November 2022, Anne was authorised for Section 17 Leave for an overnight stay at home on the 4 th December 2022. On the 3 rd December 2022 she had a day with her family in Bristol. On the morning of the 4 th December 2022, following staff assessment of Anne, the overnight leave was granted. Anne's family did not receive appropriate information to assist them in keeping Anne safe for an overnight stay. She went home on the 4 th December 2022 and in the morning of the Fifth December 2022 Anne used a key to open the back door, took a car key and drove away. Anne was driving on the Eastbound carriageway of the A303 and at 07:48 she deliberately drove into the path of a HGV tank lorry on the opposite carriageway.” The medical cause of death was recorded as: Ia) Multiple traumatic injuries","Anne first presented to her GP in 2008. During this year she had three separate appointments relating to underlying anxiety and being unable to cope. There was no secondary mental health service involvement, nor was there any prescription of anti- depressants at this time. Anne presented to the GP again in 2014, so six years later. Her presentation at this time was felt by the GP to be a grief/bereavement reaction. From early 2017 up to the end of 2019 there were five separate consultations for gynaecological and/or gastroenterological presentations but despite secondary investigations, no underlying physiological cause was found and the GP felt that there was a high possibility that her tummy and bowel issues were related to her underlying anxiety. On the 18 th December 2020, Anne had her first significant consultation about mental health symptoms. She was extremely anxious and low in mood and stressed with life in general. On the 11 th January 2021 Anne was emotionally fragile, anxious and stressed. This was the first consultation at which menopause (or perimenopause) was mentioned. Given her presentation it would appear that her underling anxiety had been slowly building; possibly since 2008 but much more so since 2017. Anne started taking Sertraline in February 2021 (she was prescribed this in the January but was too anxious about side effects to start taking it). She was also started on HRT. By the end of May 2021 her symptoms appeared to be under control but it was impossibly to know if this was the Sertraline, the HRT or a combination of both. In July of 2021, following consultation with her GP, the dose of Sertraline was titrated down so that by the Autumn of 2021 she had stopped taking this medication altogether. In early September 2022, Anne's presentation declined again and she agreed to re- start Sertraline. On the 27 th September 2022 Anne was at home with her husband when she informed him she'd taken [REDACTED] tablets. This was the first time Anne had done anything like this before and it was very much the start of her acute decline. After discharge from hospital she was seen daily by the mental health team, and declined an admission. On the 20 th October 2022, Anne did agree to a voluntary admission to an acute psychiatric unit. This was after she had been returned home by the police who responded to a member of the public who had called in after finding her wandering in traffic. Anne was detained under section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. She remained detained up till the date of her death; being placed on a Section 2 detention and this was upgraded to a Section 3 detention on the 16 th November 2022. Anne had a devoted and supportive husband and family, who were keen to be involved in her care and recovery; so much so that Anne started taking section 17 leave from the 24 th October 2022 (3 days after she was detained). She would take escorted leave with either the staff or her husband in the local area for a couple of hours (gradually increasing to up to 6 hours at a time). On the 31 st October 2022 whilst out with staff Anne ran into the road and was pulled back by the Health Care Assistant. It was never established what Anne was actually trying to do on this occasion; whether she was trying to harm herself or whether she was simply trying to avoid going back to the ward as she did not like the ward environment and had said that she would rather be at home with her husband. She remained on the ward without leave for three days after this incident. On the 29 th November 2022 an MDT (Multi Disciplinary Meeting) took place. At this meeting section 17 overnight leave was authorised for the 4 th December 2022 on the basis that there had been no incidents of risky behaviour and/or absconding (with the exception of the 31 st October 2022) and since that incident leave between the 4 th and 29 th November 2022 had gone 'well'. Both Anne and her husband were keen for overnight leave and it was felt entirely appropriate to support this wish as part of her recovery. Anne went out for 6 hours on the 3 rd December 2022 to a Christmas market in Bristol with her husband. This leave went well and without incident. Anne appeared brighter; she was showing future planning with her family for the forthcoming Christmas period and was commenting on finding pleasure and enjoyment in things again (the mental health team highlighted her enjoyment at watching Strictly Come Dancing which whilst small, highlighted a departure from her previous anhedonia). Anne was assessed by a mental health nurse prior to her overnight leave on the 4 th December 2022. There were no concerning or alarming features or presentation that would have given the nurse (or the entire mental health team involved in her care) any clinical reason to withhold her planned leave. The entire treating team were all very clear that there was no reason to not “let her out” that day. Her husband came to collect her at just after 10am that morning. He was not given any formal or codified 'Risk Assessment' document, but he had been very heavily involved in his wife's care and treatment every step of the way and so the evidence was clear; even if he had been given such a document it would not have contained any information or details that wasn't already within his knowledge. Overnight the leave appeared to go well. Anne's husband had locked the doors and windows and hidden those keys in a desk drawer. He did not hide the car keys as he did not think for one minute that his wife would take the car. That morning Anne found the back door key in the desk drawer and took the car. She was seen driving erratically by multiple other road users who were travelling eastbound on the A303 that morning. At around 07:48 Anne drove her car into the path of a fully laden HGV tanker travelling on the westbound carriageway. There was nothing the tanker driver could have done to avoid the collision. Anne died instantly of multiple traumatic injuries. It came to light after Anne's death that she had been using her own personal device (mobile or tablet) to access websites pertaining to self harm. It is unknown whether she had accessed the psychiatric unit's wifi or whether she had made searches using her own personal data from her phone provider contract.","4 During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Part 1 (1) Anne was not sent home for her first overnight leave with any codified 'Risk' and 'Safety Planning' document. Whilst it was widely accepted in this case that Anne's husband was well versed and knowledgeable about his wife's risks and the measures that might be necessary to help keep her safe whilst she was at home, not all families are as involved in their loved one's psychiatric care, despite the Trust following the Triangle of Care principles. Whilst families are not mental health practitioners and are not expected to adopt that role within the community there appears to be an opportunity to supply families with a short, codified document dealing with salient points of risks and safety planning when a patient goes for their first overnight leave since being detained. This may equip families with the knowledge to spot signs of declining mental presentation and/or risk and provide them with the knowledge and/or tools to take appropriate steps to assist in safeguarding their loved ones whilst they are in the community. This concern (and any action deemed appropriate by the recipients of this PFD) is not intended to override autonomy of the patient and their own ability/responsibility to keep themselves safe, but the concern centres around their being an opportunity to assist families in spotting early warning signs that 'something is wrong' and to seek help and intervention (if/when appropriate) to minimise the risk of a patient taking their own life whilst in the community. (2) It transpired during the Inquest that if an in-patient (detained or voluntary) accesses the secure unit Wi-Fi there are no algorithms or 'search detection features' to prevent access to websites pertaining to self harm and so these can be readily accessed by a group who are already vulnerable due to their acute mental health presentation with some element of inherent risk of suicide. It was noted, quite rightly, by legal representatives that workplace organisations can block access to certain sites they deem it undesirable for their workforce to access (such as sites relating to gambling, sexually inappropriate content etc) which shows that it is possible to limit access to certain websites and content when using a Wi-Fi provider. By allowing an already vulnerable group to have unfettered access to websites dedicated to self harm creates a risk of further deaths. Part 2 (3) I am (and remain, having previously issued a PFD in a similar vain on the 26th June 2024) concerned about the lack of 'importance' given to menopausal care available to women on the NHS; especially when compared to private sector meaning that women who are not fortunate enough to be able to access private clinics and facilities may not be able to access the services and expertise they need at a very crucial transitional phase in their lives. Menopause is not a lifestyle choice, it is an unavoidable part of a woman's natural biological cycle. Without wishing to introduce sweeping generalisations, menopause is likely to affect 50% of the population at some point in their lives [according to Statistics Times, women made up 50.75% of the UK population in 2024]. I am concerned that: (i) Certain elements of medicine and clinical practice training are compulsory but having heard evidence at the Inquest around mandatory and statutory 5 training modules I learnt that this covers areas such as GDPR training and disposal of sharp objects such as syringes. I was surprised to learn that menopausal training is not mandatory in any area of clinical practice or specialism. I am concerned that there is no requirement to undertake essential compulsory menopausal training for those working in 'relevant' clinical practices such as Mental Health Practice, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Oncology, or even general as a general GP. (ii) I was told that the Trust has just one 'menopause specialist' (a GP) who covers the entire Trust operations. Not all GP surgeries have a menopause specialist practitioner (or access to one) despite a GP usually being the first port of call for women in the community when seeking primary care. Those GP Surgeries who do have a practitioner who acts as a 'specialist' is often a GP with a personal interest who has taken the initiative to go on courses and broaden their learning and understanding, rather than any mandatory requirement for a Surgery [or group with multiple surgeries] to have an available community 'front-line' specialist. I was told that the Trust does not have an “expert” in this field and it would be difficult to have one as menopause isn't a disease or an illness. Whilst I do not dispute that is it not a disease, menopause is a condition; it does have symptoms and it does have recognised presentations, yet there appears to be a failure to recognise this condition as having equal importance to other ailments or diagnoses. I was told during a previous PFD Response relating to menopausal knowledge and care within the NHS that “It is important to ensure that women understand common symptoms such as anxiety, stress and depression which they might experience during the menopause and where and when to seek help. The NHS website has resources….” This emphasises my concerns entirely; the lack of importance given to menopausal symptoms. If someone has concerns about heart disease, a worrying lump, a broken bone etc they expect to be able to consult a medically qualified professional who has a knowledge and understanding of their condition or presentation and can diagnose and treat accordingly; not just [and I paraphrase] 'have a look at a website to help'. I appreciate that each and every woman will experience perimenopause and menopause differently, their individual experience is unique to them and this, to some degree, creates difficulties as a 'one size fits all' approach (which is perhaps achievable in other medical specialisms and disciplines) cannot be offered, but the lack of recognition of the importance of this condition remains a significant concern. I had previously been told (back in a 2024 PFD response) of a roll-out of specialist menopausal care and upskilling of GPs but there was little evidence during the inquest that this has happened/is happening and women continue to approach and navigate the menopause without the support of expert clinicians or practitioners who understand and can treat the symptoms they are experiencing. 6",54,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 January 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a) Ischaemic Heart Disease and Drowning The conclusion of the inquest was: Died due to accident caused by underlying natural causes.,"In summary, on the 17th of August 2024 Mr Mills went to view a shipwreck off the coast of Brancaster beach in Norfolk. While doing so he went under the water when the tide came in and a search operation was launched by the Coast Guard. He was sadly found unresponsive in the sea and despite attempts to revive him, he died after being airlifted to the local airport. At the Inquest concern was raised by Mr Mills' family that there was not actually a sign at the site of the shipwreck warning of the dangers of the tides at the wreck. Reference was made to some signs which are pictured online, but it was unclear to me whether they were current and in place and in a bundle of photographs that had been provided by the National Trust with warning signs, they did not provide photographs of any signs at the site of the wreck. I was unclear if this was because they are no longer there or just that they did not realise these may be of assistance. As this issue was raised at the hearing and we had not had the opportunity to ask the questions of National Trust prior to this, I was unclear whether my obligation under Regulation 28 had been triggered. I therefore indicated that I would write a letter to obtain more information and decide upon receipt of that response. This however then triggered a whole series of correspondence, the outcome of which, is that no one seems to know who is responsible for the shipwreck.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. While such a report should normally be issued within 10 working days of the conclusion of the Inquest, it has taken until now, having made attempts after the inquest to establish the answer to concerns raised, and I therefore issue the report within 10 working days of becoming aware that my obligation is triggered as I have not been able to establish that appropriate safety measure are in place for the reasons I detail below. All relevant correspondence can be provided, but in summary: 1. I wrote to the National Trust on 29 January 2025 setting out my concerns following the Inquest and seeking further information on signage and any other incidents at the location. 2. By return letter received on 13 February 2025 I was advised that the wreck of the ship, SS Vina, was not the responsibility of National Trust (and they only provided the signage on shore), and that their understanding was that it was owned and managed by Trinity House. Further, the land upon which the wreck sits is on long full-repairing lease to Natural England. 3. We therefore contacted Natural England who, by email of 12 March 2025, advised that there is no sign on the wreck, but that due to it being submerged at high tide, that would be impractical. They stated however that the wreck is the property of Trinty House, who may consider a sign on the mast. 4. An email from Trinity House on 13 March 2025 stated however that they are not the legal owner of the wreck and had previously corresponded with the National Trust to advise them of this. 5. Upon seeking further clarification from the National Trust, they advised on 14 April 2025 that they had previously been advised that Trinity House had taken possession of the wreck of SS Vina. Trinity House provided correspondence between the organisations to advise this was not the case. 6. Upon further enquiry with HM Coastguard to try and resolve this issue, we received an email from them dated 16 April 2025. They have very helpfully tired to assist in resolving the question as to who is responsible for the wreck. However, they advise that the wreck was privately owned when it was requisitioned in World War 2 by the MOD, but their records do not show who currently owns it but suggest that the Department for Transport may be able to assist with ownership. 7. I have therefore reached a point where I am unable to establish who may be the owner of this wreck and responsible for considering concerns over the lack of signage warning of risks. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. I am concerned that, in light of the above, there is no safe system in place to ensure that an organisation is responsible for the management and safety of such shipwrecks which are accessible by members of the public. 2. With no clear system to ensure that the owners can be identified, there is no system to ensure that concerns can be raised with them when safety concerns arise. 3. That that wreckage does not have sufficient warnings at the location to alert members of the public, particularly those who are not familiar with the tidal waters, Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 of the dangers present at the wreck.",74,N/A: Not found

I will reflect that in this report. I conducted an inquest into the death of Lorraine Sandra Parker which concluded on 3 rd April 2025. She was 52, and died on 30 th March 2024. I recorded a narrative conclusion as follows: Natural causes, contributed to by cancer, by necessary surgical treatment, and by delay in diagnosing and managing anastomotic leak, after surgery conducted on 23rd of January 2024.","This can be summarised by my findings on the Record of Inquest as follows: Lorraine Parker had an operation for sigmoid colon cancer on 23rd of January 2024. Although there was some improvement in the patient's clinical condition, there was a delay in investigating clinical signs and blood markers, specifically CRP results, from 27th of January 2024. Lorraine was discharged home on 31st of January 2024 with no post- operative scan and a CRP of 173. The CRP result had been increasing over the past three days before her discharge. On return to hospital on the 1st of February, her CRP had continued to rise and a CT scan was carried out. The scan was misreported as showing no anastomotic leak. It was only when faeces began to leak from her wound that the scan was re-reviewed and noted to show anastomotic leak. She was initially managed conservatively, but was then returned to theatre. Her descending colon was noted to be disintegrated. Lorraine was managed on the intensive care unit between 5th and 14th of February, and on a ward thereafter before being discharged home on 23rd of February. She was re-admitted to hospital between 12th and 15th of March, when a drain was inserted to remove a pelvic collection. When attending a routine wound review appointment on 30th of March 2024, Lorraine became suddenly unwell. The crash team attended and resuscitation efforts were carried out, but she died that day, at Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading in Berkshire. Her cause of death was: 1a Pulmonary embolism 1b Deep Vein Thrombosis 2 Sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma (operated January 2024) I concluded that delay in diagnosing and managing anastomotic leak contributed to her death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. It is clearly the case that clinical judgment is the most important factor in deciding when a patient who has undergone major abdominal surgery requires a CT scan. Surgeons will “treat the patient, not the numbers”. 2. There is currently no guidance which requires surgeons to consider scanning for patients who have undergone major abdominal surgery and whose CRP is high and not decreasing, as was the case here at the time Lorraine was discharged from hospital on 31st January 2024. 3. There may be some difficulty in creating a hard line requirement for CT scanning based on a particular CRP result, but I am concerned that there is no guidance in place for requiring a consultant to consider this – perhaps when the CRP is above a certain figure and either not decreasing or continuing to rise. Any such guidance could still allow for clinical judgement – and documenting of the reasons for that decision. 4. It is my experience that clinical judgement alone, particularly where a patient looks well “from the end of the bed” is not always sufficient in this scenario. I have seen a number of avoidable death cases in this context. The purpose of blood test results is to flag up objective areas of concern. There is much reference to chasing up CRP results in Lorraine's records, but these do not appear to have been taken into account at the time that she was discharged from the hospital without a post- operative scan. 6",52,N/A: Not found

I will reflect that in this report. I conducted an inquest into the death of Lorraine Sandra Parker which concluded on 3 rd April 2025. She was 52, and died on 30 th March 2024. I recorded a narrative conclusion as follows: Natural causes, contributed to by cancer, by necessary surgical treatment, and by delay in diagnosing and managing anastomotic leak, after surgery conducted on 23rd of January 2024.","Lorraine Parker's death was the third in three months following surgery by the same consultant colorectal surgeon. I have raised concerns in that respect separately. The surgeon in question is no longer conducting major surgery at your trust or in the local private sector. I am not aware of any current GMC restriction on his clinical practice. With the permission of both families, I referred to two previous inquests – Mr MR (date of death 4 th March 2024), and Mr ME (date of death 28 th December 2023). I did this not to re-open the facts of the two earlier inquests, but to focus on the trust's death investigation processes, and how efficient they have been in terms of picking up issues following each of these deaths. I instructed independent colorectal surgery experts to comment on the management, using two different experts for the three cases. It is fair to say that both experts were critical of the surgeon's management. In looking at the trust's death investigation processes, I made the following findings: In the case of Mr ME, a significant surgical error was made when a healthy part of the bowel was removed instead of the area with the cancer, resulting in a much more extensive operation and Mr ME dying around 5 weeks later. This was discussed in a morbidity and mortality meeting, which ends with the simple phrase “await coroner's report”. A structured judgment review was carried out by a consultant colorectal colleague on 4 th of May 2024, over four months after the death. According to this review, all of the care given to Mr ME was either “good” or “excellent”. A further structured judgement review took place. It would appear that none of the colorectal surgeons was willing to carry this out, resulting in the need for a gastroenterologist to conduct a second review in July 2024, by which time the surgeon had already been suspended from major operative work. It is important to note that in a clinical governance meeting in February 2024 (ie before either of these structured judgement reviews) it was noted that there were “no learning points identified” in relation to Mr ME's case. In the case of Mr MR, a structured judgement review took place conducted by a consultant surgical colleague. This report was frankly so poor that I wrote to the Chief Medical Officer about it after the inquest. It has the look of the briefest of reviews and tick box exercises. Again, all of the management is referred to as “good”. Mr MR's case was not discussed during the March 2024 morbidity and mortality meeting, despite the fact that a later death (Lorraine Parker's, on 30 th March 2024) was discussed then. Mr MR's case did not go to a morbidity and mortality meeting discussion until May 2024. The reasons for this remain unclear. In Lorraine's case, there was a morbidity and mortality meeting discussion in March 2024 (or perhaps shortly thereafter). The April clinical governance meeting minutes refer to Lorraine's case and again state “no learning points”. None of these three cases has been the subject of a detailed PSIRF report. I have set out my concerns about the Trust's death investigation processes in more detail below. It is important to mention that I have found it far too difficult to extract the relevant documents from the trust in each of these cases. To expand on this: – During Lorraine's inquest, I received for the first time, a death investigation document relevant to Mr MR's case (an inquest I conducted in October 2024). – This difficulty extends routinely to obtaining medical records from this trust. This is not an issue which is shared with other trusts we work with within Berkshire. – RBH now has electronic records, and it is difficult for me to understand how it is that so many inquests I have conducted recently have had incomplete records. Provision of records found at short notice is rapidly becoming the norm. This is unhelpful to me and it is unhelpful to the bereaved families we deal with. It also means that death investigation processes are hampered and risk being incomplete. – This approach appears to apply to the clinical governance documents I have requested in each of these cases as well. I cannot be sure in any case whether I have received all of the relevant documents or not. I have not formed the view that this is due to a lack of candour, but whatever the reason, it is surprisingly inefficient for a trust of this size.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

On the evidence I have seen from the three inquests referred to, the Royal Berkshire Hospital's death investigation process is not working well. 2. I have seen evidence of delayed morbidity and mortality meetings with no clear system for ensuring that these discussions happen timeously. 3. There is little (if any) record of areas of concern identified at meetings – whether at morbidity and mortality meetings or clinical governance meetings. 4. There is delayed escalation of concerns. 5. Structured judgement reviews I have reviewed are at best, poor, and at worst, defensive. 6. Delayed or no scrutiny of cases being reported to the coroner because the cause of death is unnatural, given that medical examiners are not funded to scrutinise those cases. Opportunities for early learning are therefore being lost. 7. Systems of collating and providing medical records and clinical governance records to the coroner (and presumably to others involved in death investigation) are unreliable. 8. I am concerned about whether the trust has done enough to deal with the concerns about this particular surgeon, not just in the Berkshire area, but more widely. 6",52,N/A: Not found

The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Brazil unintentionally overdosed on benzodiazepines, which he was taking regularly and died a drugs related death.","Mr Brazil had suffered from an accident some time before his death in which he sustained injuries that left him with pain; he also suffered with sciatica and he became depressed during the pandemic. Mr Brazil accessed his GP and was prescribed some medication for his ailments but, in a bid to self-medicate in order to manage his pain and, at times, poor mental health, Mr Brazil also sourced additional medicines and drugs. He was able to buy from illegal websites, which depicted themselves as safe, regulated, online pharmacies. Mr Brazil died after inadvertently overdosing on benzodiazepines. They were not prescribed by his doctor or the NHS. Investigations by the police and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have found that these were bought by Mr Brazil from unlawful providers operating under these websites: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. Mr Brazil was able to buy prescription drugs from illicit providers on a regular basis; there are two A and E records in February and April 2022 of Mr Brazil being intoxicated on benzodiazepines, before he subsequently died from benzodiazepine toxicity in August 2022. Mr Brazil was struggling with physical pain and mental health issues and was susceptible to using this unlawful method, which was quick and readily available. On the last order made, the drugs were delivered the next day via Royal Mail. Evidence shows that Mr Brazil was not suicidal, but he was anxious to manage pain and was not directed by a healthcare professional as to how much to take and when.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) There are unregulated and unlawful websites offering prescription only medicines and controlled drugs, which look legitimate and are found easily from simple online searches; and these sites give rise to the following points (2) to (6) (2) Vulnerable and susceptible people are exposed to counterfeit or unsafe medications (3) There are insufficient or no measures to verify patient medical history before selling the medication and drugs (4) There is a lack of guidance regarding dosage (5) There are a lack of safeguards to prevent incorrect self-diagnoses or misuse by consumers (6) There is inadequate age and identity verification, potentially allowing minors to access restricted medicines and drugs (7) The fact that it is possible for unlawful and unethical online pharmaceutical providers to operate and deliver to the buyer within 24 hours means that these illegal websites may be more appealing to some than lawful sources. 6",45,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 rd . April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision. The medical cause of death was 1a Blunt Head Injury, including Basal Skull Fracture","These were recorded as follows: Martin Robert Saunders, aged 48, died on A4059 New Road Mountain Ash, on 17 th June 2023, which is a 60 mph road, with laybys and bends, locally described as a dangerous road. Martin's motorbike collided with a coach which had been making a right turn from a layby / parking area. A sweeping bend approaching the layby reduces visibility for those approaching or exiting it. Martin's motorbike was not visible to the driver when he began his manoeuvre and Martin's reaction time when faced with the coach was further reduced because he had been overtaking other vehicles on the approach to the layby. Despite best resuscitation efforts, Martin was declared deceased at the scene. Conclusion: Road Traffic Collision","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. The collision occurred on the A4059, New Road, Mountain Ash near the exit of a parking bay located on the east side of the carriageway. The parking area can be busy. At the time of the collision, the speed limit on the road was 60 mph and there was no prohibition on making right turns from the layby. The combination of reduced visibility due to the bends in the road, speed and right turns across the carriageway increases the risk of road traffic collisions. Changes are in progress to reduce the maximum speed limit but even allowing for this, I remain concerned there is a risk of future deaths occurring along this route unless action is taken, due to vehicles turning right across the carriageway from the layby on this stretch of road. 6",48,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of a three-day inquest on the 3 rd April 2025. Mrs Sitch died at Broomfield Hospital, Court Road, Chelmsford, Essex. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a [REDACTED] overdose . My Narrative Conclusion confirmed that Mrs Sitch (hereafter 'Linda') had taken her own life on a background of the impact upon her emotional and mental health well-being of looking after her elderly husband (with whom she had shared a long and happy marriage) and who, himself, suffered from significant on-going mental and physical health problems. The Narrative Conclusion included a summary chronology of the involvement of Adult Social Care with Linda over the last six weeks or so of life. During my summing-up, when providing my findings and determinations, I made it clear that the failings identified in the course of the inquest, although very possibly contributed to the death, I did not find, in the specific circumstances, that they were probably more than minimally causative of the death.","Linda's husband had been suffering from significant physical and mental health challenges for more than a year or so prior to her death; the impact of aspects of his initial presentation deeply affected Linda, to the extent that she attempted to take her own life on three occasions in October 2022. This led to her admission as a voluntary in-patient at a Mental Health facility under the care of Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT). She received a diagnosis of an 'Adjustment Disorder'. She was discharged to the care of the Community Mental Health Team in February 2023 and remained largely stable in her presentation through until the late summer of 2023. Her husband, having himself been detained under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983, was discharged back to the family home in June 2023. On 29 th September 2023 Linda's husband's EPUT Care Coordinator raised an Adult Safeguarding (ASG) concern with Essex County Council's Adult Social Care (ASC) regarding Linda's potential (unintentional) maladministration of her husband's medication. The referral contained details of Linda's own history of overdosing and the concerns of family members relating to Linda's presentation and her ability to care for her husband. By the time of her death on 11 th November, no action had been taken by ASC regarding this Safeguarding referral. On the 2 nd October 2023 a further referral was received from the same CPN requesting a Care Act (2014) Carer's Assessment for Linda. The referral again informed ASC that Linda was struggling with caring for John. Without apparently considering the ASG referral, this further referral was subsequently erroneously downgraded by the Community Team Manager from Priority 1 (requiring an immediate response) to Priority 2 (response within 28 days). The rationale for so doing was not recorded, as it should have been. By the time of her death no further action had been taken by ASC regarding the referral for a carer's assessment. On 16 th October further contact was made by Linda's daughter chasing up the 2 nd October referral, re-emphasising the escalating and serious family concerns regarding Linda's presentation, reiterating that Linda had attempted suicide the previous year and expressing concerns that Linda was exceptionally stressed and needed a break. As a consequence of (admitted) human error this information was not acted upon. Had it been reviewed the priority level would have been changed back to Priority 1 and there would have been immediate action, within 24 to 48 hours. Options would likely have included, inter alia , interim carers or residential respite. This would also have been an opportunity to establish if Linda had need in her own right. By the time of her death no further action had been taken by ASC regarding this additional contact . On 7 th November Linda's husband was admitted to Hospital for a medical issue; he was due to be discharged the following week. Prior to his discharge home, Linda took her own life.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern and in my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 3 a. Although not determined to be probably causative of the death, by the date of Linda's death ASC had failed to respond substantively or at all to the Adult Safeguarding Referral dated 29th September 2023; the referral for a Carer's Assessment for Linda herself, received by ASC on 2nd October 2023; the concerns reiterated by Linda's family when chasing the 2nd October referral on 16th October 2023. These failures were explained as 'human error'. b. The oral evidence of the ASC Service Manager at the inquest (though not mentioned in her statement prepared for the purposes of the inquest), confirmed that the Team Manager responsible for downgrading the Priority 1 status of the carer's assessment referral on 2nd October to Priority 2, without recording a rationale, had likely done so without undertaking the required consideration of either the readily available ASG referral of the 29th September, or the Mental Health Act assessment of Linda herself from the previous year. She agreed that, had an estimated “ten minute” review of the “slim files” for both Linda and her husband been undertaken, as should have happened, the Priority level could not and would not have been reasonably downgraded. She accordingly accepted that, in fact, (and contrary to her witness statement) the decision to downgrade to Priority 2 was capable of being determined, by her as an ASC Service Manager, to be 'inappropriate'. c. Nonetheless, the ASC Service Manager remained personally “reassured” that a change in Team Manager - along with reminders to personnel of best practice - had sufficiently addressed issues identified by the inquest proceedings. d. In contrast to this view, I remain concerned that ASC continues to lack a robust system to ensure sufficiently rigorous oversight, including active auditing, capable of identifying the kind of sub-optimal managerial level performance as has been brought to the fore in this case. A change in personnel and moves towards “embedding best practice” do not, in my opinion, sufficiently address this systemic lacuna given that the effectiveness of such changes will still rely very substantially upon the performance of any Team Manager and/or a Deputy Team Manager. There appears to me to be a continuing lack of robust Service level oversight of those managers themselves, (including the appropriateness of their decision making), absent which any sub-optimal performance by said managers may well not be identified. e. Absent a sufficiently robust system for providing oversight and identifying and significantly mitigating (if not entirely removing) such individual human error, alongside, for example, the inclusion of simple auditable check lists of matters to be accessed, reviewed and documented whenever a referral is received, then there is a continuing risk of urgent future referrals being inappropriately graded as Priority 2 (and/or being downgraded from Priority 1) without the requisite thorough and 4 professional review, adequately documented, being undertaken. This gives rise to a concomitant risk of future deaths. 6",75,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on17 April 2025, the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision The cause of death was bronchopneumonia due to multiple injuries, acute pulmonary thromboembolism (clots in the lung), hypertension and chronic heart failure and contributed to by osteopaenia, osteoarthritis, and atherosclerosis.","On 8 January 2023, Sheila Margaret Edwards was a front seat passenger in a car wearing a seatbelt. Shortly before the collision, the driver of the car was behaving slightly erratically slowing down when it was inappropriate to do so. As the car drove down Shawbridge Street, Clitheroe, the driver became unresponsive despite Sheila Edwards and another passenger shouting at him although he remained upright in his seat. The car accelerated to 50 mph. Sheila Edwards grasped the wheel and steered the car into the opposite carriageway to avoid stationary traffic. Unfortunately, this resulted in a head-on collision. After the collision it was noted that the driver was confused. On 3 June 2021 the driver had attended the Accident and Emergency Department following a 45-minute to loss of consciousness with no recollection of events during which he sustained a fall causing an abrasion to his forehead, a bruised lip and bit his tongue. He was noted to be slightly confused and a preliminary diagnosis was made of possibly a cardiovascular or neurological cause. At this time, it was unknown that the driver had mild-to-moderate dementia with good preservation of social skills and a particular deficit with his memory. The driver was referred to the medical team for assessment and gave a different history consistent with postural hypotension, which was the only abnormality detected on a bank of investigations. There was discussion between an expert in old age psychiatry expert neurologist as to whether or not the earlier or subsequent history was most reliable and on balance the earlier history was preferred. On 4 May 2022 the driver again attended the Accident and Emergency Department with another unexplained loss of consciousness that again was attributed to postural hypotension. The driver did not refer himself to the DVLA in respect of any of the above instances of collapse and was unaware of his mild-to-moderate dementia. The memory deficit due to the dementia made diagnosis of the underlying focal epilepsy particularly difficult due to the changing history provided to two different clinicians at different times. During the inquest it was noted that those who have no family or friends to report how they are behaving are particularly difficult to diagnose with dementia or any other cognitive deficit.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Dementia affects approximately half a million sufferers in the United Kingdom of which the DVLA has only been notified of approximately 30,000 drivers. It would appear that there is significant underreporting of drivers who may suffer from dementia . 2. The current system for vehicle licensing relies upon the self-awareness of a driver and their ability to self-report medical conditions to the DVLA. A system that relies upon the self-awareness of a person applying for a driving licence to self-report a medical condition of dementia where the condition itself is characterised by a lack of self-awareness is inherently unsafe and exposes other road users to the risk of death or serious injury. 3. The UK population is of increasing age and the number of older drivers is increasing rapidly. As dementia is an age-related condition, the number of dementia sufferers in the population and in the driving population is expected to increase. 4. As a result of the way in which collision data is collected using Stats 19, there is a significant likelihood that dementia is under recorded in collision statistics. The nation this point regarding collision data regarding the visual aspect of collisions, the PFD report into the deaths of Mary Cunningham, Grace Foulds, Anne Ferguson and Peter Westwell should be consulted. 5. In this case, the driver suffered from focal epilepsy, which was the primary cause of the collision resulting Sheila Edwards' death. However, the memory deficit caused by dementia resulted in a lack of awareness of an underlying neurological condition. In such cases there is a substantial risk that neither of the conditions will be reported to the DVLA for monitoring. The result is that a driver with two conditions that should be monitored by the DVLA who is both unaware of their illnesses and the need to report themselves to the DVLA. This creates a substantial risk to other road users. 6",81,N/A: Not found

The cause of death was multiple injuries and the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision; Grace Foulds , aged 85 years whose investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 April 2025. The cause of death was multiple injuries and the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision; Anne Elizabeth Ferguson aged 75 years whose investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 April 2025. The cause of death was multiple injuries and the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision; and Peter Anthony Westwell aged 80 years whose investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on17 April 2025. The cause of death was spinal column chest injuries and the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision","The four fatalities shared the same feature that the driver's sight was well below the standard required to drive a car with each driver had obtained a driving licence from the DVLA. Anne Ferguson was killed by a driver who was unable to see was driving due to severe bilateral cataracts that had developed over the previous 8 to 12 years. During this time the driver had never sought an optical assessment. A month before the collision, the driver attended a visual assessment with an optometrist and informed her that he did not drive. Consequently, the optometrist did not tell the driver that he should immediately stop driving. The driver drove every day for the next month before colliding with Anne Ferguson causing her death. The driver input necessary to avoid the collision was minimal. There were no other contributory factors to the collision other than the driver's very poor eyesight. The driver had repeatedly failed to self-report his condition, of which he was aware, on several licence applications to the DVLA. The DVLA, at the time of the collision, still licensed the driver to drive a car. Mary Cunningham and Grace Foulds died in a double fatal due to a driver who was unable to see due to severe bilateral keratoconus. In 2019 the driver was informed that his sight did not meet the legal standards for driving, after which the driver got into his car and drove home. The driver underwent corneal grafting to his right eye after which, never having been informed by any clinician involved in his care that his vision met the legal standards for driving, he self-assessed that his vision in his right eye was now sufficient for him to drive. It would have been obvious that the driver that the vision in his right eye remained worse than his left eye, which even with the contact lens was insufficient to meet the legal standards for driving. There were no other contributory factors to the collision other than the driver's very poor eyesight. The driver had repeatedly failed to self-report his condition, of which he was aware, as he considered that his obligation was only advisory rather than mandatory. The DVLA, at the time of the collision, still licensed the driver to drive a car. Peter Westwell was killed by a driver who had a long history of severe bilateral eye disease. In 1999 the driver was only able to reach the visual standard required to drive using glasses. However, in all subsequent police interviews and statements he always denied the need for glasses. In 2003 the driver had a right retinal detachment resulting in the loss of almost all detailed vision in the central field. In 2013 the driver developed wet macular degeneration in his left eye resulting in significant compromise to his central field of vision and at this time this vision did not meet the legal standards for driving. The driver was told on two separate occasions that he should not drive before he began to inform optometrists that he was a non-driver. The driver had repeatedly failed to self-report his condition, of which he was aware, on multiple licence applications to the DVLA. The DVLA, at the time of the collision, still licensed the driver to drive a car.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The licensing system for class I drivers is the laxest in Europe for the following reasons: • The UK is only one of five European countries to use a licence plate test (see below) for visual acuity testing • The UK and is only one of three countries to rely upon self-reporting of visual conditions affecting the ability to drive • The UK is the only country to issue a driving licence without any visual check for a continuous period of time that may be as much as 53 years A driver's visual acuity is only checked at the time of the driving test by reading a number plate at 20 m. A driver may then hold a licence until 70 years of age during which time there is no check that they meet the visual legal standards to drive a car. During this time a driver is required to self-monitor and self-refer visual conditions to the DVLA. During this time a variety of ocular diseases may develop, some of which are silent and of which the driver of which the driver may not be aware that that they are suffering from a disease that would compromise the driver's ability to comply with the legal standards to drive a car. 2. At 70 years of age and every three years thereafter, a driver self-reports on a licence application that they can read a number plate 20 m and have not been informed that their vision falls beneath the legal limit for driving. Over the age of 70 the incidence of diseases that affect the eye rises sharply and not all can be detected by the driver unless they undergo an ophthalmic assessment. There is no question of the renewal application as to whether or not the driver's visual fields are sufficient to meet the legal standards for driving. Visual fields can only be assessed by an ophthalmic assessment using specialist equipment. 3. Self-reporting of visual conditions permits drivers to lie about their current driving status to those performing an ophthalmic assessment and avoid warnings not to drive. Drivers may also admit they drive but then ignore instructions not to drive and fail to notify the DVLA. In such circumstances, when the DVLA becomes aware, the DVLA does not refer such cases to the police for prosecution and consequently drivers can lie without sanction. All three drivers in this case either lied concerning the driving status wilfully misinterpreted questions to avoid driving advice not to drive, adopted fictions of their visual performance to allow them to drive, prioritised their own enjoyment and independence over the lives of other road users and repeatedly obtained licences from the DVLA due to a defective self-reporting system that does not confirm the driver meets the visual legal standards for driving and is open to abuse. 4. Self-reporting of visual conditions affecting the driver's ability to meet the legal standards required to drive a car is unfit for purpose the following reasons: • Surveys of optometrists in the UK have reported that over half of the optometrists reported seeing a patient in the last month who, despite being told their vision was beneath the driving standard, indicated they would continue to drive. This would suggest approximately 56,000 drivers a year undergo a sight test confirms they do not reach the visual legal threshold to drive a car but will continue to do to so: • An independent survey of the public produced the following results: • 19% have had a collision either as a driver, passenger, pedestrian or cyclist with a motorist whom they believed had poor vision • 29% of motorists said they would continue to drive despite knowing their vision is below the legal standard • 33% of motorists would continue to drive as normal if visual test showed their vision had fallen beneath the legal standard • 26% said they are concerned about someone they know driving despite having poor vision • • Doctor/optometrist-patient medical confidentiality is an entrenched aspect of UK medical practice and is only rarely breached and this only occurs after protracted patient negotiations during which time a driver continues to drive their car. Unless there were to be some form of requirement for a driver's visual assessment that is believed the legal limit to be communicated to the DVLA, this safeguard by which the DVLA may be notified of a driver continue to drive against advice produces only a minimal number of cases each year. This is already known to the DVLA. • Between 2019 and 2023 there has been a collapse of drivers self- reporting the four major conditions of diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration resulting in a 70 to 76% reduction in notifications. As the diseases are unchanged, the patient cohort is unchanged and the DVLA have not altered their processes, the DVLA have no explanation for this substantial reduction in driver self-reporting over such a short period. This was not attributed to Covid during the inquest. In view of the importance of retaining a licence, the ease of licence renewal by either online or postal methods and the length of time since the Covid epidemic, Covid would be an unlikely explanation of the collapse • drivers who may have a degree of mild cognitive impairment or dementia may not be sufficiently self-aware to recognise visual deficiencies that compromise their ability to drive. • The UK's population is ageing with the number of drivers over the age of 70 increasing by approximately 250,000 drivers each year. As the changes to the eye and diseases that affect the eye predominantly affect those over 70, any existing problems will worsen in the medium term. 5. The 20 m licence plate test is a rough and ready roadside assessment of visual acuity. The 20 m licence plate test is unfit to accurately assess visual acuity to confirm that a driver meets the legal standard and makes no assessment of visual fields that are also a requirement. The European Council of Optometry and Optics in 2011 stated in respect of the 20 m licence plate test ""this practice is unacceptable as the licence plate is not performed under control conditions and the results are not directly comparable with the underlying European standards which specify an assessment of visual acuity"" and that member states using the licence plate test ""should do more to improve their system of addressing drivers' vision"". The UK took no action during the nine years it remained a member of the European Union. The Association of Optometrists and the College of, optometrists both expressed the views of their organisation that the licence plate test was a poor proxy for a sight test both in terms of the information provided and the fact that it provided no visual health check to detect undiagnosed ocular and general diseases that may affect a driver's ability to drive. The Secretary of State for Transport already supports the drivers over the age of 60 should take advantage of the free NHS sight tests to ensure that their vision meets the legal standards for driving. However, research shows that drivers, for unspecified reasons, are not taking up these tests. 6. The latest government figures record 1624 fatalities, 28,087 life changing serious injuries and 103,266 slight injuries accounting for 60,000 hospital admissions a year. Due to the Stats 19 data recording parameters, it is likely this is a substantial underestimate the actual number of road collisions from the National Travel Survey being approximately 600,000 and from the Department of Work and Pensions Compensation Recovery Unit 446,976. Data collection is further complicated by historical IT issues between constabularies resulting in a non- standardised reporting software. According to the Department for Transport uncorrected defective eyesight only occurred in 56 of the 15,355 road deaths recorded between January 2014 and January 2023, or 0.224% of all deaths. The evidence given at the inquest inferred that this figure was a significant underestimate of eyesight as a contributory factor in collisions for the following reasons: • other factors such as speed, wearing a seatbelt, using a mobile device or drink/drugs are easily ascertainable whereas defective vision is more difficult to detect, there must be a suspicion that it relates to an offence before a test can be made and the Stats 19 contributory factors usually are completed shortly after a collision when the full circumstances, including sight, may not be known • the College of Optometrists stated that the visual aspects of collisions are difficult to disentangle from other contributory factors • different constabularies approach to roadside testing is substantial such that over the same 10 year period Essex Constabulary remove the licences from 350 drivers was Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Cleveland, Derbyshire, Durham, Gloucestershire, Gwent, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and West Murcia constabularies between them only remove the licences of 112 drivers • the number of prosecutions for causing death by dangerous driving due to eyesight issues extrapolated from 34 constabularies give a figure of 95 deaths as opposed to the official figure of 56 for the same period • Estimates of drivers continuing to drive with vision that does not meet the legal standards from safety initiatives and older driver safety experts range from 1.7% to 5%. This equates to an active driving population site does not meet the legal limit of between 720,000 and 2.1 million licence holders. Any assurances given by the Secretary of State should bear in mind the limitations of the government statistics in their reply. 7. During the course of the inquest the following observations were offered by various bodies regarding mandatory site testing: • The view of the National Police Chief's Council was expressed by Commander as that it was ""much better not to let the risk (drivers with defective sight) onto the road and better for the police if the risk wasn't there in the first place"". Commander went on to express the view of the NPCC that they would ""fully support mandatory sight tests, but this was a decision for those in government"" • the College of Optometrists clinical adviser, explained that self-monitoring and self-referral was open to abuse by drivers who lie, the 20 m number plate test was both inadequate as a visual assessment of acuity and visual fields and that given the importance of the independence conferred by car driving there was considerable pressure on drivers to minimise any perceived visual deficits • the Association of Optometrists explained that the current system was flawed and the DVLA should require proof of eyesight before granting a driving licence. During the course of the inquest, it also became apparent that the Secretary of state for Transport has been forwarded to reports by the Older Drivers' Task Force in 2016 and 2021 recommending mandatory site testing. The Older Drivers' Task Force is a body partly funded by the Department for Transport. The above information is provided to assist the Secretary of State for Transport and is not a recommendation by the Coroner to the Secretary of State. 8. The Secretary of State, prior to the commencement of the inquest, confirmed in writing that she endorsed the comments of previous Secretaries set out in previous replies to Prevent Future Deaths reports. In response to PFD report concerning Louis Thorold, a five-year-old crushed to death by a driver with cognitive impairment, the then Secretary of State replied ""I must stress that one road death is one too many and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is focused on ensuring that only those who meet the required medical standards are granted a licence"". For the reasons given above, the current system for ""ensuring"" drivers meet the visual legal standards is ineffective, unsafe and unfit to meet the needs of society as evidenced by the deaths of Mary Cunningham, Grace Foulds, and Ferguson and Peter Westwell where the DVLA continued to provide licences to drivers who had failed to meet the legal sight requirements. 6",75,N/A: Not found

The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision The medical cause of death was recorded as: 1a Hypovolemic Shock with Multiorgan Failure 1b Massive Internal Haemorrhage from Visceral Injuries 1c Polytrauma from Road Traffic Collisions II Severe Left Ventricular Hypertrophy with Congestive Cardiac Failure,"At about 06.19 hours on Wednesday 16th October 2024,the Deceased was driving his Smart car to work travelling coastbound on the M20 motorway in Kent. He was unaccompanied and travelling in lane 2 of the 3 lane carriageway. He was following a Vauxhall Mokka car (Mokka) also travelling in lane 2. The vehicles were at or about Junction 1 at the Swanley interchange. The Deceased was travelling slightly faster than the Mokka vehicle and upon catching up with the Mokka. There was a collision between the front and front nearside of the Smart vehicle driven by the Deceased and the rear and rear offside of the Mokka. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate at speed. The Mokka was brought under control and stopped. The Smart car driven by the Deceased continued over the grass verge which separates the main carriageway of the M20 from the M25/M20, 2 carriageway slip road. The slip road carries traffic joining the M20 southbound from the M25 and is subject to the national speed limit of 70MPH. On crossing the grass verge the Smart car driven by the Deceased entered the slip road and was in collision with a BMW vehicle travelling in lane 2 of the slip road intending to join the M20 Motorway coastbound. The Smart car then travelled further in the eastbound direction re- entering the M20 in lane 1, stopping partly in lane 1 and the hard shoulder. As a result of injuries sustained in the collisions Mr Slater sadly died at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) The grass verge which separates the M20 and M25/ M20 slip road does not have erected upon it any physical barriers to prevent traffic crossing the verge from either of the 2 roads referred to and entering a parallel lane the opposite side of the verge. (2) The evidence received from National Highways confirmed that under the present policy guidance, barriers would not normally be required as there are no features such as an incline on the slip road, bridge supports or trees requiring physical protection between the two merging roads of traffic travelling at similar speeds in the same direction. (3) The facts of the present case illustrate that in the event of a loss of control of a vehicle travelling on either the M20 or in the slip road there is the potential for that vehicle, without any warning to drivers travelling at or about the same area in the coastbound direction, cross the grass verge to their side and enter their lane of travel. As both the material roads are subject to the same national speed limit of 70MPH, the risk of a high speed collision and fatality arises. 6.",27,N/A: Not found

The Chief Executive, Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 1","On 9.11.23 , I commenced an investigation into the death of Mrs Marina May Raisbeck. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 16 th January 2025 The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative as follows: Marina Raisbeck, known as May, died from sepsis, secondary to a perianal abscess, on 7.11.23 at the Doncaster Royal Infirmary (DRI). Whilst initial treatment was provided for sepsis on admission to Bassetlaw District General Hospital (BDGH) on the evening of 4.11.23, there was a delay in her reaching BDGH on that day, and then there was a further delay in transfer to the DRI for planning of the necessary Incision and Drainage of the abscess. Over the hospital admission period, her kidney function worsened, and the necessary surgery to drain the abscess on 6.11.23, also had an impact on her physiological status. Whilst these issues of delay are serious, it is not possible to say that on balance they have caused or made a more than minimal, negligible or trivial contribution to her death, both because of the extent of her underlying frailty, and the seriousness of the infection that she faced.","Marina May Raisbeck, known as May, died on 7.11.23, at the Doncaster Royal Infirmary, Doncaster, South Yorkshire. May was aged 82 at the time of her death. She had a number of significant chronic medical problems, that were being managed, including Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, (with a recent hospital admission), Chronic Kidney Disease, Ischaemic Heart Disease (leading to heart failure), and obstructive sleep apnoea. She also had morbid obesity. There was a RESPECT form in place from July 2023. May also had wound healing difficulties with leg and abdominal wounds managed by the District Nurse team. She was housebound, with an Exercise Tolerance of 5- 10 yards. May developed a red painful lump on her buttock at the end of October 23. She was seen on 1.11.23, and prescribed an antibiotic, Doxycycline. It is unclear whether this was prescribed for a possible chest or water infection. It was an unusual choice for a skin infection/evolving abscess. She was seen again on 3.11.23 and the abscess was clearly noted. It was not painful, but discharging. She was appropriately prescribed Flucloxacillin, and a District Nursing team referral made. There were no signs of sepsis on either of these occasions. On the morning of 4.11.23, she was seen by a District Nurse, who provided a dressing. No observations were taken at this appointment but May was not described as systemically unwell. Also on 4.11.23, the family had contacted the Out of Hours (OOH) service, 111, at 09.14 hours, as the 4th was a Saturday. A call back from a clinician from the Bassetlaw OOH GP service occurred at 15.27 hours- it is unclear what happened between the initial call, and the clinician call back, with May's daughter reporting a further call to the 111 service to follow up following the first call. The telephone assessment established that the abscess was now larger (5x5cm reported), and that it was red and painful. There was insufficient exploration of other systemic symptoms of infection, and this assessment should have resulted in a face to face assessment within 2 hours , rather than 6 hours as was arranged. May was then seen by a OOH GP at 19.51 hours on 4.11.23. May was identified as unwell at this point, though with normal temperature, pulse and blood pressure. This appropriately resulted in an ambulance transfer to BDGH, arriving at 21.13 hours. A nurse triage assessment followed at 21.49, where it was recognised May likely had sepsis- she now had a fever, with a low blood pressure of 95/39, a high breathing rate of 25 breaths per minute (though her breathing rate was often high at rest), pulse of 88/minute, just within the normal range. She was given a fluid bolus and IV antibiotics at 22.45, and a diagnosis of an abscess, requiring incision and drainage was made. She was accepted under the surgical team at the DRI (surgery not available at BDGH at the weekend), at 02,00am on 5.11.23. Thereafter, whilst May remained reasonably stable, her fluid balance was not recorded, and there was no repeat blood tests to monitor her lactate, and her kidney function, as should have occurred. She required two fluid boluses to improve her blood pressure, at 11.38 hours and 15.18 hours on 5.11.23 at BDGH. May was finally transferred to DRI on the evening of 5.11.23, and then incision and drainage were appropriately delayed until the morning of 6.11.23, as she was a high anaesthetic risk, and it was appropriate to delay until sufficient daytime staff were available. During surgery, which was completed appropriately, she had a period of 30-40 minutes of low blood pressure, despite treatment. Post operatively she remained drowsy. Over the subsequent 24 hours she developed worsening acute kidney injury. On the evening of 7.11.23 she had a cardiac arrest, and died shortly after. It is possible that earlier incision and drainage, on 5.11.23, would have led to a different outcome for May, but in light of her extensive medical issues leading to significant frailty, and the rapid progression of the perianal abscess leading to sepsis, despite appropriate treatment from the evening of 4.11.23, it is unlikely. There was no discussion between the Emergency Department medical team at BDGH, and the surgical team at the DRI, to consider prioritising May for transfer during 5.11.23, nor any agreed process for easy review of May's clinical parameters to again make an appropriate decision as to any need for more urgent transfer from BDGH to the DRI.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The lack of a system for prioritisation of urgent surgical patients awaiting transfer to DRI from the Emergency Department at Bassetlaw District General Hospital 2. The lack of a system for monitoring clinical parameters of urgent surgical patients awaiting transfer to DRI from the Emergency Department at Bassetlaw District General Hospital I am not reassured that necessary actions to address these serious issues identified are in place. 6,82,N/A: Not found

Department of Health and Social Care 3. Home Office 4. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office 1",On 24 August 2024 the Coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Abdulrahman ALAJMI. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: Natural Causes exacerbated by travel for treatment,"The Medical Certificate of the Cause stated the following: 1a) Multiorgan Failure b) septic shock (Acinetobacter baumennii) c) infected left leg wound and ischaemic left leg 2 ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease On 7 August 2024 at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, London, Abdulrahman AlAjmi died from multiorgan failure (as set out in the medical cause of death). He had arrived in the UK for medical treatment on 24 July 2024 in a much poorer medical condition than had been outlined by the referring hospital, as he had deteriorated three days before he flew without the receiving hospital being notified of that. He was on a ventilator and bleeding, neither of which had been indicated to the receiving hospital or ambulance which transferred him from the plane to the hospital. Despite appropriate medical treatment being given in the UK, he did not recover. I found that it is probable that the flight contributed to his death by exacerbating his very serious pre-existing medical conditions. The evidence also indicated that patients who come to the UK for treatment from overseas often arrive in a worse condition than anticipated, which means that receiving hospitals and ambulances may not always be equipped to treat the patient appropriately (as they have accepted the referral on the basis of a different medical condition).","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. — 1. In the course of the evidence it was confirmed that there is no set procedure regarding the acceptance by hospitals in the UK of patients for treatment from other countries. 2. It was stated in evidence that patients often arrive in a substantially different (often worse) condition to that described to the receiving clinicians when they accepted the referral and agreed that they were able to provide treatment. This means that UK health providers may receive for treatment individuals who are more unwell than anticipated, potentially requiring expertise that is not held by the receiving treatment providers (albeit in this case they had an ICU team who were able to provide the necessary treatment). 3. The evidence provided showed that it is up to each individual hospital to determine whether they are willing and able to accept a referral and agree the process for transfer of the patient. The evidence indicated that that process is not uniform and relies heavily on the accuracy of the information received from the referring medical staff, as well as it being appropriately updated should circumstances change. 4. The evidence indicated that it is the decision of the medical staff in the country that the patient is coming from whether, and with what medical support, a patient can travel to come to the UK. That is not within the control of the UK. However, the process by which hospitals in the UK accept referrals from other countries and the provision of visas (and any conditions attached to them) for those individuals to enter the UK for that treatment is within the control of the UK. 5. The evidence showed an absence of systems or structures to ensure that patients arriving in the UK for medical treatment are able to be received (by the ambulance transferring them and the hospital treating them) safely and be properly treated: with a full understanding of the accurate and up to date medical position. 6. The evidence leads to a concern that patients are being put at risk, leading to the possibility of future deaths occurring, and that the UK's health services are put under unnecessary strain by receiving patients who are more unwell than anticipated when a referral is accepted. 7.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 April 2025. I made a determination at inquest of accidental death.","Ms Cunningham jumped down onto the northbound track at Chalk Farm London Underground Station at approximately 3.30am on Saturday, 2 November 2024 and walked into the tunnel. She was killed by a train 18 minutes later. Although she jumped down onto the track rather than falling, she did not form the intention to take her own life. She jumped onto the track because she was intoxicated by a combination of alcohol, cocaine and ketamine, and was only a sporadic user of drugs on a recreational basis.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I heard evidence at inquest that London Underground passenger intoxication is recognised as a risk to London Underground staff. Extreme intoxication is also known to be a risk to the individual who is intoxicated. However, it struck me that the risk to the individual is not necessarily at the forefront of TfL corporate thinking. Clearly, individuals have responsibility for their own drinking and/or drug taking and the consequences thereof. Intoxication carries additional risk whatever the activity. However, public transport is encouraged for many good reasons. Not least, it is a matter of public policy that those who are or may become intoxicated should make travel plans that do not involve being in charge of a vehicle. The London Underground is an obvious alternative. Realistically, some London Underground passengers will be intoxicated, and that has to inform TfL's corporate planning. I heard that there was a TfL investigation following Sarah Cunningham's death, but the learning from that appears at present to be somewhat aspirational, without a concrete plan. 6",31,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10th April 2025 . The conclusion of the inquest was; Died from natural causes likely due to complications associated with her reduced mobility after an operation to stabilize a fracture.,"On 1st October 2024, Iris, who had a complex medical history and a previous above knee amputation of her right leg, suffered a fall at home, sustaining a peri prosthetic fracture of her left distal femur. On 2nd October, she underwent a successful operation at the QEH in Birmingham to stabilize her fracture but her recovery including getting her back to her baseline mobility was affected by pain and by her developing a chest infection for which she was treated with a course of anti-biotics. On 27th October 24 once medically fit for discharge, she was transferred to the Ann Marie Howes inpatient Rehabilitation Unit where she received further treatment including for a Grade 4 pressure sore to her left heel which had developed during her inpatient stay at the QEH but which was not noted on the QEH inpatient records. Unfortunately, on 5th November she developed pneumonia and was admitted urgently to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital. She received treatment there for her pneumonia including IV antibiotics and although her condition initially stabilized, she suffered a significant and swift deterioration on 8th November, passing away that day in hospital. Based on information from the Deceased's treating clinicians the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Hospital Acquired Pneumonia 1b 1c 1d II Recent Periprosthetic Fracture Stabilisation of Left Distal Femur (Operated 02/10/2024)","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. On her arrival at the Ann Marie Howes Rehabilitation Unit on 27th March 2024 Iris was assessed and found to have a Grade 4 Pressure Sore on her left heel which I was satisfied must have been present prior to her discharge the same day from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. 2. I heard evidence during the inquest that Iris was at heightened risk of developing pressure sores given her co-morbidities and reduced mobility post her operation and that a Grade 4 pressure sore is the most serious type of pressure sore where bone is exposed and can therefore be at risk of infection. 3. However, apart from one entry on 13th October 2024 in the QEH electronic in patient noting records when it was recorded that Iris was complaining of pain on palpation of her left heel and a pillow was placed under her heel, there is no reference in the noting to it having been observed at any point that Iris had developed a pressure sore to her left heel during her admission at the QEH. 4. This leads to a concern that either the skin to her left heel was not being properly inspected or if it was that such inspections were not adequately noted in the electronic in-patient noting. 6",65,N/A: Not found

Mrs Lakin experienced a progressive decline of her mobility and started to fall out of her armchair, her family purchased an “armchair lap belt” to prevent the falls. On 19 February 2023 Mrs Lakin slid down her armchair and under the lap belt, it became caught around her neck and she died as a result.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Pre-amble Mrs Lakin was a 72 year old female who was diagnosed with Corticobasal Syndrome which caused a progressive decline in both her mobility and memory. In 2023 Mrs Lakin started to have carers to support her at home. Her mobility continued to deteriorate and she started to use a wheelchair, she also started to fall out of bed at night and fall out of her armchair. Concerned about Mrs Lakin falling out of her armchair her family went onto the internet and found for sale an “armchair belt” which they purchased on 8 December 2023 and fitted to Mrs Lakin's armchair on 9 December 2023. The belt was used without issue until Mrs Lakin died on 19 February 2024. CCTV cameras captured Mrs Lakin slipping down her armchair and underneath the lap belt which then becomes caught around her neck. Mrs Lakin was unable to self-rescue by mobilising in the way that some people might be able to and therefore remained trapped, and effectively suspended by the lap belt around her neck, until she was found by a family member who visited her. Mrs Lakin died shortly after she was found. A post mortem report has confirmed the cause of Mrs Lakin's death to be 1a) Respiratory compromise by support belt, 1b) Postural impairment, 1c) Corticobasal syndrome and atypical Parkinson's disease. Concerns Mrs Lakin's family purchased the lap belt with good intentions, they wanted to keep Mrs Lakin safe. The advertisement and sales particulars for the lap belt that they purchased states “fits any armchair”, that it provides “extra support to prevent accidents” and finally that it provides “adequate trunk stability avoiding lateral displacements and slides” and “minimises the chance that the patient will… suffer any injuries, tilting or slipping”. The advertisement and sales particulars contain no warning about the risks that are associated with the use of the lap belt, nor any suggestion that the lap belt should be used or fitted under the guidance/supervision of a therapist or medical professional. The evidence heard at the inquest was that the lap belt should be considered a “high risk” piece of equipment (it is categorised as such in the local NHS Trust's Standard Operating Procedure) and that appropriate warnings should be given to those purchasing lap belts in relation to the risks of physical restraint, tissue viability risks and finally the risk of strangulation. It is concerning that people who have no healthcare training at all can purchase high risk equipment for their loved ones online without being appraised of those risks or even being informed about the high risk nature of the equipment. Lap belts, and other seemingly basic pieces of healthcare equipment, are readily available for people to purchase online without them being appraised of the risks that come with the use of the same. 6",72,N/A: Not found

There were communication difficulties experienced by Jonathan's family and his supported housing with the community mental health trust responsible for his ongoing healthcare during the early part of 2024. Telephone calls and text messages were unanswered and there was no communication to confirm that in fact the care co-ordinator had a period of annual leave followed by an unplanned period of sick leave. It was unclear at inquest if service users and their support network had been provided with details of any service changes and current up to date contact details. This meant that important information was not being received by the community mental health team. 2. The community mental health team actively encouraged communication by text message and emails but had no system in place to intervene when the care co-ordinator was not at work and had left no “out of office” message. There was no system to return or redirect incoming calls or messages so these remained unread and unanswered. Those initiating the communication were unaware that the information was not being received or actioned by the Trust. 3. Jonathan's case was not “zoned” that is, given a priority coding on the case management system. Therefore, there was no expected period for case review or regularity of expected contact. The multi-disciplinary meetings and supervision meetings when Jonathan's case was discussed failed to recognise and address this issue. Appropriate zoning and regular reviews are a fundamental part of mental health care and should be embedded and prioritised as part of each patient's care planning. 6",32,N/A: Not found

Mr Ineson was a keen participant in organised open water swimming events with safety at the forefront of his mind with a reasonable expectation that appropriate safety measures would be in place for Page 2 of 3 an organised event. He attended such an event on 31st May 2023 which was well attended, and the organisers indicated that this had been a popular event when it had taken place. This event, like many similar events, charged participants a small fee for the session. The matters of concern were not found to be causative of Mr Ineson's death but were such that there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. I was concerned that the evidence highlighted uncertainty and confusion with regard to responsibility for aspects of safety measures leading to some participants not receiving a specific safety briefing, a lack of knowledge of the competency/capability of each and every participant and no understanding as to who was in the water and how many people were in the water at any one time. It became clear in evidence that the activity does not require a licence from the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority and can be undertaken and/or organised by anyone without regulation. Some organisations provide guidance on safety when organising such events, but there is no established UK body that provides regulation for this activity. It was confirmed there is no specific health and safety guidance, nor is there a regulatory compliance requirement regarding pre-session safety briefing, risk assessments, signing in and out of the water systems, emergency plans and/or training for organisers. The evidence indicated there is no oversight of these events which, by definition, take place in outdoor locations that may pose a risk. I shall be glad to be told of any learning arising from this death and timescales and results of your review. 6",55,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10th March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Accidental death. The medical cause of death was 1a) Concomitant Dihydrocodeine and Pregabalin Toxicity.,"On 25th October 2024, Robert Leighton Smith was found unresponsive at his home address, [REDACTED]. He was on high levels of prescribed painkillers for pain. He had a history of mental health difficulties and was on the waiting list for Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). Police found no suspicious circumstances and no evidence of third party involvement in his death. A post mortem included toxicology. He was found to have above therapeutic levels of his prescribed medication in his system",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The inquest was told that Mr Leighton –Smith had been assessed as someone who would gain a real benefit from IPT. However he had not started it at the time of his death due to a significant waiting list. This was caused by the demand for the service being far higher than the capacity. The evidence was that at the time of the inquest the waiting time for IPT was on average 12 months. This was due to the ongoing demand against commissioned capacity. The inquest was also told that IPT was not an outlier in relation to its waiting time and that the backlog for all other therapy type services were at a similar level. The consequence of such prolonged waits was that people were having to wait a long time for mental health therapy support that they had been identified as requiring. The Trust GMMH indicated they provided the services they were commissioned to provide but unless the additional services were commissioned they could not increase their provision and waiting lists would remain high. 6,0,N/A: Not found

The Directors Lukka Care Homes Limited Macneil House 9 – 17 Lodge Lane London N12 8JH 1,"On 11 October 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Ivy May DIXON, aged 96 years at the time of her death. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard by me on 28 January and 28 March 2025. I conclusion of the inquest was a short narrative conclusion. The medical cause of death was: 1a asphyxia 1b choking on food II essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus","The circumstances of Mrs Dixon's death are encapsulated within the narrative conclusion from the Inquest, which was as follows: “Ivy Dixon choked on food causing cardiac arrest while being fed by staff in her room at Acorn Lodge Care Home on 6 October 2024. Carers called an ambulance but did not perform CPR when Mrs Dixon became unresponsive prior to an ambulance arriving. Mrs Dixon had a DNACPR order in place, which would not apply to an episode of choking. This is because choking is a potentially reversible cause of cardiac arrest. Care staff told the paramedics that Mrs Dixon had not been fed that evening. This was not true. This led paramedics to conclude that Mrs Dixon's cardiac arrest did not have a reversible cause. It is unclear whether, if paramedics had been given a correct account of events, the outcome would have been any different.”","During the course of my investigation and the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are, as follows: 1. The healthcare assistant who had been with Mrs Dixon on the evening of 6 October 2024, clearly referred in her statement to the patient having been fed. Shortly thereafter the healthcare assistant heard “a noise” coming from the patient's chest and so she called for the assistance of a nearby nurse. Two nurses attended and made the reasonable assumption that the patient was choking. Treatment was administered and a set of vital observations showed that the patient's oxygen saturations were 87%. On this basis, nursing staff called for an emergency ambulance: the London Ambulance Service (LAS) call handler was told that the patient was “choking” albeit she was breathing and conscious at that time. Despite this, once LAS staff arrived at Acorn Lodge Care Home, the Care Home staff told paramedics that they had been attempting to feed the patient, but the patient started to gasp before any food was given to her, meaning they were unable to feed her. This raises concerns about the communication and integrity of the staff members at the Care Home in their provision of care to the patient. I did not receive any reassurance that this concern has been addressed. 2. While the patient was breathing and conscious at the time of the 999 call, when LAS staff attended six minutes later, the patient was not conscious, not breathing, had no palpable pulse, and was critically unwell in confirmed cardiac arrest. However, despite this, staff from the Care Home were not undertaking CPR. The DNACPR would not have applied in this case, because choking is a potentially reversible cause of cardiac arrest, which the Care Home's manager confirmed in her evidence. This raises the concern that staff (healthcare assistants and nursing staff) at the Care Home may have previously unidentified training needs and/or lacked the clinical skills/knowledge to provide emergency care. 6",96,N/A: Not found

The investigation is ongoing at the present time but following a post mortem a provisional cause of death has been established as being 1(a) Blunt force head injuries.,"The circumstances of the death are as follows : On the 6th of April 2024 the deceased was a pillion passenger on a motorcycle which was travelling in the direction of Nantwich along the A534. As the motorcycle approached the junction for Holt village, it collided with a motor vehicle which appears to have been exiting the junction. As a result of this collision the deceased sustained injuries which were incompatible with life and she was verified dead at the scene.","In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Following discussions with the Roads Traffic Policing Unit of North Wales Police, I am concerned that although at this location the A534 is a comparatively straight stretch road, the visibility from the junction when turning right out of the village in the direction of Wrexham may on occasions be obstructed by signage and/or by vehicles which are slowing to turn into the village. Furthermore as this straight stretch of road is subject to a national speed limit following a 40 mph zone, traffic may be accelerating or travelling at speed, thus creating risk both for persons exiting the junction and traffic which is continuing along the main road. It is also my understanding that there have been previous collisions in this vicinity in the past. Coroner's Office, County Hall, Wynnstay Road, Ruthin, LL15 1YN Tel 01824 708047 | Unless action is taken to improve visibility, reduce the speed of traffic or to alter the road layout, then there is an ongoing risk that further collisions will occur and that lives may be lost as a result. 6",43,N/A: Not found

Care Quality Commission","On 26th June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Bernard Lyon. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5th March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Narrative: Died from the complications of aspiration pneumonia which developed as a consequence of aspiration of food whilst resident of a nursing home. The medical cause of death was 1a) Aspiration Pneumonia II) Dementia, Frailty, Myocardial Fibrosis and Cardiomegaly.","Bernard Lyon was placed on a modified diet as a consequence of his dysphagia. He moved to Hyde Nursing Home on 4th January 2024 as he needed full time care due to his needs. Unknown to his family Hyde Nursing Home was subject to a quality improvement action plan. It is probable his family would not have chosen the home had they known about the concerns of the quality improvement team. A multiagency meeting in December did not fully consider the risks presented by the audit of the home.
As a consequence, the home was permitted to continue to accept new residents. It is probable that if the position had been fully discussed at the December meeting, the home would not have been permitted to accept new residents. Bernard Lyon would probably not have been resident. Whilst resident at Hyde Nursing Home, Bernard Lyon's modified diet care plan was not always adhered to by staff. This was due to a shortage of managers and communication issues between the management team and staff.
On 22nd January he attended Tameside General Hospital. He was found to be very unwell with sepsis. There was a delay in giving antibiotics as a consequence of the volume of patients in the Emergency Department at the time. He was treated for aspiration pneumonia. He deteriorated despite active treatment and was placed on end-of-life care. On 30th January 2024 he died at Tameside General Hospital. A postmortem examination found he had microscopic traces of food in his lungs and that had probably led to him developing aspiration pneumonia.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –
1. The care home in question was recognised as having too few managers for it to be effectively managed but was allowed to continue to operate and was seeking to expand

2. The home relied on agency staff who the inquest was told struggled to have sufficient grasp of the English language to understand instructions given and to communicate with residents.

3. The inquest was told that the Local Authority regularly held MAC meetings to look at care home issues from a multi-agency perspective. The CQC was invited but rarely attended the meetings. As a consequence, the flow of information to the CQC was reduced.

4. The inquest was told that there was no process to let a family know of concerns that agencies had about a care home or that it was subject to an improvement plan. This meant that families were being left to make decisions about where to place family members unaware of the actual situation and concerns.

5. The evidence given to the inquest indicated significant delays in the handover from the ambulance to the ED team. This was due to pressure on the ED but meant that ambulances were tied up for longer than necessary and then had a knock-on impact on the ability of the ambulance service to respond to calls. The inquest was told that TGH had made efforts to improve the turnaround time, and it was currently at just an average time of 23.22 minutes. There was further evidence that TGH were not unusual amongst hospitals in the Northwest with the turnaround time at other hospitals running at over 1 hour.

6. The Emergency Department at TGH was extremely busy on the day Mr Lyon arrived which was not unusual. The sheer volume of patients who were seriously ill meant that there was a delay in him being given antibiotics in accordance with his need. The Trust had taken steps to address this, but it was accepted that where there was a significant demand on an ED compliance with the national sepsis guidance was far more difficult to achieve.

7. The inquest was told that the build-up of patients and levels of demand in the ED at TGH were not unusual and continued. As an illustration of the ongoing nature of the demand in recent months one patient has waited in ED for 3 days for a bed. The delay in transfer was due to an ongoing demand for beds and delayed discharges of patients medically optimised but with no suitable non acute/community provision being available.",81,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Narrative Conclusion – Ruth Ann PINGREE was described by her family as an amazing person. Someone who had a quality about them that drew you to her with her smile, her laugh, her heart, her vulnerability and her brilliant mind. She was a person who would make you feel loved and valued and appreciated. A one in a million. A person who was always there for her family and friends and utterly devoted to her children. On the 22nd July 2022, Mrs. Pingree, her husband and two children travelled from their home in Surrey to Suffolk where they had planned to spend time with friends holidaying in a caravan park. There were about seven families in total who travelled separately to the Happy Days Retro Vacation caravan site in Saxmundham, Suffolk. The party arrived during the evening of the 22nd July 2022. The Happy Days Retro Vacation caravan site was comprised of seven Airstream caravans arranged around various outbuildings which provided shower and toilet facilities. The caravans were made from an aluminium outer skin built on a wooden frame and steel chassis. Each caravan was named. The caravan occupied by the Pingree family was called 'Betsy'. On the evening they arrived Mr. Pingree had briefly watched parts of an online video prepared by Happy Days Retro Vacations and which was intended to orientate guests to the caravan they would occupy and how particular aspects of the caravan operated. The video did not include a safety brief nor did the Pingree's receive a safety brief on arrival at the Happy Days Retro Vacation site. The caravan 'Betsy' was fitted with a dual smoke and carbon monoxide detector and which was fixed to a wall in the kitchen area of the caravan. In addition, a fire blanket was affixed to a wall near the stove in the kitchen area and a small fire extinguisher was also located in the kitchen area. Having arrived during the evening of Friday the 22nd July 2022, the Pingree's and their friends socialised outside near a fire pit before retiring for the evening. On Saturday the 23rd July 2022 the party enjoyed a day out travelling to Aldeburgh before returning later in the afternoon. As with the previous evening, the party socialised outside their caravans during the evening with the last person retiring at approximately 23:30 hours. As had been the case the previous evening, a fire pit had been used and several of the adult members of the group had smoked cigarettes. Adult members of the group had also consumed alcohol. A security check of the site by the owner at around 00:30 hours on the morning of the 24th July 2022 revealed nothing untoward with no sign of a fire other than a few glowing embers in the fire pit. The weather at the time had been exceptionally dry with above average (hotter) temperatures for the time of year. It was also windy on the evening of the 23rd July 2022. At some point approximately between 00:30 hours and 04:30 hours on the 24th July 2022 a smouldering fire started outside the bathroom end of the caravan 'Betsy' which the Pingree's were occupying. It is not possible to say whether this was started from an ember blowing out of the fire pit or from a discarded match or cigarette butt. The fire was not started due to an electrical fault. The fire developed over a period of time engaging the external structure of the caravan. The effect of this development meant that the external aluminium cladding of the caravan heated causing the door frame of the sole caravan door to become warped and made the door inoperable; in effect jammed shut. At some time between 04:00 and 04:30 hours Mr. Pingree was woken by his son who alerted him to the fact that there was a fire. At this point there was smoke in the caravan and the fire had started to engage the inside of the bathroom end where the children had been sleeping. The smoke detector fitted in the caravan had not activated and did not sound during the fire. Mr. Pingree sought to open the caravan door which had been left unlocked, but was unable to due to the effect of the fire on the door mechanism. A friend who had been staying in the adjacent caravan and who had become aware of the fire also tried to open the door to 'Betsy' unsuccessfully. Turning to the right and away from the door and facing his family who were in the kitchen area of the caravan, Mr. Pingree realised that quick action was required in order to escape the caravan. The fire was fully engaging the bathroom end of the caravan at this point and the entire space had quickly become full of acrid dark smoke. Mr. Pingree then used his body to force open the window above the sink in the kitchen area and climbed outside. He was followed by his two children. Mrs. Pingree had remained to assist the children in their escape. Her actions in doing so meant that the children were able to escape the burning caravan. Sadly Mrs. Pingree was not able to escape the caravan and shortly after the second child escaped, the caravan became engulfed in fire and smoke. Desperate efforts to extinguish the fire by those present were unsuccessful and it was not until the Fire Service arrived at 04:45 hours that the fire was finally extinguished. By this point Mrs. Pingree had sadly perished in the fire. Had the fire alarm functioned it is likely that this would have been before the Pingree's son had raised the alarm. It is not possible however to say if this would have meant Mrs. Pingree would have escaped the caravan before being overcome by the fire fumes. A postmortem examination of Mrs. Pingree's body established that her medical cause of death was due to the inhalation of fire fumes. Investigation of the cause of the fire established that the source of the fire was not due to an electrical fault, but rather either an ember blowing from a nearby fire pit or a discarded cigarette/match. This caused a smouldering fire to develop over a period of time outside the caravan and which then engulfed the caravan. Ruth Ann PINGREE died as a result of the effects of a fire in a caravan she was holidaying in and which started due to accidental causes. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a. Inhalation of fire fumes",See Narrative Conclusion above,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The Inquest heard evidence concerning the operation of the Regulatory Reform Fire Safety Order 2005 (FSO). In assessing the actions by owners/proprietors of businesses such as Happy Days Retro Vacations for compliance with the FSO, there is a general test of suitability and sufficiency applied in relation to measures undertaken by the relevant responsible person/entity (proprietors) to comply with the FSO. This does not require that the proprietors: . keep any written records; . set a specific interval of maintenance inspections; or . provide any signage or safety notices in caravans indicating escape routes or actions in case of emergency. There would not appear to be any set guidance or format for the conduct of a risk assessment, what this must cover nor how often they should be conducted. Proprietors, who under the FSO, are responsible for carrying out risk assessments are provided within the FSO with a general set of requirements that need to then be considered as to applicability to any given activity. The means to understand and interpret the requirement is reliant upon the research ability of those charged with undertaking the risk assessment. Guidance documents such as the Paying Guest Guide do exist and outline best practice steps, however these are not included in the FSO as minimum standards a responsible person/entity is required to take. The potential for short cuts and misunderstandings are substantial. This is within a framework of assurance and enforcement that would appear to be ad hoc. This is in the context of businesses providing accommodation to the public on a paid basis. There is a lack of clear standards concerning what fire safety measures are required, how to assess what is to be applied, how to achieve that standard, and the assurance and enforcement mechanisms beyond this. 6",42,N/A: Not found

Royal College of Radiology 1",On the 9 th January 2018 an investigation was commenced into the death on the 26 th December 2017 of Christian James Gabriel Hobbs (aged 17 years). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 14 th October 2024 and some key determinations were :- Medical Cause of Death : 1a. Multi Organ Failure 1b. Cardiogenic Shock 1c. Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy Conclusion: Died from complications following an acute deterioration having decompensated over a short period of time on a background of a previously undiagnosed pre-existing arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.,"1. Christian had no known relevant past medical history. He was at school and had a passion for and love of boxing from a young age. He was a member of a boxing club. His father, who had served for 10 years as an infantry officer in the Army said that he had seen fit men, but Christian was amongst the fittest he had seen. 2. The Christmas period in 2017 had led to a large gathering at the family home in Northamptonshire. On Christmas day, Christian seemed fine before lunch and a photograph had been taken. He was said to have been in good form over lunch but went inside as he was not feeling well. It was not considered that he had anything other than a suspicion of flu. 3. When checked the following day, he seemed much the same at circa 12 noon and he was adamant he still wanted to go on holiday. He had taken paracetamol and Ibuprofen. He was checked again in the late afternoon and his mother then asked his grandfather (a retired Consultant) to look at him because of some concerning features. His grandfather found his conscious level to be 'tenuous'. He considered him to be clammy and shut down. The radial pulse was not palpable and the carotid pulse was circa 240. He considered Christian was morbidly white and had no capillary return. 4. As a result, Christian's parents urgently transported him by car to the City Hospital, Peterborough. Christian told his mother on the journey that his heart had been going fast since after lunch the previous day and had a sound of rushing blood in his ears like he had been on a long run. 5. His grandfather telephoned the hospital and spoke to a receptionist and pre- warned about his arrival and relayed concerns about the heart rate, the poor perfusion and 'the prejudiced cardiac output'. ADMISSION TO PETERBOROUGH CITY HOSPITAL 26/12/2017 6. Christian was documented as having arrived in the Emergency Department (ED) at 17:42. 7. Christian was seen by the assessment nurse on recorded entries at circa 17:45 where the presenting complaint was documented as?AF/?SVT. It was also documented that Christian had complained of chest tightness and vomiting and that he had already taken paracetamol and ibuprofen. 8. Observations documented a heart rate of 159 (with a recorded entry of 240 also), a blood pressure of 91/71 respiratory rate 17, SpO2 100% and Glasgow Coma Score 15. It was documented that Christian 'looks pale'. Christian was triaged using the Manchester Triage System as category 2. 9. A plan was made for ongoing observations, an ECG, bloods and IV fluids. Only the observations and ECG were ticked as having been done. 10. Christian was moved into the resuscitation area of the ED, together with his parents. He was in a wheelchair. 11. The first set of observations were documented at 18:00. These recorded a respiratory rate of 25, SpO2 97 on air, temperature 35.9C, blood pressure 79/46, Alert on the AVPU scale. 12. The NEWS score was 10. 13. It was documented that the observations should be continued at 30-minute intervals. 14. The first ECG was done at 18:07. 15. A nurse was involved in care in the resuscitation room together with an ST3 Doctor with the latter recording a number of entries in the notes from circa 18:10 onwards when the assessment was undertaken. 16. The presenting problem was documented as cough, raised temperature, palpitations. 17. The history included: · Unwell since yesterday morning · Felt palpitations while having lunch · In the night developed cough, productive of white phlegm · Had raised temperature and took paracetamol and ibuprofen · Body ache and three episodes of vomiting · Chest tightness but no pain · SOB at times 18. It was also documented that there was no nasal discharge or blockage, no sore throat, no rashes or neck pain, no abdominal pain, and no sudden change in bowel habit. 19. Those observations were recorded as per the observations done at 18:00. In addition, Christian was documented as being dehydrated ++. The pulse was documented as regular with normal heart sounds and the chest was clear with no increase in respiratory effort. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. Christian was not delirious, the GCS was 15, and neurological examination was normal. 20. The working diagnosis was noted as ? sepsis ?chest infection ?viral. 21. The management plan was: · ECG (this was done at 18:07 – described as sinus tachycardia). · Bloods – VBG, cultures · CXR · Urinalysis (a dipstick of the urine to look for signs of infection etc). · IV fluids · Antibiotics · TCI (meaning to come in) under medics if required. 22. The assessment was noted as completed at 18:35. 23. An x-ray was undertaken at circa 18:55 24. Normal saline 1L (an intravenous fluid) and co-amoxiclav 1.2g were prescribed at 18:30 and were documented as started/given at 19:00. 25. Further observations documented at 18:30 reported respiratory rate 23, SpO2 96% on air, temperature 35.6, BP 94/43, heart rate 143, alert. The NEWS score was 8.

Bloods were received at the haematology laboratory at 20:07 (taken at 19:50), and the clinical chemistry laboratory at 20:13. 33. Observations documented at 20:00 respiratory rate 30, SpO2 100% on air, temperature 36.2, BP 83/?56, heart rate 141, alert, blood sugar 5.6 and a NEWS of 9. Nursing documentation at 20:00 stated 'No change to pt [patient] condition'. 34. At around 20:15 it was documented that 'mother called for help – pt agitated-? Peri-arrest then started agonal breathing.' 35. Retrospective notes written at 20:30 by a medical registrar documented: · Patient suddenly started gasping and not responding at around 20:00 · ED team attended – no pulse · Pads attached; polymorphic VT noted. · CPR started, 150J shock given, CPR continued · ROSC , lasted for few ? min · Again lost pulse, CPR started · ROSC obtained · Magnesium infusion + amiodarone infusion started [MgSO4 2g (8 mmol) is documented as given at 20:20, amiodarone 300 mg is documented as given at 21:07] · Decision to intubate made by ED Consultant · Intubated under sedation 36. Retrospective notes written at 20:30 by an ST6 EM documented that they attended a peri arrest buzzer and that the patient was in cardiac arrest and that CPR was in progress. The ED/ICU Consultant was leading. The ST6 EM managed the airway and intubated the trachea uneventfully. 37. Haematology results were reported at 20:22 – the only abnormality being a raised white cell count of 16.4 (monocytes 1.1, neutrophils 13.1). 38. A second ECG was done at 21:09. On it was documented 'SR (sinus rhythm)'. 39. Clinical Chemistry results were reported at 21:08 and were phoned through to ED. A call from the lab was documented at 21:20: sodium 13, potassium. 6.5, creatinine 115 40. Other abnormalities on the clinical chemistry were, a raised lactate (4.7mmol/L), raised urea (10.5 mmol/L), raised CRP (44 mg/L) and a slightly raised ALT (64 U/L). Of note the troponin T was raised at 118 ng/L. 41. An ABG taken at 21:15 showed a severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (pH 6.97, PaCO2 8.52, BE -17.6, lactate 8.7) and a raised potassium (5.23). The PaO2 was 27 on 80% oxygen. 42. Christian had a urinary catheter inserted. 43. A second chest X-ray was done at ~ 20:48. 44. An ABG taken at 21:51 showed an ongoing severe lactic acidosis (pH 7.1, BE-4.2, lactate 10.3). The PaO2 was 14.56 on 21% oxygen. 45. A third ECG was done at 22:06 46. An ABG taken at 22:21 showed lactic acidosis (pH 7.05, – 16.3, lactate 11.2). The PaO2 was 12.43 on 21% oxygen. 47. Retrospective notes by the ED consultant at 23:35 documented: · Responded to cry for help – parents in resus · Patient had suddenly become unresponsive and started gasping · Agonal respiratory effort · HR 192 regular on monitor – palpable pulse · Oxygen applied followed by resp arrest · BVM and pads · VF on monitor and no pulse · Shock x 1 followed by CPR · ROSC – tachy then VT with pulse followed by PEA arrest [pulseless electrical activity] · CPR for less than one minute before signs of life. Patient moving arms · HR 154 SVT SBP 111 GCS 4 (E1V1M2) . Minimal respiratory effort. · I+V · Hypotensive despite IV fluids (2L) and metaraminol boluses (a vasoconstrictor drug that is used to raise the blood pressure – a total of 9.5 mg was given between 20:25 and 21:05). · Amiodarone and MgSO4 infusions (anti-arrhythmic drugs) (MgSO4 2g (8 mmol) is documented as given at 20:20, amiodarone 300 mg is documented as given at 21:07) · Ceftriaxone given (? Meningoccal sepsis) 2g documented as given at 21:40] · L femoral CVC placed. · Noradrenaline infusion commenced. R femoral arterial line placed · ICU consultant present. 48. Bedside echo by an ICU consultant and also another clinician showed septal wall akinesia. IVC filled. 49. BP remained 80 systolic despite increased noradrenaline (1 g/kg/min). Hydrocortisone 100 mg documented as given at 21:00. Dobutamine 30 mL/hr commenced as started at 21:45. 50. In addition, it was documented that terlipressin 0.5mg was given at 21:55 and that actrapid 10u/50 mL 50% glucose was given but no time was provided. 51. A further litre of normal saline was documented as being given at 21:10. 52. Worsening ABGs: 100 mL 8.4% NaHCO3 , 10 ml 10% calcium gluconate is timed as given at 21:25 53. ECG ? Brugada 54. A tertiary hospital Cardiology SpR was informed about possible salvage ECMO 55. The systolic BP dropped to 60 mmHg and boluses of adrenaline (total of 400g given between 22:09 and 22:18) were given without response. An adrenaline infusion was started at 22:18 56. A calcium chloride infusion was started at 22:35 57. Observations at 22:25 recorded BP 50/31 and HR 108 58. The blood pressure remained low (systolic blood pressure < 50 and the lactate continued to increase (11.2 on ABG done at 22:21). 59. Observations at 22:45 recorded BP 68/40 and HR 135. 60. Christian was increasingly mottled, worsening gas exchange – likely due to poor perfusion. 61. He was mainly unsedated throughout and no further muscle relaxants since RSI. 62. A call was made to a transplant fellow at a tertiary hospital – the response was, 'unsure if can help, will speak to consultant' 63. There was a discussion with the tertiary hospital ICU consultant who said, 'No one is entirely sure what the aetiology is. It is therefore very difficult to know what can be reversed by ECMO, and it is unlikely to be tolerated. Given the prolonged period of hypotension and lack of reversible cause which we can further improve, there is nothing more that can be done'. 64. This was discussed with the family, and it was agreed to stop active treatment and allow him to die which was documented at 23:45. 65. An independent expert report opined that when Christian was first assessed in ED, the symptoms were non-specific (palpitations, chest tightness, cough, aching, vomiting) but there were several concerning observations indicating severe illness. These included: · Tachycardia (fast heart rate) with the lowest rate being 132 and rates of up to 240 documented (a rate that is non-physiological and indicative of an arrhythmia – abnormal heart rhythm).· · Hypotension (low blood pressure) · Tachypnoea (fast respiratory rate) · Hypothermia (low temperature) · High NEWS score (8-10) · Looking pale [documented by triage nurse and resus practitioner] · Dehydrated ++ was documented at the first medical review. 66. The expert felt that it was appropriate that Christian was moved into the resuscitation area of the ED where he could be continuously monitored and where there is a high staff/patient ratio. 67. The NEWS score of 10 required the triggering of a clinical response (as documented in the Emergency Department Majors proforma): · The medical review at 18:10 was reasonably comprehensive but missed several key points including: · There was no reference to the heart rate of 240 that was documented in the Doctors notes. It is likely that these arrhythmias were ventricular tachycardia. · It was not documented whether Christian had been passing urine normally. · The capillary refill time and the strength of the peripheral pulses were not documented, a short capillary refill time and bounding pulse may have more in keeping with sepsis, and a slow capillary refill time and weak pulse would have been more in keeping with a low cardiac output state from either hypovolaemia (reduced blood volume) or reduced cardiac contractility. · The jugular venous pressure (JVP) was not documented (a sign of central venous filling pressures and cardiac function). · The ECG was documented as sinus tachycardia. I accepted the evidence of a number of experts that this was not a normal ECG and that there were other non-specific abnormalities. · It was considered that the non-specific abnormalities could be seen in conditions such as hyperkalaemia [high potassium levels] and cardiac dilatation. · A chest X-ray was requested but the results of this were not documented. · In the opinion of the expert ICU consultant, the CXR showed some soft ground glass opacification (GGO), mild upper lobe diversion (increased blood flow to the upper parts of the lung because of increased left sided heart pressures), and some fluid in the horizontal fissure (fluid outside of the lung sitting between the upper and middle lobes) – all these are consistent with heart failure, but they are not specific. In his opinion, these were quite subtle signs and could easily be missed. A retrospective review by a specialist forensic radiologist was clear on the presence of cardiomegaly on the imaging. · Chest sepsis can cause GGO but in the opinion of the ICU expert there was no clear evidence of chest sepsis on the CXR. · The ICU expert did see evidence of some mild pleural fluid in the horizontal fissure. 68. The medical diagnosis was of possible sepsis. I found that it was appropriate to have this high on the list of differential diagnoses as although the presentation was not classic, sepsis can present in many ways and a high index of suspicion is required. 69. However, I did find that it should have been immediately recognised that Christian was in a shocked state from his tachycardia, hypotension, and poor perfusion. 70. When a patient presents with undifferentiated shock (unclear cause), I concurred with the expert evidence, that it is important to immediately initiate therapy whilst rapidly trying to identify the aetiology so that definitive therapy can be administered. 71. I again agreed that it should be expected that any clinician would rapidly treat and investigate the cause of the shock and to regularly reassess to determine the response to treatment and to review the results of investigations. This would need discussion with Senior staff. There was a discussion between the ST3 and the ED consultant but the information exchange did not lead to a consultant face to face assessment of Christian prior to his arrest. 72. The differential diagnosis was not broadened prior to the cardiac arrest. 73. I agreed that it could be expected that a clinician should have recognised that Christian was acutely unwell. 74. As part of the rapid assessment of the aetiology of the shock I concurred with the view that a low cardiac output state ought to have been considered. Because of the probable tachyarrhythmias, the abnormal ECG, the tachycardia and the low blood pressure, cardiac pathology should have been considered. Several entries in the records pointed to Christian being in a 'shut down' state (poor peripheral perfusion) – this was documented by the triage nurse ('looks pale'), the ST3 ED doctor ('dehydrated ++) and the resuscitation room practitioner ('pallor', 'struggling to get venous bloods'). This should have further increased the suspicion of a low cardiac output state. 75. Focused echocardiography was not undertaken and would be a key diagnostic tool, when it is available. It could have answered several simple questions such as: · Is the heart dilated? · Is the heart contracting normally? · Is the heart/circulation well filled? · Is there a pericardial effusion (fluid in the sac around the heart) and if so, is this compromising the heart? 76. An ICU expert was of the opinion that focused echocardiogram should have been done and would likely have shown some abnormalities. An expert Cardiologist also emphasized the importance of this diagnostic tool. 77. It was stated that in sepsis, especially after appropriate fluid challenges, the heart is usually well filled and pumping vigorously on echocardiogram. In cardiogenic shock, the heart function is impaired on echocardiogram and depending on the cause, the chambers may be dilated. 78. The ICU expert indicated that a possible diagnosis of sepsis should have triggered a bundle of assessments/interventions such as the Sepsis 6 bundle. The Sepsis 6 Bundle/Pathway is a series of simple interventions that has been widely used in the NHS since 2007 – it aims to reduce the mortality from sepsis. 79. By the time Christian was in the resuscitation room, he had three 'Red Flag' triggers on the Sepsis Screening tool, any one of which should have triggered the Sepsis 6 pathway. The Sepsis 6 pathway includes the interventions, all of which should be completed within one hour: · Administer oxygen · Take blood cultures, think source control [where is the infection arising from and can the source be controlled]. Chest X-ray and urinalysis. · Give IV antibiotics · Give IV fluids – if hypotensive or lactate >2 then 500 mL stat, which may be repeated if clinically indicated · Check serial lactates – if lactate > 4 and recheck after fluid challenges mmol/L then call critical care · Measure urine output and commence fluid balance chart · If the above interventions do not work or the patient is clearly critically ill, then immediate referral to critical care is indicated. 80. The chest X-ray showed some abnormalities consistent with heart failure; however, there was no handwritten documentation of the time that it was reviewed or what it showed. 81. Intravenous fluids were commenced but these were not given as rapid boluses and targeted against response – Christian remained hypotensive and tachycardic despite the fluid administration. 82. Apart from the blood cultures, bloods were not taken until 19:44. 83. I found that that the urgency of the situation was under-appreciated by the treating team. An expert indicated that it is very well recognised that unwell, and normally fit, children/young adults often look quite well until the point at which they rapidly decompensate. In the experts opinion, the fact that Christian was sitting up and talking resulted in a false sense of security and an under-appreciation of the physiological abnormalities on the part of some of those involved. 84. The expert also opined that there was a clear delay in getting the first blood gas. A cannula was in situ by circa 19:00, when intravenous fluids and antibiotics were given, and a venous blood gas should have been taken from this. This would likely have shown a raised lactate and potassium (as the ABG did at 19:44) – both of which would have impacted on management and should have further highlighted the severity of the situation. 85. I found that if there was difficulty in getting bloods, then this needed to be resolved by deployment of appropriate measures to expedite this. 86. Earlier correction of the high potassium, if it had been measured and recognised, may possibly have reduced the chance of further arrythmias. 87. Cyclizine was given as an antiemetic at circa 19:20. SUBSEQUENT CARE DURING AND AFTER THE CARDIAC ARREST 88. I share the views expressed in written reports and oral evidence that the care given during the resuscitation was generally of a high standard and everything possible was done to restore a spontaneous circulation and to protect organs from damage. 89. Once return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) had been achieved then it was appropriate to intubate and commence mechanical ventilation. 90. The viewing and findings of the chest X-ray done at 20:48 were not documented. 91. I was of the view that the clinical situation after ROSC was extremely challenging with ongoing shock and hypotension despite multiple interventions. There was significant post cardiac arrest 'cardiac stunning' in the context of an already dilated and weak heart from the pre-existing cardiomyopathy. 92. The evidence of fluid management after arrest was hampered by a lack of clarity over timings and the nature of retrospective entries.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN ARE: POINT A - RE: CARDIOGENIC SHOCK CS) TO: i. Department of Health and Social Care Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 ii. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB iii. NWAFT I have a concern over funding availability and implementation of the key recommendations set out below. The Intensive Care Society and British Cardiovascular Society issued a comprehensive report in October 2022 with the title - Shock to Survival: a framework to improve the care and outcomes of people with cardiogenic shock in the UK. The Executive Summary reported that patients with cardiogenic shock need defined pathways of escalation and care to improve survival. It was stated that CS is a commonly encountered but often under recognised clinical challenge with high mortality. This document outlined several recommendations as part of a systems approach to improving patient survival and experience. These included but were not limited to: A. Increase awareness among healthcare staff that any deteriorating patient with an elevated National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 and evidence of hypoperfusion should prompt consideration of CS as a potential cause. Echocardiography or focused cardiac ultrasound FoCUS and electrocardiogram should follow urgently. B. Improve access to echocardiography out of hours (including FoCUS with expert review) to support/exclude the diagnosis of CS or other cardiac pathologies C. Adopt SCAI staging as the standardised descriptor of CS to facilitate triage, communication and expediency of discussion with a CS centre. D. Establish CS centres as part of regional CS networks to bring together the most critically ill patients with the right clinical expertise E. Ensure equity of access to CS expertise and care, including short-term MCS, through the design of CS networks and distribution of CS centres F. Develop clear pathways of care and protocols for CSS care within networks to complement existing acute cardiac care pathways, including 24/7 access to CS MDT's and transfer to CS centres G. Developed network protocols for patient selection for short- term MCS H. Define a minimum CS data set and collect this data, including through existing national audits, encompassing the entire patient pathway Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 I. Prioritise high-quality research in CS to address important areas of uncertainty, including a patient selection for short-term MCS and cost- effectiveness of improved care pathways. The report recognised that the National Cardiac Pathway Improvement Programme (CPIP) represented an opportunity to embed many of these recommendations, to potentially transform outcomes in CS patients, and CPIP leaders nationally and regionally should work with stakeholders and CS experts to implement them. POINT B - RE: ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY TO: i. Department of Health and Social Care ii. Royal College of Emergency Medicine iii. The Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine iv. NWAFT v. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB Christian had not had an echocardiogram prior to his arrest. This was a concerning feature of his care in the ED given he was critically unwell and in a shocked state. Whilst the paper below focussed on critical care, there is a concern on the use of echocardiography in EDs and also within critical care departments given the findings that emerged from this research. The paper by Luke Flower (et al) : The use of echocardiography in the management of shock in critical care: a prospective, multi-centre, observational study ( Intensive Care Medicine :2024) emphasised that echocardiography was reported to either reduce diagnostic uncertainty or change management in 291 ( 54%) cases, with a change in management in 270 (50%) and a reduction in of diagnostic uncertainty in in 120 ( 20%) of patients. The conclusion was that urgent echocardiography is not routinely used in the assessment of critically ill patients with shock in the UK and Crown Dependencies, despite international guidance. The study suggests that echocardiography may alter management and improve diagnostic certainty in patients with undifferentiated shock. Future work should explore barriers to the expansion of echocardiography provision within critical care to permit improved equity of care amongst patients presenting with shock. The study was on behalf of NEAT ECHO collaborators and in association with the British Society of Echocardiography (BSE). The BSE highlighted an additional study finding that it was disappointing to read that only 25% of echocardiograms adhered to national storage guidance. This discrepancy was said in part to relate to poor underlying infrastructure for electronic image storage and transfer. The BSE commented that this was a reminder that delivering a high-quality echo service is not Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 only reliant on having an echo machine, but also a variety of additional background information technology components that the BSE would recommend as inconceivable to be absent from a modern CT or MRI imaging service. POINT C - FLUID MANAGEMENT To: i. NWAFT ii. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB (CPICB) Intravenous fluids were commenced but these were not targeted against response. Christian remained hypotensive and tachycardic despite the fluid administration. This is an area of concern also. Another example of this is seen in a coronial investigation into the death of LM within the trust under reference 01976-2023. An independent expert flagged an issue on fluid management in that matter and the Trust SI report also found that the effects of Hartman's solution was not evaluated, and no further fluids were given. Additionally, adherence to policy on completion of fluid balance charts and the understanding and need for acting on flags is a matter of concern. It is not clear if the trust and CPICB has identified this as a recurring theme in audits/deep dive reviews. POINT D -TEAM INTERACTIONS To: i. NWAFT A concern arises over communications within a team itself and also interactions with other teams – e.g. when a referral is made to the medical team. The under appreciation by some staff of how critically unwell Christian was raises an issue on exchanges of information and team culture. An example is the entry … 'TCI medics, if required' … and so there was no expression of the need for urgent review by the medical team by the key clinician involved in ED care. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The cases of CR under case ref :03638-2019 and SO under case ref: 00133-2023 are further examples on issues of team interactions. A final example is seen again in the death of LM (see ref earlier). The SI of the trust found that case management and plans should be carried out in a timely manner, (particularly administration of antibiotics, blood test requests and specialty team assessment following referral from the ED). It was found that the deceased had not been seen by the medical team after referral to them and before a cardiac arrest. POINT E – RADIOLOGY WITHIN NWAFT TO: i. NWAFT Another recurring theme is radiology within the trust. In the case of Christian, nothing is recorded in the notes on assessment of the X-Rays undertaken. There have also been a number of instances in our coroner investigations where there is an issue surrounding radiology. POINT F -RADIOLOGY NATIONALLY TO: i. The Royal College of Radiology ii. Department of Health and Social Care I have a concern over whether there are sufficient numbers of radiologists to cover the ever-increasing expansion of imaging as a key diagnostic tool. Further, there seems an almost two-tier system – that available in Tertiary hospitals and that available in district general hospitals. POINT G – BLOOD GASES/ ELEVATED LACTATE TO: i. NWAFT There was a delay in getting the first blood gas. A cannula was in situ by circa 19:00, when intravenous fluids and antibiotics were given. A venous blood gas should have been taken from this. This would likely have shown a raised lactate and potassium (as Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 the ABG did at 19:44) – both of which would have impacted on management and would have further highlighted the severity of the situation. The ABG at 19:44 was consistent with a compensated lactic acidosis and hyperkalaemia. In the case of CR (see earlier ref). A blood gas requested by an anaesthetist was not done. A further example is seen in the coronial investigation into the death of SO (see earlier ref) where an expert concluded that lactate was not measured until 02:30 on 30.12.2022 and it was 5.1. mmol/L – recognition of its elevation would likely have prompted earlier senior review, CT imaging and review by critical care. Again, in the death of LM (see earlier ref). An independent expert report has raised a number of issues on clinical management in that matter. Specifically, the lactate was 9.18 from a VBG timed at 05:10 on 28/7/23 and the trust itself in an SI report concluded that there was no escalation. The death of Christian and these further examples raise a concern. POINT H - CRITICAL CARE TO: i. NWAFT ii. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB (CPICB) The CQC reports in 2018 and 2019 highlighted issues surrounding critical care. The coronial investigation into the death at Hinchingbrooke Hospital of CR (see earlier ref) led to an independent expert's report being commissioned that flagged suboptimal care. There was a finding of neglect (a gross failure of basic medical care) at the final inquest hearing. There would not appear to have been a Trust SI report in that matter. There are concerns about resources and training within the trust for this specialty. Furthermore, there is a concern as to whether the trust has had/acted upon any internal/ external review of the CCU at Hinchingbrooke Hospital. POINT I - DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS TO: i. NWAFT A recurring theme is lack of a differential diagnosis which raises concerns about Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 training. POINT J - SEPSIS PATHWAY TO: i. NWAFT ii. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB C&P ICB This is again another theme and accordingly raises a concern about training and auditing. Within the context of the death of LM (see earlier case ref), there was inter alia, a delay in the administration of antibiotics and cultures were not taken. Again, the case of CR (see earlier case ref) highlighted deficiencies on this topic. POINT K- ANTIEMETIC MEDICATION To: i. NWAFT ii. Royal College of Emergency Medicine iii. Department of Health and Social Care It will be seen from the circumstances set out earlier that cyclizine was administered at 19:20. Christian arrested at shortly after 20:00. This drug is known to cause adverse cardiovascular effects – tachycardia, arrythmias, hypertension and hypotension. Therefore, it is at least possible, given the subsequent physiological collapse of Christian that this medication possibly had some adverse effect on a background of an underlying arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. I have a concern on clinical knowledge of such effects of this drug and pharmacologic consequences of other drugs also. This was highlighted in the paper: Ventricular Fibrillation Arrest Triggered by Antemetics Revealing an Underlying Long QT Syndrome in a Young Woman. Cureus 16(7). July 2024. It was emphasised that with antiemetic prescriptions being a common practice, it is vital to educate about their side effects, such as prolongation on QT. Exercising future caution before using these medications will help mitigate the risk of such adverse events. While emergency departments are already so busy, routine ECGs could help Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 prevent such disasters from happening. It is also essential to ensure that doctors are equipped with the necessary skills and experience for early recognition of such a phenomenon. A multilayered approach focusing on clinical education from undergraduate to postgraduate levels alongside multidisciplinary collaboration can help ensure the delivery of high-quality care going forward. POINT L – ECG ANALYSIS TO: i. NWAFT ii. Department of Health and Social Care iii. Royal College of Emergency Medicine Some Issues emerged in evidence on the interpretation of the ECG at 18:10. It has been pointed out in a study by Abdalla and Khanra: Electrocardiography interpretation proficiency among medical doctors of different grades in the UK. Cureus 2022 that analysing the ECG interpretation proficiency among medical doctors showed low levels of clinician confidence in interpreting ECGs. The paper in point K above also stated that this highlighted a deficiency that needs urgent attention due to the importance of the investigation, especially since an abnormal ECG can lead to potentially life-threatening consequences. Continued education was said to be paramount to ensure safe management of patients with LQTS. This again raises concerns. POINT M -RECORD KEEPING TO: i. NWAFT There was a lack of recorded evidence on key aspects of Christians care. This was flagged also in CQC inspections and within the context of this investigation there was no record of measurement of jugular venous pressure or capillary refill time and no record of reviews of X-Rays. Again, in the case of LM (see case ref earlier), the trust SI report found nothing in the notes about staff action with the patient at a critical timepoint. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Reference to this also arose in the case of CR (see case ref earlier) where the expert flagged inadequate documentation. POINT N - DATA FROM EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ALARMS TO: i. NWAFT Family evidence was heard that there appeared to be deactivation of the monitor alarm at a particular point in time and when Christian arrested, they had to call staff members for help. The monitor evidence was not available for analysis of heart rhythms etc because there was no retention of the data at the time. This hampered consideration of data in the death that required detailed review and this is a concern. This was a case where a retention of the data, given the circumstances, would have greatly assisted understanding physiological changes at key points and would assist lessons to be learned to mitigate risk of other deaths. POINT O – LEARNING FROM HSSIB REPORTS TO: i. NWAFT I have a concern on whether the HSSIB report – RECOGNISING AND RESPONDING TO CRITICALLY UNWELL PATIENTS is firmly embedded in staff training. POINT P - PATIENT SAFETY IN SOME TRUST AREAS TO: i. NWAFT ii. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB The CQC reports in 2018 and 2019 indicated there was a requirement for improvement when inspecting whether services were safe. There have now been a number of independent expert reviews in coronial investigations which have highlighted sub optimal clinical care in fact specific Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 scenarios. NWAFT cases and issues arising, seem to exceed the number of cases referred from tertiary hospitals in this coronial area. This is a concern and it is unclear as to whether there has been a deep dive audit/review to look at patterns/trends rather than simply looking at raw overall mortality data POINT Q – TESTING IN COMPETITIVE SPORTS FOR CARDIAC CONDITIONS TO: i. Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The paper by Teresina Vesella (et al) in Br J Sports Med 2019 :The Italian evaluation programme : diagnostic yield, rate of disqualification and cost analysis pointed out that Italian Law mandated that every athlete must undergo annual preparticipation evaluation ( PPE) to identify cardiovascular diseases that pose a risk of sudden death during sport and other conditions that may threaten the athlete's health. The conclusion was that PPE according to the Italian model identified a range of diseases in 2.0 % of apparently healthy athletes at an average cost of 79 euros per athlete. The paper by H.MacLachlan (et al) in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport in 2022 concluded that an electrocardiogram-based national screening programme identified a major cardiac condition in 0.3 % of the cohort (in elite cricketers). I have a concern about funding mechanisms being available to say England Boxing that would enable appropriate screening for competitive boxers where there is already a mandatory need for a medical examination under the 'fit or not fit to box' protocol. This would aid further research on this important topic. Additionally, there may be a lack of general awareness for parents of sports participants on the issue of sudden cardiac death and so there may be a gap in knowledge/understanding of possible emergence of red flag symptoms. This is despite the outstanding work of CRY. POINT R – CHILD DEATH OVERVIEW PANEL REVIEW TO: i. NORTHAMPTONSHIRE SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN PARTNERSHIP Whilst the death occurred in Cambridgeshire, it is understood that the Northamptonshire CDOP reviewed this matter. However, it appears that a copy of the Analysis Proforma is not available but taking information from a collation of reviews, there was no identification of any learning in terms of factors intrinsic to the social environment, physical environment or service provision. This is a concern given the Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 scale of the coronial investigation that has revealed a number of significant issues on clinical management. POINT S – NWAFT PAEDIATRIC MORTALITY REVIEW TO: i. NWAFT It is unclear whether any NWAFT paediatric review (it is noted that Christian was treated as an adult patient and the paediatric team were not involved in his acute care) found any issues from a learning perspective given the matters analysed at length within the coronial investigation. 6",17,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 07 April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: On the 20th May 2024 Sandra Millard was found deceased by her neighbour at her home address in Southcote Lane. She had called 111 for assistance on the 19th May 2024 reporting that she was unable to get out of her chair. As a clinician had not been able to contact her to investigate the reason no ambulance attended until after a neighbour attended the following day.,"On the 19 th May 2024 Sandra called 111 and advised she was unable to move from her chair. The call taker ended the call arranging for a clinician to call Sandra back for a detailed assessment to be carried out. The clinician attempted to call 4 times but Sandra's phone gave an engaged tone on each occasion. The clinician then closed the call without discussing this with their manager. No ambulance was dispatched. On the 20 th May 2024 Sandra's neighbour attended the house and found her deceased. At post mortem the cause of death was given as: 1a) Sepsis 1b) Infected leg ulcers 2) Ischaemic heart disease, Coronary artery atheroma & chronic kidney disease.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) I heard that when SCAS call takers using the NHS Pathways triage tool exit a module Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 indicating a person is lying on the floor with no reported injuries they are prompted to ask additional questions of the caller; including whether someone else is with the caller; whether the caller can provide a number for next of kin or other person who may be able to attend the caller whilst they wait for an ambulance. This is due to the likely delay of a number of hours before an ambulance can attend. This same procedure is not applied when someone reports that they are stuck in situ, for example they are unable to move from their chair. My concern is that the additional risks of a long lie, for example rhabdomyolosis, may well apply when someone in unable to move from any position. SCAS agreed to change their standard operating procedures to incorporate additional enquiries in these circumstances. I am pleased that they have agreed to amend their procedures swiftly. However this matter has wider significance and should be considered by other users of the NHS Pathways triage tool. 6",81,N/A: Not found

South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust 1,"On 21 March 2023, an inquest was opened, and an investigation commenced, into the death of Christopher McDonald, who was aged 41 at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, which was heard over 7-days between 17 and 25 March 2025, with a jury. The inquest engaged the enhanced investigative obligation under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The medical cause of death was: 1a Ligature strangulation; and 2 Schizoaffective disorder. The conclusion of the jury as to the death was that Mr McDonald died by strangulation by a ligature that he applied around his neck, but the evidence did not enable them to say what his intentions were. The following matters were recorded in the narrative conclusion: (1) There were shortcomings in the decision-making in relation to the suspension of Mr McDonald's section 17 leave on 24 February 2023, which possibly contributed to his death. The shortcomings were a lack of an individualised assessment and a failure to follow the “AWOL – Missing and Absent Persons Policy”. Had a member of the National Psychosis Unit (“NPU”) accompanied Mr McDonald back to the ward on 25 February 2025, it is possible that this may have mitigated any potential distress. (2) There was avoidable delay in the identification of the ligature by NPU staff. Had the NPU staff communicated Mr McDonald's medical history to London Ambulance Service staff, it is possible the ligature would have been discovered and removed in the first instance, possibly increasing his chances of successful resuscitation.","Christopher McDonald was pronounced dead at 14:28 on 26 February 2023 at Bethlem Royal Hospital, National Psychosis Unit. Mr McDonald had a history of mental ill-health and had been formally detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 since 14 November 2020. Mr McDonald was admitted to the Fitzmary 2 Ward of the NPU at Bethlem Royal Hospital on 7 July 2022. His diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. After Mr McDonald went AWOL on 24 February 2023, there is no evidence of an assessment of whether it was appropriate to permit Mr McDonald to remain at his mother's address until Sunday 26 February 2023. In reference to section 10 of the Awol – Missing and Absent Persons Policy, v. 10, there is no evidence of an action plan being drawn up by SLAM staff and the police. No member of NPU staff accompanied the police to escort Mr McDonald back to the ward. When Mr McDonald returned to the ward on 25 February 2023, his level of observation should have remained intermittent, but there is no evidence of it being reviewed. There is no evidence of any observations between 12:15 and 9pm on 25 February. Mr McDonald was reviewed by the duty doctor at 16:50. There is no evidence of any discussion of observation levels. Section 17 leave was suspended pending review by the ward consultant. At 13:30 on 26 February 2023, Mr McDonald was found unresponsive. The NPU staff started an emergency response but did not find the ligature around Mr McDonald's neck. The LAS staff were not informed of Mr McDonald's history of suicidal ideation involving ligature. A senior LAS paramedic identified and removed the ligature between 1:50 and 1:55pm. Artificial ventilation was not applied by the ward staff because of the use of a non-rebreathe oxygen mask rather than a bag-valve mask. Due to the continued presence of the ligature it was not possible to administer successful CPR.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that staff working on the NPU did not have knowledge or a clear understanding of the “AWOL - Missing & Absent Persons Policy” of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (“SLAM”) Specifically: (1) Whilst there should be an individualised assessment of whether it is appropriate to suspend section 17 when a patient goes AWOL: (a) one member of staff at the inquest gave evidence that it was “standard practice” and “protocol” that leave would be suspended; and (b) there was no evidence of any individualised assessment in Mr McDonald's case. (2) The policy provides that SLAM staff should always accompany the police if the patient is to be returned from their home. This was not done in this case, and there was no evidence that any member of NPU staff considered this once Mr McDonald was located at his mother's address on 24 February 2023. (3) The policy provides that if the police are likely to be involved in returning the patient to hospital then an action plan – jointly drafted between the police and Trust staff - needs to be drawn up. This was not done in this case, and there was no evidence that this was considered or completed by SLAM staff. 6",41,N/A: Not found

The conclusion as to June's death was as follows. June died from recognized complications of necessary medical treatment.","1) June died after a short illness following diagnosis of a very aggressive form of cancer in the hip which spread to the lungs. 2) June first presented with symptoms associated with her cause of death in January 2023 and was initially treated at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro (RCHT) where a cancerous hip tumour was identified. 3) The rapid growth of the tumour meant that her case had to be transferred to Oxford University Hospital (OUH) for specialist surgery which was not available at RCHT. June required a hindquarter amputation, involving the removal of the whole leg and hip joint, the latter to include removal of the tumour from the hip. 4) This major surgery was originally proposed to June as being a curative operation. On this basis June consented to the operation, and the procedure was approved by the surgical Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT). 5) Meanwhile RCHT continued to assist with scans and other treatments. A CT scan report conducted 26 July 2025 by RCHT indicated that the cancer had spread. The scan report showed multiple new lung metastases. The cancer in the lungs was of such an extent that it was not operable or treatable. 6) June's clinical condition had now changed from being curative to palliative. 7) The 26 July RCHT CT scan report was sent to OUH and uploaded to the OUH digital file on 15 August 2025. The scan report was not directly emailed to the OUH surgeon. 8) The operation went ahead on the 23 August 2023. June's leg was amputated and the tumour in the hip removed. 9) The surgeon stated that at the time of the operation he was not aware that June's clinical condition had changed from curative to palliative. The surgeon stated that his attention was drawn to the CT scan report after the operation. 10) The surgeon had operated on the false basis that this was a curative operation. 11) The patient June had consented to the operation on the false basis that this was a curative operation. 12) The MDT had supported the decision to operate without being informed of the change in clinical condition. 13) June suffered a number of complications after the amputation and required two further operations to deal with these issues. June was not discharged from hospital until 20 October 2023 when she returned home to die with her family on 1 November 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 01 April 2025. The Narrative Conclusion of the Inquest was: The Deceased suffered from acute on chronic kidney impairment and kidney infection but died from paracetamol induced liver failure whilst being treated in hospital,"At around lunchtime on 29 August 2023, the Deceased was admitted by ambulance to Bedford Hospital, having been found on her bedroom floor. She had reported to her carer that she had been there since falling in her dining room and crawling to her bedroom two days previously. She was described by the attending paramedics as being very weak, very slim and frail. In the Accident and Emergency Department, it was noted she was cachectic and dehydrated but her liver function tests were normal. She was admitted to a ward later that evening. Her weight was not taken prior to nursing staff asking a night junior doctor (who had not seen her nor had access to her records) at around 23.37 hours, to prescribe her with paracetamol. As the doctor was unaware that she weighed less than 50 kg, she was prescribed 1,000 mg of paracetamol to be taken 4 times daily. Although nursing staff estimated her weight at 44 kg the following day, and her actual weight was confirmed to be 33.6kg sometime on 31 August 2023, she continued to receive the prescribed dose of paracetamol until the evening of 31 August 2023, when the last dose was withheld by nursing staff. The reason for the withholding of the last dose of paracetamol on 31 August 2023 remained unclear. At around 11.20 hours on 1 September 2023, she suffered an episode of coffee ground vomiting. She continued to receive a further dose of paracetamol at 11.48 hours on 1 September 2023 but at the lower level of 500 mg. The reason for the reduced dose was also not clear. Following receipt of blood test results at 13:28 hours on 1 September 2023, which showed a significant derangement in her liver function, the administration of paracetamol ceased, and she was treated for paracetamol induced liver injury. Despite treatment, her condition deteriorated and as she was not a candidate for a liver transplant or intensive care treatment, she was placed on end-of-life care. She passed away at the hospital on 3 September 2023; her death being confirmed at 22.12 hours. Post-mortem examination confirmed that, whilst her fall and initial admission were due to acute on chronic kidney impairment and kidney infection, her immediate cause of death was liver failure.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. Despite the fact that the HSSIB made Safety Observations to mitigate the risks of unintentional paracetamol overdose in adult inpatients with low bodyweight in their National Report dated 24.02.2022 (https://www.hssib.org.uk/patient-safety- investigations/unintentional-overdse-of-paracetamol-in-adults-with-low- bodyweight/) none of these had been addressed/adopted at Bedford Hospital by the time of the Deceased's admission on 29 August 2023 which meant that, despite weighing only 33.6kg, the Deceased was prescribed a daily dose of 1,000 mg x 4 which was only suitable for a patient weighing in excess of 50kg. 2. A lengthy PSII investigation (completed on 16 September 2024 and received by the Senior Coroner on 24 October 2024) delayed the hearing of the Inquest but also left unanswered questions. In particular, there was no explanation as to why the nursing staff, having estimated the Deceased's weight at 44 kg the day after the paracetamol was prescribed (which although quite incorrect was still below the threshold for a prescription of that level) still proceeded to administer the prescribed dose yet did not administer the last dose on the night of 31 August 2023 and administered only ½ the prescribed dose the following morning. Further exploration of this with the relevant staff might well highlight additional safety concerns (for example, did nursing staff feel unable to challenge the prescription directly with the doctors?). 3. Despite the PSII report referencing the 2022 HSSIB report and recommending that this should be shared with staff, relevant Safety Observations made in the HSSIB Report appear to have been insufficiently addressed: (a) Although Bedford Hospitals NHS Trust are now using the Nervecentre electronic record system which, since 28th February 2024, has included the height and weight of patients and prevents a prescribing doctor from prescribing without a patient's weight having first been entered, staff are still able to enter a estimated weight and there do not appear to be any alerts on this system to advise of the need for weight accuracy in the prescription of oral paracetamol and consideration of the risk of liver toxicity in those weighing under 50 kg (as advised in Safety Observation 02/2022/151); (b) Whilst the PSII report states as an Action that “Patients should be weighed on admission and the information documented”, other than the provision of a 'pat slide', no other practical actions are planned for actually achieving this outcome, particularly in respect of those adults at risk of an unintentional paracetamol overdose, such as an alert aimed at those administering medication as well as those prescribing it (as advised in Safety Observation 02/2022/151). 6",72,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held with a jury on 3 April 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was natural causes, and the medical cause of death was 1a Sepsis, Pneumonia (Group a Streptococcus)","Hailey Anne Thompson attended her GP on 7th December 2022 and was prescribed antibiotics to treat bacterial tonsillitis. They were subsequently stopped after 3 days due to Hailey developing a rash, thought to be an allergic reaction. There was a missed opportunity for this to be reviewed at primary care level, however this did not contribute to her death. Hailey remained unwell and was seen by her GP on 16th December 2022, and again on 18th December 2022 at the A&E department at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan. On both occasions a viral upper respiratory infection was diagnosed and therefore, antibiotics were not required. On the morning of 19th December 2022, Hailey was found unresponsive at home. She was transported to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan by ambulance. Efforts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful and she was declared deceased. The cause of death was sepsis, arising from Streptococcus A infection in the lungs causing Pneumonia.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the course of evidence, an issue was explored regarding Hailey's mother attempting to obtain an appointment or advice with the GP surgery following an apparent allergic reaction to prescribed antibiotics. These had been prescribed on 7 December for tonsilitis but stopped after three days due to an apparent allergic reaction. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 2. During a call to the GP surgery, Hailey's mother spoke with an administrative member of staff (who at the inquest was referred to as a care navigator at a call centre). The staff member referred an appointment to a pharmacist working with the practice to call her. 3. The pharmacist to whom this was assigned was not competent to deal with a paediatric medication enquiry and sent a message back advising of this, albeit not on the medical records system where an auditable trail would exist. On the evidence, the pharmacist was not provided with feedback directly on the need to use the medical records system or involved in the lessons learned process as they were not directly employed by the practice. 4. A further concern arose during the course of evidence from the primary care practice manager that a care navigator may not have a clear pathway on whom to refer a task or action to, or triage tool to recognise that a reported allergic reaction to a medication may require urgent consideration by a doctor to assess any risk of anaphylactic shock. 5. No evidence was provided to: a. explain how a patient telephoning the practice and being answered by the call centre would be referred to the urgent triage doctor on duty at the practice, b. whether a list of clinician competencies and whom to refer tasks to was held c. Care Navigator training d. Algorithms or policies that apply to assist care navigator / call handlers at a centre which is not located within the doctor surgery. 6. These issues are important as I had no reassurance that an administrative member of staff who spoke with a patient contacting the practice, had a clear pathway or guidance on whom the required task should be referred to. 7. Instead, the task could be allocated using judgement (although as above, guidance to apply this was not clear) to a clinician who could not in fact assist, which occurred in this case. The jury who heard the inquest found that there was a missed opportunity to review the antibiotics, which was not causative in this case. In my opinion, there is a risk that an urgent need for appropriate clinical referral may not occur in the above circumstances. 6",1,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest hearing on 2 April 2025 at Northamptonshire Coroner's Court.,"The medical cause of death was: I(a) Bronchopneumonia (b) (c) (d) II Liver cirrhosis with hypoalbuminemia, COPD, poor nutritional status The Box 3 findings of the record of inquest were: Linda Farmer died at Northampton General Hospital on 22 August 2023. She had been admitted on 19 August, very unwell, and was swiftly place on a palliative pathway. She died as a result of bronchopneumonia, her death being hastened by other underlying medical conditions and her poor nutritional state. She had had a previous admission to the hospital from 27 June – 16 August. Throughout this admission, her albumin levels had been low, and were consistently falling. At the time of her discharge on 16 August, the cause of this low albumin had not been fully investigated, but this was not probably causative. For at least the four weeks before her discharge on 16 August, Mrs Farmer's oral intake was very low. Additional information for the purpose of this report is that: When Mrs Farmer was re-admitted on 19 August, the clinicians caring for her identified concerns with the care provided in the admission from 27 June – 16 August, namely, in relation to the low albumin levels. These concerns were notified to the Family, and raised with the Medical Examiner at the time","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

He had died on 2 March 2024 in his own home (sheltered accommodation). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was a short narrative of 'accident, with a contribution from natural causes'. The medical cause of his death was I(a) Hypovolaemic Shock (b) Compound Fracture Dislocation of right Tibiotalar (Ankle) Joint (c) (d) II Fatty Liver Disease, Huntington's Disease","(1) YZ was diagnosed with Huntington's Disease in 2019. (2) He died in his own home on 2 March 2024, in the early hours of the morning from extensive blood loss from a traumatic open fracture of the right ankle. (3) He had an emergency careline cord in his home, managed by Appello, which he had activated at 0220 on 2 March. When the operator answered him YZ had spoken initially unintelligibly, and then in response to questions indicated he was ok and did not need help. (4) The call duration was brief. It was logged as an accidental call. (5) YZ did not receive medical assistance and died some time before 0800 the same morning, 2 March 2024. (6) YZ's failure to obtain prompt medical assistance contributed more than minimally to his death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) YZ's presentation with Huntingdon's Disease involved altered pain pathways/responses, slurred speech, lack of or reduced insight, tendency to apathy and self-neglect and impaired cognitive processing. (2) These are aspects of presentation that may be present in a wider group of other end-users of careline services (for example those with dementia) and are not limited to end-users with Huntingdon's Disease. (3) I found there was a missed opportunity to obtain life-saving medical assistance that was attributable to YZ's impairments arising from Huntington's Disease. (4) YZ had called for assistance but the operator failed to identify that he had a major injury with significant blood loss. (5) The interaction was very brief, YZ contributing only a few words, and I found key information might have been elicited if YZ had been given more time, asked to repeat his unintelligible opening words, or had been asked open and/or more specific closed questions. (6) I found the operator who answered the call was trained and had followed the protocols that were in place for him at that time. He was not a clinician. His management of the call was in line with the guidelines applicable to his work (Appello Careline Limited guidelines, and the guidelines of the Telecare Services Association, which are followed by most of the careline services industry). (7) After YZ's death Appello Careline Limited quickly and proactively reviewed their procedures and amended their call protocols. At inquest they accepted the offer of the Huntingdon's Disease Association to work with them to identify questioning methods or protocols that might further reduce the risk of similar outcomes in future. (8) The Telecare Services Association was not a recognised interested person in YZ's inquest. (9) I am bringing a risk formally to their attention with this report. The risk is to careline users with similar presentations as YZ if the Telecare Services Association's guidelines continue unamended.

London. SW1P 4DF. 1","Mr Alexi Susiluoto died on 22/5/24. An investigation into his death was opened on 5/6/24. The inquest was part-head on 27/9/24 and concluded on 31/1/25.

I reached the conclusion that Mr Susiluoto died from an alcohol-related death.","Mr Susiluoto was born in Finland on 16/9/92. He had lived in the UK for several years and had a significant medical history of mental health disorders, substance misuse and epilepsy (following a head injury). At the time of his death, Mr Susiluoto was homeless but being housed by Camden Council in various hotels across London, depending on availability. He continued to suffer from alcohol misuse and had periods of binge drinking. He was under the care of Turning Point for this issue and had previously been reviewed by multiple mental health trusts, depending on his location at the particular time of referral/review. Mr Susiluoto was found deceased in a hotel room on 22/5/24. The cause of his death was alcohol misuse disorder resulting in acute ethanol toxicity. Contributing factors were epilepsy and Olanzepine and Levetiracetam use (prescribed medication).","During the course of this inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Mr Susiluoto's death were as follows: 2 1. I heard evidence that the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities is currently undertaking a review of how patients with dual diagnoses (substance misuse and mental health disorders) are treated. I was concerned by two related issues: a. That substance misuse and mental health treatment is routinely provided by different organisations, despite close interplay between these conditions and that this can result in significant complexities for agencies caring for the same patient. I understand that this aspect is part of the current review; b. However, I also heard that the review is not taking into consideration the additional issues that arise when a patient with dual diagnoses is also homeless. Evidence presented at the inquest set out that this already complex situation is often compounded by homelessness, since individuals are often moved between temporary accommodation and therefore between different mental health trust and substance misuse providers. In Mr Susiluoto's case, this resulted in significant confusion as to who was providing his care and which local authority would fund potential substance misuse treatment. 6 ACTION COULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action could be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the addressees have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 30 May 2025. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner, Mr Susiluoto's family, East London NHS Foundation Trust, Turning Point and Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 March 2025. The medical cause of death was found to be as follows 1a Cardiogenic Shock 1b Myocardial Infarction 1c Coronary Artery Disease The four questions – who, when, where and how were answered as follows Andrew Waters died on 24 May 2024 at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro (RCHT) from complications of an undiagnosed and untreated heart condition following an ambulance delay attributable to a systemic failure related to the whole system of health and social care. Andrew's family made a 999-call requesting an ambulance at 02:37 hours on 24 May 2024, at which time Andrew was exhibiting clear symptoms of a heart attack. The ambulance service allocated a category 2 priority but there were no ambulances available to respond. The ambulance service despatched a taxi at 04:40 hours which collected Andrew who arrived at Royal Cornwall Hospital at 05:37 hours. There was a delay of 3 hours from the original category 2 priority decision to Andy's arrival at RCHT. Andrew went into cardiac arrest almost immediately after arrival at RCHT Emergency Department. Subsequently despite emergency heart surgery the medical team were unable to save Andrew's life. Andrew's heart condition was treatable prior to his cardiac arrest. The impact of the cardiac arrest meant his condition became unsurvivable. The ambulance delay denied Andrew the opportunity of potentially lifesaving treatment. The conclusion of the Inquest was as follows. Andrew died from an undiagnosed and treatable heart condition, following an ambulance delay attributable to a systemic failure related to the whole system of health and social care. The ambulance delay was possibly causative of death in that it denied Andrew potentially lifesaving treatment .","1. The findings of fact on how Andrew died are set out above in the answers to the four statutory questions. 2. The court made findings of fact upon the wider circumstances, namely the systemic failure that was possibly causative of Andrew's death. Significant handover delays 3. At the time of Andrew's 999 call there were 7 ambulances delayed at RCHT due to an inability to handover their patients to the hospital emergency department (ED). 4. In Andrew's case the unavailability of ambulance resources meant that the South West Ambulance Service Trust (SWAST) had to resort to sending a taxi to try and get Andrew to hospital in time. The taxi driver was not informed that the ride was for a patient having a heart attack. Nevertheless, the taxi driver made every effort to get Andrew to hospital as quickly as lawfully possible. 5. The court noted that the national target is for ambulances to handover patients to hospital is within 15 minutes of arrival. 6. At RCHT on 23rd May 2024 the average handover time per patient was one hour, 25 minutes, 46 seconds, with over 101 hours of ambulance time lost to handovers above 15 minutes in duration. This is equivalent to approximately nine ambulance shifts lost to delays (based on a standard 11-hour shift). 7. At RCHT on 24th May 2024 the average handover time was 50 minutes, 20 seconds per patient with over 49 hours of ambulance time lost to handovers above 15 minutes in duration. This is equivalent to approximately four ambulance shifts lost to delays. 8. Data indicates the picture has not improved. Significant average handover delays at RCHT were recorded for every month of 2025 to date. This is a picture reflected across the south west and indeed nationally. 9. The average handover delays conceal spikes such as that which led to the long delay in this case. Such long delays increase the risk of mortality. 10. The court heard evidence of a new policy being implemented by SWAST to try and reduce ambulance resources being tied down in lengthy waits at hospital. After a 90-minute handover delay the ambulance paramedics will give notice to ED that a patient is being left on a trolley, notwithstanding the fact that ED has not formally accepted that patient, and despite evidence of concerns around ED crowding. ED crowding 11. On the day of Andrew's ambulance delay, RCHT ED was at 130% occupancy. ED accommodated these patients on trolleys in corridors, and the rest of the patients would either be seated within the waiting room or remain inside ambulances outside. 12. Similar data was presented to the court for January 2025. 13. EDs have a national target for 95% of patients to be admitted, transferred or discharged within 4 hours. It was noted that there is a recent major study which shows that the standardised mortality rate starts to rise from 5 hours after the patient's time of arrival at the ED and they concluded that after 6–8 hours, there is one extra death for every 82 patients delayed. This increased mortality is partly attributed to the fact that patients in ED are not receiving the surgery or specialist care that is available on the wards. 14. The court found that on 24 May 2024 the hospital failed to meet the 4-hour target for the majority of patients. 15. Recent data indicated there has been no significant improvement on meeting the 4- hour target, with RCHT ED failing to meet that target for the majority of patients. Insufficient social care provision 16. The court found there was insufficient bed availability on acute wards which was attributable to significant numbers of patients in hospital with no reason to reside (NCTR), these being patients who are medically optimised but cannot be discharged due to lack of onward care support. 17. On the day of the ambulance delay, 24 May 2024, almost 20% of patients in RCHT were recorded as NCTR. 18. In January 2025 the proportion of NCTR patients was over 20% of patients in RCHT. 19. The court noted the main cause for the numbers of NCTR patients was insufficient social care provision, whether commissioned by social services or NHS. 20. Investigations in 2022 and 2023 by SWAST and the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) found a direct link between ambulance delays and inadequate social care provision. The court noted the SWAST systems report which found… ''….there is a direct link between patients waiting in the hospital for discharge to social care and patients being cared for inside ambulances and Emergency Departments.'' 21. Data presented to the court indicated that just over 10% of direct social care posts in Cornwall are currently vacant notwithstanding Cornwall Council securing the agreement of social care providers to pay the living wage. This reflects the national picture of just under 10% nationwide vacant direct social care posts. 22. The court noted that the NHS does not carry responsibility for the recruitment and retention of social care staff or any broad obligation to promote the social care market. 23. The HSIB report referred to the fact that the organisations immediately required to deal with ambulance delays are ambulance trusts and acute hospitals, In Cornwall that is SWAST and RCHT. These organisations do not have control over the services primarily responsible for ambulance delays, namely social care provision, primary healthcare provision and community hospital provision. They are unable to influence the whole-system and therefore carry risks that they cannot wholly mitigate or manage. 24. The court noted the HSSIB report which states that delayed discharges (and consequent ambulance delays) are a national issue which is attributed to a whole system failure of health and social care. The court noted the HSSIB investigation's first safety recommendation is an urgent 'whole system' response to reduce patient harm.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Significant handover delays leading to ambulance resources being tied up at hospital with increased risk in mortality for patients in the community waiting for emergency ambulances. (2) ED crowding leading to increased risk in mortality for patients being held in ambulances and corridors and being delayed from receiving surgery or specialist treatment on wards. (3) Insufficient social care provision leading to large numbers of patients in hospital who are otherwise fit for discharge, thereby impeding patient flow through hospital. 6",65,N/A: Not found

The Hoarding Disorder and Executive Dysfunction from which she suffered made a more than minimal contribution to the fire.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Department of Health and Social Care (2023), Care and Support Statutory Guidance, Section 14.17 states in relation to Self Neglect and Hoarding Disorder: “This covers a wide range of behaviour neglecting to care of one's personal hygiene, health or surroundings and includes behaviour such as hoarding. It should be noted that self- neglect may not prompt a section 42 enquiry. An assessment should be made on a case by case basis. A decision on whether a response is required under safeguarding will depend on the adult's ability to protect themselves by controlling their own behaviour. There may come a point when they are no longer able to do this, without external support.” During the course of the evidence I heard from social workers and safeguarding professionals than in relation to assessing whether “the point” had been reached in relation to an adult suffering from Hoarding Disorder and Executive Dysfunction there was no specific guidance and that such guidance would in future be welcome. Currently they are constrained by existing guidance for assessing mental capacity, which does not directly recognise Executive Dysfunction, or for assessing whether the adult's behaviour constitutes Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 a potentially chargeable criminal or regulatory offence, for example in relation to public nuisance, health hazard, or anti social behaviour, rather than the root cause of the behaviour - a mental disorder or disorders. So, the matter of concern consists of this request - for guidance to be provided as to how to incorporate consideration of Executive Dysfunction into the assessment of mental capacity and how to assess when the point when external intervention can be triggered has been reached. 6",54,N/A: Not found

An inquest was opened and adjourned on the 11 th April 2024 and a final inquest took place on the 13 th of February 2025 with conclusions delivered on the 25 th February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: “James Paul Michael MASHETER died on the 1 st April 2024 at his home address by hanging. Mr MASHETER had struggled with his mental health and had previously engaged in self-injurious behaviours. On the 31 st March 2024, Mr MASHETER made a number of cuts to himself with a knife and telephoned friends telling them he was dying and asking for help. Mr MASHETER's friends called for an ambulance and one friend attended his home address. Mr MASHETER was distressed and bleeding from superficial wounds. Due to demands of the service, there were significant delays in ambulance allocation but Mr MASHETER's friend was told that that delay was significantly less than was the case. Believing an ambulance to be arriving imminently, the friend left Mr MASHETER, who went on to secure a ligature which caused his death. Incorrect information about the waiting times for ambulance attendance was provided to Mr MASHETER's friend and this contributed to his death. It is not possible to determine Mr MASHETER's intentions at the time at which he secured the ligature given his behaviour was in the context of a significant mental health crisis”.","Mr James Masheter was a 42-year-old man with a history of self-injurious behaviour when in a mental health crisis. Prior to his death, a relationship had ended and he had financial concerns. On the 31 st March 2024, Mr Masheter telephoned his friend and ask for help as he was “dying”. His friend telephoned 999 and requested an ambulance. The request was triage as a category 3 incident. There were 3 further calls to the ambulance service on the evening of the 31 st March 2024. All resulted under the triage systems as a category 3. There were also significant delays in resource availability on this night. In the final 999 call, Mr Masheter's friend was told there were delays of one and a half hours and his original call was one hour ten minutes ago. Believing the ambulance to be due imminently, the friend left. The ambulance did not arrive until 08:10am on the 1 st April 2024 and the crew found Mr Masheter deceased by hanging.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The NHS Pathways system is used for triage. This asks standard questions to ascertain the seriousness of the situation including whether the patient is awake and breathing and so on. The triage pathway includes some options for mental health situations but these are limited. Evidence was heard in the inquest that the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) had liaised with NHS Pathways with a view to exploring how mental health calls are triaged. NHS Pathways declined to make any changes to mental health triage but offered advice to NWAS in how to triage mental health situations. 2. The evidence heard at the inquest was that notwithstanding the seriousness of the situation in which Mr Masheter presented, his appropriate categorisation was category 3. This led to significant delays in an ambulance attending. It is not clear to me whether it is possible for serious mental health crisis situations which present a risk to life are capable of being properly risk assessed on the basis of the NHS Pathways mental health triage which exists at present. 6.",42,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest hearing on 25 March 2025 at Exeter Coroner's Court, in the County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay Coroner Area. 4","Mary Pomeroy was a frail 89 year old female who suffered fatal traumatic injuries that were inflicted upon her (following being pushed over and falling to the ground) by a fellow in-patient on their shared ward at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth in March 2022. Section 2 of the Record of Inquest (which recorded the medical cause of Mary Pomeroy's death) was determined as: 1a – combined physiological effects of bilateral humeral fractures in an elderly patient 1b – traumatic fall to ground following being pushed over Section 3 of the Record of Inquest (which answered how, when and where Mary Pomeroy came by her death) was determined as: 'Mary Pomeroy was an in-patient at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth when, on 3 March 2022, she was pushed over on to the floor by a fellow patient who had been suffering with psychotic symptoms and cognitive and behavioural problems. Mary suffered fractures as a result of this trauma. Mary's condition deteriorated after, and as a direct result of, this incident, and she died on 15 March 2022 at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth. There was a lack of assessment and management of the patient who pushed Mary over and this materially contributed to the incident occurring and therefore to Mary's death.' Section 4 of the Record of Inquest (which provided the conclusion as to Mary Pomeroy's death) was determined, in narrative form, as: 'Mary Pomeroy died from injuries suffered following being pushed over by a fellow patient on the same ward in hospital – this fellow patient had psychiatric, behavioural and cognitive difficulties and wasn't being closely supervised on the ward.' 5","During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Derriford Hospital in Plymouth is the main acute hospital site managed by UHP NHS. UHP NHS carried out a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) investigation in respect of the circumstances which led to Mary Pomeroy being pushed to the ground by a fellow patient on a ward at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth and her death thereafter. This investigation culminated in a written investigation report which was given executive sign off on 14 July 2022, by the SI panel chair and chief nurse of UHP NHS. The main body of the investigation report concluded that the incident which led to Mary Pomeroy being pushed to the ground by a fellow patient was 'a rare and devastating accident for which could not have been foreseen'. The summary of the SI Panel Meeting Review, chaired by the Chief Nurse on 4 July 2022, stated that 'overall it was considered that [the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy] was managed appropriately during his admission to UHP NHS and concluded that this was a deeply unfortunate accident, but not one that could have been anticipated and therefore prevented by staff.' The inquest heard evidence that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy to the ground on 3 March 2022 had done almost exactly the same thing to another patient on the ward only two days previously, on 1 March 2022 – this incident was discussed in the main body of the RCA investigation report, but not referred to at all in the SI Panel Meeting Review summary. The inquest also heard evidence that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy had been involved in a number of incidents where he had used physical force on staff members on the ward in February 2022. At the inquest, the author of UHP NHS's investigation report (who was the Matron of the relevant ward) accepted, in evidence, that the patient who pushed Mary Pomeroy should, on 3 March 2022, have been subject to enhanced observations of care – this was on the basis that previous assessments in November 2021 and January 2022 had shown that this was required for him owing to his psychiatric and behavioural presentation (which had become more concerning by the end of February/beginning of March 2022) and also because of very recent and specific concerns regarding his behaviour which should have been obvious to ward staff following the incident on 1 March 2022. The Matron accepted, in evidence, that had enhanced observation and care been in place for the patient (which could have taken a number of forms following assessment, depending on what would have been most clinically and therapeutically appropriate at the time) then he should have been prevented from being in a position where he was able to push Mary Pomeroy to the ground on 3 March 2022. The Matron accepted, in evidence, that UHP NHS's RCA report had been incorrect to conclude that the type of incident that occurred on 3 March 2022 could not have been foreseen. The Deputy Chief Nurse of UHP NHS accepted, in evidence, that the SI Panel Meeting should have interrogated the relevant facts and chronology more. The inquest determined that the incident on the ward on 3 March 2022 was foreseeable, based on the concerns about the patient's behaviour, the likely triggers for him becoming distressed and aggressive and the almost identical incident that had occurred on 1 March 2022. The inquest also determined that the lack of assessment and management of this patient's behaviour and needs materially contributed to the incident which led to Mary Pomeroy suffering injuries and led to her death. It is unfortunately clear, when comparing the evidence heard at the inquest with the findings of UHP NHS's RCA report, that there was inadequate analysis of this serious incident by UHP NHS, with concerning circumstances surrounding the care provided not being identified – therefore appropriate recommendations to inform future care provision were not given consideration as part of the RCA investigation/report. If UHP NHS do not identify concerning matters when carrying out internal investigations and do not take steps to try and learn from serious incidents when they occur, then there is an obvious, significant and continuing risk of future deaths occurring arising out of healthcare provision provided. 6",89,N/A: Not found

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Firstly, I heard evidence from the family that nursing staff were frequently unable to administer Naloxone as it had run out. They had to obtain more Naloxone from the pharmacy, which led to delays for “hours and hours” on multiple occasions. Secondly, I heard evidence concerning a lack of awareness or appreciation concerning the risk of opioid toxicity / accumulation in patients with kidney impairment/failure, even where the “correct” dose may have been given. I am concerned that if there is no proper or properly implemented system for obtaining medication in a timely manner, and limited awareness of the matters canvassed above, then this gives rise to a risk of future deaths. 6",88,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 March 2025. Derrick's cause of death was 1a. acute traumatic right-sided subdural haemorrhage, 2. anticoagulant therapy, ischaemic coronary heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, status post aortic aneurysm repair (2008; 2021). I made a determination at inquest of accident.","Derrick Frederick Tully was found deceased at his home address on the evening of 20 March 2024. He had suffered a massive traumatic subdural haemorrhage. He'd been suffering from falls in the months leading up to his death following a decline in his health and diagnosis of vascular dementia in October 2023. He had background history that included strokes in 2016 and 2021 which left him with weakness and dysphasia. He also had hypertension, chronic kidney disease, repaired aortic aneurysms, and paranoid disorder. From February 2023 Derrick had been living in temporary accommodation following a homeless application. After a mental health crisis in-patient admission in May 2023, he declined rapidly. From at least January 2024, Derrick began suffering multiple falls and was getting muddled with his medication. In February 2024 the rapid response team raised concerns about him with his GP and suggested that he required supported housing. His case was discussed at integrated network MDT meetings. Derrick had a very supportive family but they were also providing care to their terminally ill mother. On the day that Derrick was found deceased, carers had been unable to contact him in the morning or the evening. They had no way of accessing his accommodation if he didn't answer.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Islington Housing Options Derrick was provided with a wheeled walker to reduce the risk of falls. Although's Derrick's temporary accommodation was ground floor, there were steps down from the building to street level and he was thus unable to manoeuvre the walker out of the property. Despite a social care letter of support, outlining concerns that his current accommodation was unsuitable and detailing Derrick's health problems, the housing options team did not award him any medical points. Derrick required carers twice a day. He was also given a pendant alarm for emergencies. However, no key safe was installed meaning that even in an emergency, neither carers nor emergency services could gain entry to his flat. This was raised repeatedly by his family, carers and other professionals. Islington Adult Social Services On discharge from hospital on 3 February 2024 following a fall, Derrick was provided with a good package of care. On 23 February this changed to a reablement package. Derrick was not suitable for reablement because of his declining cognition and progressive dementia. The occupational therapist raised concerns that he was not suitable for reablement for these reasons and because there were no rehabilitation goals. There was an over-reliance on Derrick's self- reporting which was inaccurate given his memory problems, and a 3 focus on him doing more for himself. He began losing weight because he was not eating, and he was not able to cope with self-care. Daryel Care & Islington Adult Social Services On 20 February Derrick suffered a fall. Severe bruising and swelling developed on his face over the following days but this was not recorded in his care notes by his carers and not escalated until his daughter raised concerns on 24 February. “No concerns” was written in Derrick's care record and no consideration given to whether he needed to be reviewed by a doctor. Integrated Community Aging Team, Whittington Health Following MDT meetings due to concerns over Derrick's increasing deterioration and ability to cope with his own care needs, the Integrated Community Aging Team reviewed him on 6 March. They discharged him from the service on 12 March because he did not want to engage with their home assessment of him. Derrick was suffering from cognitive impairment as a result of previous strokes and newly diagnosed dementia. He also had a mental health history and was paranoid. This was compounded by problems he'd experienced with neighbours and cuckooing concerns meaning that at times, he didn't feel safe at home. It does not appear that these were factored into his inability to engage with the team. 6",61,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 March 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a) Metastatic Prostate Cancer and Emphysema 1b) 1c) 2) The conclusion of the inquest was: Natural causes,"Derek Cole was diagnosed with prostate cancer after he had raised PSA (prostate specific antigen) marker levels which rapidly increased over a short period of time. An initial bone scan in December 2023 showed no evidence of metastatic spread, but a further scan on 7 May 2024 showed extensive metastatic disease. He was admitted to hospital on 27 May 2024 and was found to have raised inflammatory markers and an acute kidney injury secondary to infection. He was treated and improved sufficiently that he was fit for discharge, pending a package of care being sourced. While awaiting this he had a suspected chest infection which was also treated and from which he recovered. He was discharged to Dereham Hospital on 15 June 2024 for rehabilitation. In the early hours of 16 June 2024, he was found unresponsive in bed and in line with previously expressed wishes, no resuscitation measures were undertaken. The findings on the evidence heard included that a GP appropriately referred Mr Cole to the hospital Urology team in November 2023 due to high PSA of 25.6 (I was advised anything over 10 in a gentleman of Mr Cole's age is to be referred). He was seen by the Urology team in December 2023 and a bone scan showed no evidence of metastasis, which was reassuring, and they requested that the GP perform a further PSA test in 2 months, and this was done on 12 January 2024 and the result was slightly raised from the earlier test at 37. There was then a further PSA test in February which showed what a Urologist who gave evidence described as a significant raise to 156.3. His evidence was that this was an unusually high rise in a short period of time for a man in his 80s. This was therefore something which should have been flagged up immediately to the Urology team by the GP receiving the result, but it was not as they believed (but were unable to explain why) he had a follow up appointment shortly with urology and that they would see the result then. There was then another test in April, with a PSA which was said to be very high at 510. At this time a check was made by a GP that there was a follow up appointment in place, and this led to a further bone scan which was done 7 May 2024 and confirmed multiple metastases. Had the results from February 2024 been flagged to Urology, on the balance of probabilities, Mr Cole would have undergone further tests at the hospital to check the PSA raise was genuine, which it would have been, and treatment would have started in February or early March. This would have been the same treatment as was later started in May. The evidence in this case was that the extent and speed of the spread was very rare in a man of Mr Cole's age, and this was due to it being an aggressive form of the cancer and that, on the balance of probabilities, earlier commencement of treatment would not have altered the outcome or changed the treatment options which were suitable.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. It was accepted that the GP practice, when asked to perform tests by secondary services, should notify them of the results if they are abnormal. It was accepted that it should be confirmed in such circumstances that a follow up appointment is in place and considered whether any abnormal results should lead to a request for a more urgent review. It was also accepted that there was learning for the practice regarding this and that this could be discussed at a Significant Event meeting. However, despite Mr Cole dying in June 2024, at the time of inquest, 9 months later no such meeting or learning had taken place. While the evidence is that earlier specialist input would not have altered the outcome for Mr Cole, it is a concern that for other patients, a delay may impact upon their treatment options and prognosis. 2. The evidence was that any clinician could identify a concern for these meetings, or that usually it was for the Practice Manager to raise these when they were aware of a concern. The Practice were aware of the concerns as the inquest was listed and concerns raised by the family about delays were sent to the Practice to consider when providing their evidence for the inquest. However, this still did not trigger a review or any learning. It is therefore a concern that the Practice does not have a sufficient system in place to learn from such events which creates a risk that future deaths may occur in similar circumstances. 6",81,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 st March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Peter David Konitzer died on 24 th August 2016 as a result of compression of the chest. The jury concluded that the deceased had been unlawfully killed.,"Peter David Konitzer worked as a volunteer for Wilts & Berks Canal Trust in relation to a project to rehabilitate the top lock of the Wilts and Berks canal at Pewsham. The work involved elements of heavy construction outside the experience and capabilities of the volunteer workforce employed. Senior management of the canal trust failed to manage the project in an efficient and legally compliant manner partly through ignorance of their legal responsibilities. Mr Konitzer died when removing props behind a recently excavated retaining wall which collapsed onto him. As a result of senior management failures to manage the project in a manner so as to preserve the safety of those involved in the execution of the works the trust was prosecuted and pleaded guilty. There appeared to be lack of understanding by the trust of the legal obligations set by the Construction Design Management Regulations and little appreciation of relevant standards and guidance such as are to be found by reference to British Standards and HSE Guidance. In particular there was ignorance of the requirement for temporary works designs, risk assessments and method statements and the need to have completed full designs, project identification documents, construction phase plans, including health and safety plans and risk assessments, prior to starting work.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 2 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The HSE website has a section on Volunteering which provides links to more detailed sections elsewhere on the website. No where is it emphasised that as a matter of good practice before undertaking any construction work risk assessments and method statements should be in writing even when there is no legal requirement to do so. Many charitable trusts have a large number of volunteers working for them but with under 5 actual employees technically escape the legal requirements for such documents to be in writing. 2. Subsequent to the conviction of the Canal Trust for breaches of health and safety legislation the HSE published a bulletin. Will consideration be given to publishing a further bulletin following the finding of the inquest jury that Peter Konitzer was unlawfully killed? Such a bulletin might serve as a stark warning to others embarking on similar projects. 3. Will thought be given to revising the Volunteering section of the website to provide a more comprehensive and standalone guide to the obligations of charitable trusts and voluntary organisations? Might such revision profitably include a section reminding organisations that rely on volunteers that enthusiasm should be tempered by being mindful of the need to obtain proper professional advice and assistance in appropriate circumstances? 6,63,N/A: Not found

(via email to his legal representative) , Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing (via ) 1","From 3 rd March to 24 th March 2025, evidence was heard before a jury touching the death of Mr Oladeji Adeyemi Omishore. He had died on the 4 th June 2022, aged 41 years, in ITU at St Thomas's Hospital. He had died following an incident involving police officers on Chelsea Bridge during which he was tasered a number of times and then jumped into the River Thames. Medical Cause of Death 1 a. Complications arising from drowning How, when, where and in what circumstances the deceased came by his death; and conclusions as recorded by the jury [in this case by combining boxes 3 and 4 of the Record of Inquest] : On 4 th June 2022, Mr Omishore was suffering with a relapse of schizoaffective disorder/psychosis. In October 2019 he had suffered his first episode of schizoaffective disorder/psychosis based on medical evidence we have heard and accepted. He continued to receive care and deemed stable by the health care team in March 2022. Recent cannabis use likely caused or contributed to this relapse of his illness. We have considered and noted his previous behaviour when psychiatrically unwell. Mr Omishore left his home on the morning of 4 th June 2022 shouting in the middle of the road and waving what is now known to be a firelighter. This prompted a number of 999 calls from members of the public. Amongst other things, the public raised shouting religious remarks, a perceived weapon, aggressive behaviour and that he seemed mentally unwell. The call handlers determined critical information and passed to dispatchers which included location, weapon and description, with all calls being graded I grade (immediate response). Responding police officers were told by dispatchers the location, suspicious circumstances, weapons and a brief description via the airwaves. Mental health (MH) was not passed over the airwaves. We note from witnesses this should and could have been passed over the airwaves. The call was accepted by the responding officers at 09:03:54. It was accepted 20 seconds after it was put over the airwaves. The response officers understood they were responding to an I grade call on Chelsea Bridge Road, which they were aware had at least 3 I grades. When the response officers arrived, Mr Omishore was in the middle of the road on the North side of Chelsea Bridge when the officers first saw him. The officers perceived him to be holding a screwdriver. The taser trained officer gave evidence to say he did not initially consider possible MH issues. The non-taser trained officer gave evidence he did consider MH issues during the incident. The response officers gave evidence that they believed this was a genuine threat and took a risk assessment in line with NDM. The response officers arrived at 09:05:43 and the taser officer got out the car with taser drawn and shouted commands to identify himself as a police officer and to draw attention to the taser. Following lack of compliance to drop the object, the taser officer fired the first taser at 09:06:15, in response to non-compliance and movement in the direction of the ono-taser officer. Mr Omishore dropped to the ground and dropped the object. Following the first taser, Mr Omishore was rolling around on the ground and was not under control. The non-taser officer kicked the object away from reach. Mr Omishore attempted to get up and swiped towards the non taser officer and there was a second discharge. The second taser did not allow control of Mr Omishore. Following the third taser discharge, Mr Omishore got up and jumped over the pedestrian barrier. The non- taser officer followed. Mr Omishore swung his hand towards the non-taser officer and knocked the handcuffs out of his hand. The taser officer deployed the second and final cartridge to stop Mr Omishore. Mr Omishore jumped off Chelsea Bridge and into the River Thames at 09:06:53-55. He was rescued at 09:18 and was given CPR and taken to St Thomas's Hospital. He was recognised as life extinct on ITU at St Thomas's Hospital at 20:29 on 4 th June 2022. Matters that we find possibly caused or contributed to the death. Despite the response officers having all required training, the use of the taser did not achieve full NMI. Had the officers been able to achieve full NMI, there is a possibility they could have gained control of Mr Omishore and therefore the inability to achieve full NMI and gain control of Mr Omishore possibly contributed to his death. Information from members of the public (that in their opinion Mr Omishore was suffering from a mental health crisis) was not passed to responding officers before they arrived at the scene. We have heard evidence that such information should and could have been passed on. We have also heard evidence from the responding officers that such information would not have changed their approach. The majority of the jury find that, had mental health concerns been passed over the airwaves, it is possible this may have had an impact on the sequence of events that may have contributed to Mr Omishore's death. Probable Causes Mr Omishore had suffered a relapse of schizoaffective disorder/psychosis and was severely unwell. This illness affected his understanding and was the likely cause of his actions on Chelsea Bridge Road and Chelsea Bridge prior to and after the arrival of thepolice. It is likely that he was frightened by what he was seeing and what he thought he was seeing and lacked insight. Whilst the body worn and phone footage show him running away from police after he had been tasered for the third time, it cannot be concluded that the actions of the police probably caused his death.","on 4th June 2022, Mr Omishore was suffering with a relapse of schizoaffective disorder/psychosis.

Matters that we find possibly caused or contributed to the death.

Despite the response officers having all required training, the use of the taser did not achieve full NMI. Had the officers been able to achieve full NMI, there is a possibility they could have gained control of Mr Omishore and therefore the inability to achieve full NMI and gain control of Mr Omishore possibly contributed to his death.

We have heard evidence that such information should and could have been passed on. We have also heard evidence from the responding officers that such information would not have changed their approach.

The majority of the jury find that, had mental health concerns been passed over the airwaves, it is possible this may have had an impact on the sequence of events that may have contributed to Mr Omishore's death.

Probable Causes

Mr Omishore had suffered a relapse of schizoaffective disorder/psychosis and was severely unwell. This illness affected his understanding and was the likely cause of his actions on Chelsea Bridge Road and Chelsea Bridge prior to and after the arrival of the police. It is likely that he was frightened by what he was seeing and what he thought he was seeing and lacked insight.

Whilst the body worn and phone footage show him running away from police after he had been tasered for the third time, it cannot be concluded that the actions of the police probably caused his death.","Matters of Concern

1. That there is an inconsistency of approach between call handlers/first responders in the recording of information passed to them by members of the public that may represent a training issue; in this case the mental health matters reported to them.

2. That the call handlers/ first responders may have a training issue in relation to the importance of recording this information in manner which is likely to be passed on to responding officers by dispatchers, for example in the NICL codes and/ or ""golden line"".

3. That the above concern of potential training need is highlighted by the increased use of taser in black men and those suffering mental health issues and so the real need for this information to be recorded and passed on in the most effective form. Whilst training for first responders appears to include advice as how to communicate with persons suffering with mental health issues, it does not appear to contain any advice in relation to the importance of such information to be recorded especially in relation to black men.

4. That the limitation of 3 NICL codes makes it difficult to record mental health as a qualifier in incidents such as this where the main risk factor is the weapon.

5. That call handlers/first responders may need training as to where to record such information i.e. in the ""golden line"" or NCIL code, as long as of course it is reported to them before the ""golden line"" and NICL code has gone out.

6. That use of THRIVE usually requires time that is not available in I grade calls and does not mitigate the need to circulate promptly information as to mental health issues, in the format most likely to digested and passed on by dispatchers that is ""golden line"" or NICL codes.

7. That the lack of NICL code ""mental health believed"" compounds this.

8. That dispatchers may require training in relation to the importance of passing on possible mental health concerns for the subject over the airwaves given the increased use of taser in black men and those suffering with mental ill health.

9. That dispatchers may require training in relation to what to pass out more generally given the confusion in the evidence about other units being assigned by CAD, which dispatchers themselves did not seen to appreciate and understand let alone pass such information out to responding officers.

10. That there are apparent system failure issues in dispatcher pods if due to pressure of work, important issues such as mental health concerns for the subject are being missed and the number of units on the way are not being passed over the airwaves, given the potential importance of these matters to responding officers when applying their NDMs, and the reliance of responding officers on the information that they receive over the radio on their way to an I grade call.

11. That training for response officers may require review in relation to tactical options used to de-escalate prior to taser deployment, in appropriate circumstances, given the increased use of taser in black men with mental health issues; and in particular, training in relation to deploying with taser drawn and pointed with accompanying commanding language where the subject may be suffering with mental ill-health.",41,N/A: Not found

This was particularly apparent when mental health staff were seeking an interpreter at short notice for a patient who was in crisis. The lack of interpreters available has meant that urgent assessments are being carried out with no interpreters present. The overall lack of British Sign Language Interpreters has also meant that this Inquest has itself had to be delayed/adjourned for two months due to there being no available Interpreters to interpreter for two deaf witnesses over the two week period of the Inquest. 6,25,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Open.,"Claire Louise Driver had a past medical history of schizoaffective disorder and polysubstance misuse. She had been known to mental health services since 2011 and was first admitted to hospital in 2014. She had a lengthy hospital admission between 2018 and 2021 and on discharge was supported by a care co-ordinator from the enhanced community mental health team. By May 2023 she had started to disengage with that team. She was seen by her care co-ordinator on 28 November 2023 whilst in police custody and was not displaying any signs of psychosis. On 5 December 2023 the enhanced community mental health team were contacted by a PCSO reporting Claire was stealing from local shops. A home visit on 7 December 2023 from the enhanced community mental health team was unsuccessful. On 8 December 2023 Claire's former partner contacted the enhanced community mental health team reporting concerns for her welfare and that she was being sexually exploited. On 13 December 2023 a housing officer called the enhanced community mental health team to raise concerns about Claire. On 15 December 2023 a housing officer called the enhanced community mental health team to say Claire was intoxicated and there were concerns around substance and alcohol misuse. On 16 December 2023 Claire was arrested for indecent exposure. She was intoxicated. She was not seen by the enhanced community mental health team whilst in police custody. On 11 January 2024 the enhanced community mental health team and fire service visited Claire's address and could not gain access. On 16 January 2024 Claire was arrested. She was assessed under the Mental Health Act and detained under s2, and later s3. During that admission her medication was optimised, she began to engage with treatment, and her symptoms began to improve along with her insight into her condition. She began to take leave in preparation for discharge. She was seen in the community by the enhanced community mental health team on 5 May 2024 and discharged from hospital on 7 May 2024. Post discharge she maintained the allocation of a care co-ordinator from the enhanced community mental health team. Following initial unsuccessful attempts at contact, Claire was seen on 13 May, 14 May and 21 May 2024. She was concerned about side effects from her medication and was reluctant to take it. She was also seen to be drinking beer. After several failed visits she was last seen on 1 June 2024 when no concerns were raised, albeit the enhanced community mental health team did not enter her flat or conduct a lengthy visit. On 13 June 2024 she was arrested and taken to Court where she was granted bail. Claire was reported missing to South Yorkshire Police on 24 June 2024 She was assessed as a medium risk and missing person enquiries began. The last sighting of her by a member of the public was on 24 June 2024. On 2 July 2024 she was reassessed as a high risk missing person due to the amount of time she had been without her medication and that others had been found to be accessing her bank account. A dedicated investigation team was formed and a twenty two day search commenced covering an area 7.8 square miles in and around Silkstone. On 29 July 2024 she was moved to the long-term missing portfolio and presumed to be deceased. On 14 September 2024 Claire was found in a state of significant decomposition in a shallow stream in woodland off Kinemoor Lane, Silkstone in Barnsley. She was identified by her fingerprints. The cause of death at post mortem examination was: 1a. Unascertained.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The inquest heard there were only two attempts to see Claire by the enhanced community mental health team between 28 November 2023, when she was seen in police custody, and 16 January 2024, when she was detained under the Mental Health Act, despite clear evidence her mental health was deteriorating. It was accepted in evidence a more assertive approach to attempt to engage Claire, and in complex cases generally, could have been used and there could have been better liaison between the police and the enhanced community mental health team when Claire was in custody. A more assertive approach and better liaison could have prevented Claire relapsing to such an extent she needed to be detained under the Mental Health Act. (2) The inquest heard that training on the effect of substance misuse on mental health conditions is not mandatory for all staff and would be of assistance when caring for patients such as Claire. 6",48,N/A: Not found

The British Society of Gastroenterology",On 5 th June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Alexander GLOVER The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 th March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:- Naturally occurring strangulation of a hiatus hernia with delayed surgical intervention resulting from an earlier missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a Multi-organ Failure 1b Strangulated Hiatus Hernia and Ischaemic Stomach,"Thomas Glover's death was recognised at 21:00 on 22 nd May 2024, at the Bloomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, in Essex. Tom had been transferred from the Ipswich Hospital to the Broomfield Hospital on the 16 th April 2024, following the delayed presentation of a strangulated hiatus hernia with an ischaemic stomach. Tom underwent a number of emergency surgeries at the Broomfield Hospital, which were ultimately unsuccessful. Tom developed multi-organ failure, and was commenced on end-of-life care until his death on the 22 nd May 2024. On the 13 th April 2024 Tom had attended the Ipswich Hospital with vomiting symptoms indicative of a gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and intestines. Tom was admitted onto an assessment unit for observations overnight. On the 14 th April 2024 Tom was reviewed by a Doctor at around 11:00, and was deemed to be clinically well enough for discharge. Tom was discharged at around 17:00 on the 14 th April 2024. On the afternoon of 15 th April 2024 Tom became acutely unwell and returned to the Ipswich Hospital, where he suffered a cardiac arrest. Once resuscitated he was diagnosed with a strangulated hiatus hernia and transferred by blue light ambulance to Broomfield Hospital. Despite intensive care unit support and emergency surgeries, Tom had suffered irreversible damage to his gastrointestinal system, from which he could not survive. Prior to his discharge on the 14 th April 2024, Tom had continued to vomit and looked unwell, but this information was not escalated to the discharging clinician. Had this information been escalated, it is more likely than not that Tom would have not been discharged. Tom's discharge on the 14 th April 2024 led to a missed opportunity to diagnose Tom's strangulated hiatus hernia at the time it developed, delaying any subsequent treatment. Whether or not an earlier diagnose of Tom's strangulated hiatus hernia would have prevented the tragic outcome, could not be established on the available evidence.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you;
the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows. -

1. At inquest it was heard in evidence Tom was suffering from a hiatus hernia, which is a common condition suffered by up to 60% of the population in middle and later life. In the majority of cases a hiatus hernia is asymptomatic, and an individual can be unaware of its presence.

Evidence identified there are two types of hiatus hernia.

a) A sliding hiatus hernia, which moves up and down through the naturally occurring hole in the diaphragm, and therefore in and out of the chest area, and;

b) A para-oesophageal hiatus hernia (also called a rolling hiatus hernia) where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus and stays there.

In the population over 80% of those individuals who suffer from this condition have a sliding hiatus hernia, whilst only between 5-15% will have a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia.

The difference between the two types of hiatus hernia is import, as the para-oesophageal hiatus hernia is far more likely to develop known complications, and therefore more likely to require surgery.

2. However, it was heard in evidence that in England many non-gastro specialist medical clinicians within the NHS are unaware of the difference in the two types of hiatus hernia, and are therefore unaware of the additional risk posed to the 5-15% of patients with a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia.

3. It was heard in evidence that the NHS England online guidance makes no distinction between the two types of hiatus hernias, whereas the guidance for NHS Scotland does.

4. As a result, the lack of understanding of the difference between the two types of hiatus hernia within the medical community means that there is no increased vigilance taken when individuals with a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia present with symptoms.

5. In addition, the cohort of individuals who suffer from para-oesophageal hiatus hernia in England, are unaware of the increased risk posed by their condition and are therefore unable to advocate for more testing, or seek a second opinion when worrying symptoms do arise.",65,N/A: Not found

NHS Lancashire and South Cumbria Integrated Care Board 4. NHS England",The investigation into Ida Jean Lock was opened on 24 November 2020 The inquest into Ida Jean Lock was opened on 27 May 2021 The inquest was concluded on 21 March 2025 following 19 days of evidence.,"[REDACTED], who was pregnant with her daughter, Ida, attended Royal Lancaster Infirmary Labour Ward, operated by University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, on 8 November 2019 when she should have been offered induction of labour to provider additional monitoring during delivery. [REDACTED] re-attended the Labour Ward on 9 November 2019 when due to a report of reduced foetal movements, she should have received obstetric care and additional monitoring during delivery. During the course of the labour on 9 November 2019 there were multiple missed opportunities for enhanced care and obstetric input including a failure to act on bloodstained liquor, a rising foetal heart rate before 10 am, failing to act on clinical signs that made it inadvisable for [REDACTED] to enter the birthing pool, failure to act on a significant slowing of the baby's heart at 10:15 am, a lack of urgency both in asking [REDACTED] to leave the pool and on obtaining CTG monitoring equipment, failing to summon obstetric help at an appropriate time, the midwives becoming task focused on obtaining a foetal heart rate and deriving reassurance from unreliable heart rate readings that lead to avoidable delay. The obstetric delivery of Ida was of high quality but, due to the delay involving obstetricians, Ida was born pale in colour with a low heart rate and severe hypoxic ischaemic brain damage. The initial resuscitation for 3 ½ minutes led by the Labour Ward Coordinator was wholly ineffectual and Ida's condition at the time of arrival of the paediatric registrar was consistent with ineffective ventilation where chest rise could not be seen, the heart rate was less than 60 bpm and she was grey in colour. The paediatric registrar took over the resuscitation, Ida responded quickly to ventilation and from this point onwards the resuscitation was of high quality. The conclusion of the inquest is as follows: On 9 November 2019 [REDACTED], who was pregnant with Ida, attended the Royal Lancaster Infirmary Labour Ward in early labour. Ida was a normal child whose death was caused by a lack of oxygen during her delivery that occurred due to the gross failure of the three midwives attending her to provide basic medical care to deliver Ida urgently when it was apparent she was in distress and contributed to by the lead midwife's wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation for Ida during the first 3 1/2 minutes of her life that further contributed to Ida's brain damage from which she died on 16 November 2019 at the Royal Preston Hospital neonatal intensive care unit. The inquest was one in which Article 2 was fully engaged as a result of the Trust's clinical governance arrangements, inadequate investigations, a lack of transparency and openness, a failure to respond to a detailed complaint letter, a failure to comply with the Duty of Candour, disputing the findings of the Secretary of State for Health's independent review panel (HSIB now MNSI), failing to notify external monitoring bodies and failing to comply with internal protocols. The Trust's lack of compliance with clinical governance requirements in the investigation into Ida's death had significant similarities with the criticisms made in 2015 of the Trust as set out in The Report of the Morecambe Bay Investigation, otherwise known as the Kirkup Report. [REDACTED] who gave evidence at the inquest, expressed the view that there was a deep seated and endemic culture of defensiveness in respect of maternity incidents at the Trust. [REDACTED] also said that the investigation showed elements of failing to identify significant care issues, brevity, defensiveness and was conducted by unskilled investigators. During the course of the Investigation NHS Resolutions, an arm's length body of the Department of Health and Social Care obtain independent reports to disagree with the independent body established by the Secretary of State for Health to investigate maternal and baby adverse and unexpected incidents. The detailed review of the evidence heard at the inquest is set out in a 60-page summing up dealing with the clinical care and clinical governance issues.","During the course of the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

's evidence to the inquest was that a deep-seated and endemic culture within the Trust leads to denial and a failure to learn. 's Investigation report was published in 2015, the Trust is ten years on and still issues and themes identified in 2015 were very much in issue in 2019 and still exist at the Trust as identified by Ida's inquest. 3. The Trust's approach to the inquest has been one of a lack of transparency and openness, failure to provide relevant information and a failure to identify with candour the defective clinical governance processes that have operated at the Trust from 2019 to present day. 4. The Trust did not disclose that they had failed to notify the external bodies namely the CQC and the then CCG [ICB] via STEIS and the Trust's internal Serious Incidents Reporting Investigation panel, none of which was noted by the Trust's Patient Safety Summits .The matter was reported to the Coroner a year after Ida's death by the family after the Trust took no action to do so, despite being on notice of failures in treatment from the HSIB report Ida's harm was at no point categorised by the Trust as a harm event that caused “death”. 5. Trust figures to the Board provided in 2025 stated that there were no complaints over 6 months old when the Trust at the time of the inquest have not responded to and 's 1 June 2020 complaint., Together Coroner's Court, 2 Faraday Court, Faraday Drive, Fulwood, Preston, PR2 9NB Tel: (01772) 536536 with the Trust's failure to categorise Ida's death as only ""Moderate Harm"" (see point 4 above) cause me also to have concern about the reliability of Trust's data. B: Clinical Governance and Maternity Governance [Trust, ICB and DHSC] 6. I consider the clinical governance arrangements at the Trust require urgent review to ensure the appropriate personnel are in place, with the necessary training and skills to deliver robust clinical governance to ensure patient safety in maternity care. 7. As a result of the Trust's deficient processes, the Trust did not undertake any examination of its own clinical governance processes, which were a principle area of concern and which was identified to the Trust five months before the inquest commenced. The Trust's clinical governance arrangements were extracted piecemeal during the course of the inquest. The deficiencies included lack of version control and audit of documents, untrained staff, chaotic clinical governance arrangements, defensive attitudes and inappropriate self- congratulation. The clinicians' reports to the inquest only answered the questions they were asked rather than trying to assist with a holistic view of the evidence, did not provide relevant information until it was extracted from the witness in testimony, that resulted in rolling disclosure of documents and additional witness evidence. This approach caused additional distress to the family who had to sit through an extended court hearing to address these issues 8. is now Head of Compliance and Assurance at the Trust but that there has been no investigation into her role in respect of reneging on the Trust's acceptance of the HSIB report at senior management level and with the family as was indicated by her approval of the July 2021 position statement. Similarly, is now Head of Midwifery at the Trust and there has been no investigation in respect of her disputing the HSIB findings and submission of challenge to the HSIB report in Ida's case. Coroner's Court, 2 Faraday Court, Faraday Drive, Fulwood, Preston, PR2 9NB Tel: (01772) 536536 9. All investigations conducted by the Trust to date in respect of Ida's death have been unskilled, superficial, brief, failed to identify issues and left the family without answers and were all features identified by the 2015 Kirkup Report. In view of the continuing culture at the Trust, this cause a significant concern that issues of safety and safeguarding are not properly considered, transparently engaged with and then addressed formally in respect of a child fatality and serious injury by the Trust. 10. The Trust's clinical governance capability has been the subject of repeated and often severe criticism in the Flynn Review 2009, Fielding Report 2010, Central Manchester Hospital Report 2011, Price Waterhouse Cooper 2012 and Kirkup Report 2015. in his evidence to the inquest said that the Trust focus on process, which means that you can comply with the process requirements and still produce an inadequate investigation, rather than focussing on outcome, which measures the quality of the investigation and the patient experience. noted that the Trusts culture impeded transparent and open investigation. I am told that the Trust now uses the PSIRF model and is to appoint 3 whole time equivalent Response Leads by 30 September 2025. However, I remain concerned that the Trust has not fully engaged with the duty of candour such that I am not satisfied that the work on PSIRF to date has truly addressed the issues in respect of Trust's investigations. C: Mandatory Training, expired training and remedial training [Trust and ICB] 11. The Band 5 midwife supporting in Labour had not undertaken her required mandatory training and this fact had not been provided and was only revealed at the inquest as part of the evidence of the Head of Midwifery in March 2025. I was also concerned to learn that in 2025 non-completion of mandatory training was still an issue as had not completed her mandatory training. Coroner's Court, 2 Faraday Court, Faraday Drive, Fulwood, Preston, PR2 9NB Tel: (01772) 536536 12. It concerns me that the Trust do not have robust systems in place to ensure that any midwife who has not completed her mandatory training is subject to immediate action to ensure that all mandatory training is completed and is in date. 13. There was no remedial training was put in place for either the midwives involved in Ida's delivery and resuscitation or for the paediatric SHO after Ida's death. This raises a significant concern that the Trust do not operate a system of remedial training when this inquest has identified remedial training was required for , , and . D: Grading of harm for incident reporting: Babies who have sustained hypoxic brain injury and undergo cooling [Trust, ICB, DHSC, NHSE, ] 14. The Trust graded Ida's level of harm as “moderate”, even after her death. This grading should have been adjusted to ""severe"" by the Trust before Ida was transferred to Royal Preston Hospital as the consultant paediatrician identified that she had sustained a severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy due to fetal bradycardia. 15. The 2024 NHSE Learn from patient safety events (LFPSE) guidance that replaced the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) confirms that the recording and analysis of patient safety events that occur in healthcare support the NHS to improve learning from patient safety events to help make care safer. There is a significant risk that if reporting is graded on harm alone, clinical care that resulted in hypoxic brain damage during delivery and which was prevented by therapeutic cooling, will not adequately identify the problems that caused the harm during the delivery. 16. confirmed that nationally there is inconsistency in categorisation of harm for babies who sustain a hypoxic injury due to fetal bradycardia in labour and who require cooling and clarification guidance would assist prevent further Coroner's Court, 2 Faraday Court, Faraday Drive, Fulwood, Preston, PR2 9NB Tel: (01772) 536536 maternity deaths and ensure full and proper investigation of hypoxic injuries sustained in labour. E: Funding for MSNI [DHSC and , NHSE and ICB] 17. But for the HSIB investigation report into Ida's death admitted that Ida's death due to failures by the Trust would never have come to light or resulted in an inquest. 18. The MSNI is now hosted by the CQC with funding secured for the next two years but no certainty as to ongoing funding after this date. These independent investigations by specialist skilled investigators into the most serious of events is an essential safeguard to the lives of mothers and unborn children. 19. Without an assurance that funding will continue beyond 2027 I am concerned that significant harm events to mothers and babies and deaths such as Ida's will go unrecorded and lessons that should be learned to prevent future maternal and baby deaths will go unnoticed, and there will be a risk of future maternity deaths. 6",0,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion that 'Death was due to misadventure where Leanne had not been referred to the Perinatal Mental Health Service either during her pregnancy or at any point up to her death'.,"The circumstances of the death are as follows :- Leanne Marie Carroll was aged 27 at the time of her death on 29 June 2024. She had given birth to her first child approximately 8 months prior to her death. Leanne suffered from anxiety and, although not diagnosed, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). She sought assistance from her GP and she was referred in March 2024 to the Community Mental Health Team. She was referred to an OCD support group. It was noted that her OCD had deteriorated since giving birth. Leanne died from the excessive consumption of prescribed and non-prescribed medications. At no time had any health professional referred Leanne to the Perinatal Mental Health Service who could have supported her.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. Coroner's Office, County Hall, Wynnstay Road, Ruthin, LL15 1YN Tel 01824 708047 | In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows – 1. The Perinatal Mental Health Service was established across the Health Board around 5 years ago. It was accepted in evidence that there is insufficient awareness of the Service by health professionals including midwives, health visitors and GP's. Whilst attempts have been made to raise awareness and encourage direct referrals to the Service (rather than via the Single Point of Access) this remains inadequate. If health professionals are unaware of the Service then mothers-to-be and mothers who require assistance will not be fully supported. 2. There are only 2 temporary perinatal health visitors across the 3 Health Board areas and not one in the Eastern area of the Health Board. By not having permanent perinatal health visitors acros all three Health Board areas then those who need to access support will suffer 3. The Single Point of Access meetings which occur on a daily basis by way of triaging referrals do not provide written records of the discussions had and decisions made. This means that there is no written justiﬁcation for decisions made or written actions and therefore these discussions and decisions do not form part of any health record for the patient which would be relevant to the overall management of the patient. 4. I am concerned that deaths will occur into the future as awareness of the Service is not at all adequate to health professionals, the Service is not adequately staffed and records of meetings and decisions made in the Single Point of Access are not documented. 6",27,N/A: Not found

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) The deceased was assessed as a level 3 falls risk meaning she was to be kept under line of sight in case of falling. Witness statements served in advance of the inquest stated the fall was witnessed. It was however eventually accepted in evidence that the fall was in fact unwitnessed. The precise circumstances of the fall could not be determined. All of the investigations undertaken by the Trust relied upon the incorrect understanding that the fall was witnessed and observations were in line with Trust falls policy, when they were not. (2) The inquest heard that it is practice within the Trust that a Nursing Assistant is to be located centrally in the corridor on ward 9 to oversee patients assessed as at risk of falling and for the patients to be within staff's peripheral vision. The inquest heard that on 24 April 2024 8 patients were assessed as level 3 falls risk and 1 patient was assessed as level 4 falls risk. I am concerned as to the number of patients at risk of falls being observed in this way. I am further concerned that there is a misunderstanding of what is meant by peripheral vision and what constitutes a witnessed or unwitnessed fall. (3) I am concerned there is not greater scrutiny of witness accounts as part of the Trust's investigation process in particular given the concerns raised by the deceased's family early in the investigation and the other witness accounts to provide earlier learning to prevent future events. 6 7 8",68,N/A: Not found

Chief Executive Officer of Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, , Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, The Lodge, Lodge Approach, Runwell, Wickford, SS11 7XX 1","On 31 st October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of DARREN NEIL TURNER, aged 37 years. The investigation concluded at the end of a 9- day article 2 non-jury inquest on the 28 th February 2025. Darren Neil Turner was found deceased on 20 th October 2023 in a wooded area in Essex. The evidence disclosed that the deceased likely took his own life on the morning of the 18 th October 2023. The medical cause of death was confirmed as '1a Hanging'. In a narrative conclusion I recorded that the deceased took his own life in the context of multiple failures in the care, management and treatment provided to him by the Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) and that those serious failings amounted to neglect.","On the 23 rd September 2023 after concerns were raised that Darren, at his home address, was threatening to take his own life having consumed a potential overdose of medication whilst intoxicated with alcohol, the East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST) and Essex Police attended and attempted to facilitate a medical assessment of Darren. He would not consent to such an assessment and EEAST staff, deeming him to have mental capacity, and Essex Police, left him at the property. The following day, whilst apparently experiencing a serious mental health crisis, Darren caused extensive damage, and set fire, to the home he had shared with his former long-term partner, in what was an attempt to end his life. He was arrested and detained under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 1983 and, following an assessment, was subsequently detained under Section 2 of the MHA and admitted as an in- patient to Gosfield Ward, an Acute Psychiatric Unit at the Lakes Mental Health Unit, Colchester, Essex under the care of EPUT on 26 th September. Although Darren had no significant previous recorded history of mental health problems, he did have a history of alcohol misuse which had worsened over the two to three years preceding his death whilst working from home as a consequence of the Covid pandemic. A trigger for events in September 2023 appears to have been the ending of his long-term relationship, itself a consequence of Darren's drinking. The evidence disclosed multiple significant failings in the care, management and treatment of the deceased up to and including the rescinding of his Section 2 MHA detention and subsequent discharge from Gosfield Ward at around 2 pm on the 17 th October 2023. These failings, individually and cumulatively, more than minimally contributed to his self-inflicted death by hanging within some 18 hours or so of the rescinding of the Section 2 detention and Darren's discharge. Taken together, the causative failures identified during the course of the inquest constituted gross failures and, accordingly, led to a finding that neglect contributed to Darren's avoidable death.",": A significant number of the serious causative failings identified in this case have previously informed PFDRs issued to EPUT. In June 2024 a 'Thematic Analysis' Review Document prepared by EPUT's 'Lessons Team' identified 'Triangulated Themes' from a review of nine PFDRs issued in the Essex Coronial jurisdiction between June 2021 and January 2024. The Review acknowledged six 'Triangulated Themes' in respect of which failures causative of deaths had been, and continued to be, identified, namely: Communication; Training & Supervision; Record Keeping; Discharge Planning; Care Planning; Risk Assessment. (Further PFDRs issued to EPUT in October 2024 and February 2025 raised similar, related concerns). During Darren's inquest continuing failings under precisely the themes identified emerged once more as having informed the serious causative features contributing to Darren's death. In my opinion, the actions taken by EPUT to date to address the acknowledged failings reflected under the themes referred to have been, and remain, inadequate and incomplete; Accordingly, during the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern and, in my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 3 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (a) Failures in Care Planning: specifically, a failure to appropriately up-date and document matters relating to Darren's Care Plan consistent with Trust policy. The last up-date to his Care Plan was 12 days prior to discharge. (b) Failures in Documentation: in a number of acknowledged respects the electronic records were inadequate - and inconsistent with EPUT policy - with evidence of the 'cutting and pasting' of entries including Darren's initial 72-hour care plan containing details of another patient entirely. (c) Failures in Risk Assessments: specifically, failures to appropriately up- date and document matters relating to Darren's risk assessment consistent with Trust policy. Relevant passive and active risk factors were not formally reflected in his documented risk assessments. Evidence from his Responsible Consultant Psychiatrist and the discharging Psychiatrist confirmed that, had they been aware of a disclosure made by Darren to his key worker/nurse prior to discharge, the Section 2 detention would not have been rescinded, he would not have been discharged on the 17th October and, accordingly, it is likely that he would not have taken his own life the following day. (d) Failure to allocate a Care Coordinator as required under the Care Programme Approach (CPA) and as mandated by EPUT policy. This failure (resulting from significant human error not detected by an insufficiently robust system and not therefore corrected prior to the death - and in respect of which no DATIX was ever raised) was a feature that contributed to the serious failure in discharge planning in this case. (e) Failures in Communication including a failure to appropriately liaise with the deceased's Family and, specifically, Darren's mother to establish the suitability and safety of a discharge to her address not least in the context of Darren's disclosure that discharge to his mother's home might “make him feel worse” at a point in time that he later acknowledged “would be overwhelming” for him. (f) Failures in Discharge Planning and Execution: specifically, in addition to the features above, a failure to actively reconsider the safety of the discharge on the afternoon of the 17th October in light of the disclosure from Darren's mother that she would not, as had been previously indicated, be able to either collect Darren from the Ward or be at her home when he was discharged. There was no evidence of how, in fact, Darren even left the Unit. It is likely that the chaotic and unsupported nature of Darren's discharge from Gosfield Ward, also in breach of Trust policy, more than minimally contributed to his death some 18 hours after discharge. 6",37,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 th March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative: Colin Colley was aged 87 when on 14th October 2023 he died at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. Colin suffered with a number of comorbidities including dementia and frailty, and he was anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation. Colin suffered an unwitnessed fall from bed on 11th October, when he was an inpatient at St. David's Hospital, Cardiff. He was known to wander from his bed in hospital, and had fallen previously, and he had been assessed as being at high risk of falls. His restlessness and cognitive decline indicated that his cot sides should have been left down. He had been assessed as requiring one-to-one supervision. At the time of Colin's final fall, he had been left unsupervised and bed rails were in place, in error. He sustained a fatal brain bleed, and was transferred to the University Hospital of Wales, where sadly his condition deteriorated until his death. 1a Intracranial haemorrhage 1b Unwitnessed fall with traumatic head injury 1c Vascular dementia, frailty of old age II Atrial fibrillation (treated)",Mr Colley was left unsupervised with cot sides up. He climbed out and fell sustaining a fatal head injury. He should not have been left unsupervised and his cot sides should not have been up. The Inquest focused upon:- a. Mr Colley's risk of falling; and b. The use of the Enhanced Supervision Document;.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) Evidence was taken from nurses at St David's that there remains a lack of confidence in both qualified nursing staff, healthcare assistants and healthcare support workers in the use of and implication of risk assessments around falls, and the use of and importance of enhanced supervision and the Enhanced Supervision Document. I am concerned that unless more training is provided and refreshed frequently, there is a risk of future deaths occurring, particularly given the cohort being nursed at that hospital and the turnover of staff. 6",87,N/A: Not found

A first presentation of asthma at the age of 16 years without any family history is unusual, and it was a busy night in the accident and emergency department. Billie was inappropriately discharged at approximately 3.30am without adequate repeat observations or senior clinical review, and so her asthma was not diagnosed or treated. If it had been, she probably would have survived.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. A PSII (patient safety incident investigation) was conducted and learning identified, but some areas of concern do remain. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. At inquest, I heard repeatedly that on the night Billie attended, the Royal Free emergency department was understaffed, and that it remains understaffed of doctors, nurses, and even a healthcare assistant who could take basic observations. Billie should have had observations every hour. If she had had these observations, the emergency registrar who discharged her would have recognised that she was not as well as he thought, and would have sought senior medical review. That senior medical review would have changed the course of her management and saved her life. Following the inquest touching the death of Daniel Klosi, I wrote to you on 16 August 2024 about a lack of observations in the emergency department of the Royal Free. Although the circumstances were different, there is a theme. 2. The registrar who saw Billie the night before her death prescribed an antibiotic, but he was not in the habit of giving the first dose in the department and he did not on this occasion. This meant that Billie's infection was not tackled as quickly as it could have been. This seems to indicate a training and potentially a guideline need. 3 3. At the time of Billie's presentation, the registrar was unaware of the possibility of adult onset asthma. This seems to indicate a training and potentially a guideline need. 4. I heard that Billie was safety netted when she was discharged. Her parents were told to bring her back if they had any concerns. I have heard this safety netting advice being described many, many times in different inquests. What worries me about it in this context is that Billie's parents had brought her to hospital because they were concerned. They were then reassured by hospital staff. It is therefore difficult to see how this particular advice could be a meaningful instruction. In reality, her parents' initial concern was well placed and they had responded to it appropriately by bringing Billie to hospital. When Billie began to deteriorate again, her parents' natural instinct had been blunted by their first visit to the hospital. 5. Whilst I doubt that it would have made a difference in this case, I understand that blood pressure is not yet an observation included in the national paediatric early warning score (PEWS). 6",16,N/A: Not found

The investigation has not yet concluded, and the inquest has not been heard.","On 29 June 2024, Alexander Eastwood participated in a kickboxing competition in Wigan. He wore safety equipment including a head guard, and gloves. The fight lasted 3 x 2 minute rounds. At the end of the contest, he appeared unwell and became unresponsive apparently suffering a seizure. Medical assistance at the match was summoned and paramedics were called. He was taken by ambulance to Wigan Royal Albert & Edward Infirmary where a CT scan showed he had a significant bleed on the brain. He was transferred to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital in a critical condition and underwent surgery to relieve intracranial pressure, but unfortunately further bleeds developed and despite maximal medical intervention he deteriorated and was declared deceased on 2 July 2024.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the current course of investigation, it is apparent that there is no guidance or regulation of contact sports involving children's participation. 2. This is important, because no base line or minimum standards of what safeguarding or necessary risk management is set out for those who plan or organise an 'official' or 'unofficial' match where physical force may be used between or against a child participant. 3. Under current circumstance, arrangements for each, and every contact sport contest involving a child, is left to the judgement of an organiser who may have recourse to principles provided by a sports association, if the match is to meet official status. If a match is unofficial or unsanctioned, there is no guideline of what minimum standards Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 must be met to provide safeguarding for a child participant. 4. This includes a. no minimum standard of what medical support may be required, b. maximum rounds or periods of rest c. welfare checks on participants being undertaken. d. no risk assessment and critical incident plan 5. In the current investigation, these concerns relate to the sport of Kick Boxing, but the identified issues appear to be of wider significance in terms of 'contact ' sports involving children. 6",15,N/A: Not found

The medical cause of death was: 1a Asphyxia 1b Combined Drug Toxicity and Neck Ligature and Submersion II Selective Serotonin Inhibitors Withdrawal The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide,"Rhiannon Auriol Mary Williams was age 24 at the time of her death. Rhiannon was an exceptionally bright, talented and creative person who excelled academically and who was loved and supported by her family. Rhiannon's mental health deteriorated at a time when she suddenly stopped taking SSRI medication and a result, she experienced withdrawal symptoms which caused anxiety. Rhiannon was also concerned that she may have autism spectrum disorder, and her counsellor documented that she was displaying traits of this disorder. For at least a year prior to her death and possibly longer Rhiannon experienced suicidal thoughts. From May 2023 Rhiannon's suicidal thoughts and distress worsened although the full extent of Rhiannon's thoughts and distress was kept hidden from her family. In the months before her death Rhiannon started researching websites relating to suicide and in the month of her death, Rhiannon undertook a Tik Tok search of 'drowning in the bath'. On 15 September 2023 Rhiannon accessed a website called [REDACTED]. This website describes itself as a community that discusses mental illness and suicide from the perspective of suicidal people, as well as the moral implications of the act itself and actively encourages people to commit suicide. It also encourages individuals to hide their thoughts and actions from their loved ones. There is no moderation of this website. Rhiannon used this website to download a detailed document entitled '[REDACTED] guide' which describes in detail how to use these medications to bring about death. There is evidence that Rhiannon used the internet to obtain [REDACTED]. There is also evidence that Rhiannon had written down and practised the method that she eventually used on the day of her death – information also likely obtained from the above website / social media. On 16 September 2023 Rhiannon was found [REDACTED]. Toxicology findings confirmed the presence of [REDACTED] at an elevated level which would have had a sedatory effect and likely impairment of Rhiannon's respiration.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows – Rhiannon accessed an online 'suicide forum' where she was able to access information on how to take her own life and where she obtained advice/information on misleading professionals and her family as to her thoughts and intentions. Rhiannon also accessed a social media platform to obtain information about the method Rhiannon used to take her own life. A similar concern was raised by Patricia Harding Senior Coroner for Central and South East Kent in a Prevent Future Death report of 2019 raising a similar concern in respect of 'suicide forums'. The response from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport of 14 January 2020 referred to The Online Harms White Paper. I am aware of The Online Safety Act 2023 and also BBC reporting -https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67082224 - touching upon whether this Act is in fact sufficient to deal with the risks posed by 'suicide websites'. I am concerned about the risk to life posed by the website and social media platform considered in this inquest and so draw them to your attention. 6",24,N/A: Not found

The conclusion of the Inquest was that Nicholas' death was due to natural causes, the medical cause of his death being 1a) Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest; 1b) Dilated Cardiomyopathy; 2) Chronic Substance Misuse (Cocaine, Heroin), Thrombosis of Pulmonary Vasculature, Pulmonary Granulomas (from injection of illicit drugs)","Nicholas had been arrested and detained in the custody Suite at Elland Road Police Station, Leeds, overnight on 13 th -14 th November 2022. On 14 th November he was remanded in custody pending being put before a court on 15 th November. During the afternoon of 14 th November, Nicholas was provided with a hot drink and a snack bar in his cell. AT 1507 hours he was observed by his in-cell CCTV (which was not regularly monitored) to pull his blanket over his head and shortly thereafter to become motionless. A Detention Officer looked through the observation panel in Nicholas' cell door at 1522 hours and observed him to be breathing. At 1544 hours, Nicholas was found to be unresponsive by another Detention Officer who had entered his cell as part of a final check before handing over to the late shift. Another Detention Officer and a Healthcare Professional (a nurse) attended the cell. Nicholas was moved from the cell bench to the floor, and the nurse inserted an intraosseous needle at 1548 hours and an oxygen mask shortly thereafter. The nurse continued to attempt to rouse Nicholas and applied defibrillator pads to him at 1551 hours. CPR was commenced at 1552 hours. Ambulance staff arrived at 1556 hours and Nicholas was taken from the cell to hospital at 1626 hours. He was pronounced deceased in the Ressus area of the Emergency Department at Leeds General Infirmary at 1656 hours. His heart had remained in asystole or pulseless electrical activity from the point of his being discovered unresponsive in his cell.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-

(1) From the point when the Detention Officer first entered Nicholas' cell to when CPR was commenced, 8 minutes and 12 seconds elapsed without CPR being given. Within that timeframe, two Detention Officers and a nurse were present in the cell after 75 seconds had passed.

(2) On the evidence, there did not appear to be any shared understanding between the three people in the cell with Nicholas of the urgency of starting CPR on an unresponsive person. There did not appear to be a co-ordinated approach to assisting Nicholas, with the Detention Officers and the nurse not appearing to have defined roles which they understood and undertook.

(3) It was not clear whether there were any protocols in place to define the respective roles of detention staff and medical staff attending a medical emergency in a cell. The passage of time before CPR was commenced gives rise to a concern either that the importance of early CPR was not appreciated, or that the communication between detention and medical staff did not facilitate its prompt commencement.",27,N/A: Not found

The Investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 5 th March 2025. I gave a narrative conclusion 'Natural causes contributed to by the physiological strain of necessary surgical procedure to a fractured neck of femur following an unwitnessed fall in hospital.' The medical cause of death was: – Ia Myocardial Infarction Ib Hypertension Ic Chronic Kidney Disease II Frailty of Old Age, Fractured Neck of Femur (Operated)","Allan was admitted on 28th May 2024 to Sunderland Royal Hospital following an unwitnessed fall at home with a long lie. Upon admission to hospital Allan was assessed as requiring Level 1 EICO observations, and this was upgraded to Level 2 at 19:14hrs on 29th May 2024 due to concerns around Allan's confusion. Allan had been placed in a Side Room 1 due to concerns regarding possible clostridium difficile infection, which was later confirmed positive after tests. Allan had been assessed by a physiotherapist on 29 th May 2024 that he needed minimal assistance to mobilise with the assistance of one person and a wheeled Zimmer frame. Allan had an unwitnessed fall on 29th May 2024 at 23:20hrs, with the evidence suggesting that he had moved to the end of his bed to negotiate the bed rails and then walked unaided for approximately 5 metres before falling, resulting in a fractured right neck of femur, which required necessary surgical intervention, as immobility posed a significant risk to him. Noise from his room had alerted a nurse who found him on the floor between the bed and the en-suite bathroom. On 30 th May 2024 Allan was moved to an orthopaedic ward in preparation for surgery. Following an uneventful induction of anaesthesia on 1 st June 2024, Allan became hypotensive on the operating table and went into a cardiac arrest. Allan passed away whilst in theatre due to the physiological strain of the surgery.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: – 1. The evidence confirmed that the guidelines for Level 2 EICO observations, which required a nurse to be within sight or sound of Allan, were not complied with as Allan was in a Side Room 1, which was not within sight or sound of the nursing station. It has been explained that the geography of that ward is such that this is the furthest side room away from the nursing station, and a vestibule is before it. 2. The evidence was that this was not escalated to the Matron or Site Manager, which may have resulted in the movement of an additional member of staff to ensure compliance with the EICO Level 2 observations. 3. The evidence was that had Allan been within sight or sound for observations, it was likely that upon Allan attempting to get out of bed, assistance could have been provided to him, which in turn may have prevented the fall.

His exact diagnosis was a matter of differing opinion between clinicians but alternative diagnoses included paranoid schizophrenia, drug induced psychosis and personality disorder for which he was prescribed antipsychotic and anti-anxiety medication. In 2019 he was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and in 2021 he was transferred to HMP Rochester. Between September 2022 and August 2023 he had been placed on ACCT procedures on five previous occasions whilst at HMP Rochester after concerns of self-harm were raised including after making ligatures. The inquest investigated the last few months of his life when he finished psychological therapy and was removed from the mental health team's caseload. Coincident with this but not apparently because of it he started to self isolate and was managed under CSIP procedures. In December 2023 he stopped taking his medication. His mental health deteriorated. In early January 2024 an ACCT was opened when the deceased was discovered with a ligature [REDACTED]. The ACCT remained open for the whole of January, with six reviews being held. The mental health team did not attend any of the reviews, although they provided a verbal contribution for one which did not contain relevant information from which an accurate risk assessment could be made. The ACCT was closed without the support actions being completed (which included the prisoner engaging with the mental health team) and without consideration of the available documentation. The Custodial Manager and supervising officer on the wing who were responsible for closing the ACCT had been sent emails echoing that which was in the ongoing record that the deceased was hallucinating and was talking of hanging himself which they had not read. There were multiple failures follow policies for both the prison and mental health staff.

Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing & Chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council 4. Chief Executive Officer of NHS Dorset 1,"On 16 th December 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Marta Elena Vento, born on the 26 th March 1993 who was aged 27 years at the time of her death. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 28 th February 2025. The medical cause of death was: Ia Multiple blunt force head injuries The conclusion of the Inquest was the following narrative conclusion: “Marta Elena Vento was unlawfully killed by another who at the time of her death was unmedicated for a diagnosed mental health illness because of a failure to sufficiently plan and ensure the continuity of his mental health care upon his release from prison 6 weeks prior to Marta's death, and because he was not adequately managed as a sex offender in line with national guidance upon his release from prison.”","On the 9th December 2020, Marta was working alone as a receptionist at the Travelodge Hotel, 43 Christchurch Road, Bournemouth, when at 05.12 hours she was relentlessly beaten in the most violent manner by another in a sudden and unprovoked attack in the bar/café area at the hotel. At the time of Marta's death, the perpetrator was actively psychotic due to being unmedicated for psychosis. The perpetrator of Marta's death was released from prison on the 27th October 2020, 6 weeks prior to her death. His release was unexpected at that time to those working in the prison and prison healthcare. Whilst in prison he was diagnosed with psychosis and when unmediated was unpredictable and violent. He was treated with medication for this mental health illness which resolved the psychotic symptoms and violence. Upon his release from prison a discharge summary was not sent to his GP, nor was there a referral to the mental health team to continue care. At this time there was no integrated mental health policy in place within the healthcare department at the prison, there was a lack of comprehensive care planning infrastructure across prison healthcare nationally and the prison healthcare team were experiencing pressures arising from reduced staffing following the mobilisation of the healthcare contract at the prison and the impact of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. The perpetrator was issued with medication for his mental health illness upon release from prison, however, as there was no continuity of the mental health care and treatment following his release, the perpetrator's medication ran out on the 24th November 2020 leading to a relapse of his psychosis. Upon his release from prison the perpetrator was managed as a sex offender in the community. There was incomplete information gathering to identify, assess and manage his risks in the community and no ARMS risk assessment was completed or management plan put into place in respect of the perpetrator prior to Marta's death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The perpetrator of Marta's death was a remand prisoner at HMP Winchester between the 9th of July and the 27th of October 2020. He was released on the 27th October 2020 unexpectedly after a video link hearing before the Magistrates Court at which he was sentenced and immediately released. During the period of his remand, the perpetrator was diagnosed with serious mental health illness for which he received medication. This treated his psychotic symptoms, one of which was that he undertook violent acts when unmedicated. During the period of remand he assaulted 4 individuals, including two prison officers, whilst unmedicated. The evidence revealed that this behaviour would increase a persons risk of harm to the public. There is no evidence that these incidents were known to the sentencing Court on the 27th of October 2020. Evidence was given by the Head of the Offender Management Unit (OMU) at HMP Winchester, a Senior Probation Officer, that there is currently no formal process or guidance in place for the sharing of information by a prison with the Criminal Courts to provide an update of the person's behaviour in prison which may increase their risk of harm or risk offending. It was explained that the person who could enquire about this at Court, if asked, would be the duty Probation Officer, and that this is especially more challenging to complete when a fast delivery report is requested. There is currently no process from a prison perspective to share information to the sentencing Court other than that contained within the Prison Escort Record (PER), which is not provided to the sentencing Judge, the lawyers at Court or Probation staff. I am concerned that the full extent of a remanded prisoner's risk of harm to the public may not be appreciated by the sentencing Judge, which could impact upon the sentence imposed upon a prisoner and I am concerned that this lack of sharing of information could lead to future deaths. (2) When the perpetrator was released from HMP Winchester, there was a lack of continuity of care provided to him in relation to his severe mental health illness. A considerable amount of work has been undertaken by Practice Plus Group (PPG) since Marta's death to ensure continuity of care to prisoners upon release in the prisons where PPG provide health care, such as ensuring the care is discharged to the prisoner's GP and, if required, a referral to the relevant health care providers completed. There are, however, other healthcare providers in prisons in England and Wales. There is a lack of national guidance to assist all healthcare providers to ensure continuity of care for a prisoner with health care needs, whether physical or mental health needs, upon release from prison. There are national standards of care and NICE guidelines in place, however none of these provide practical guidance around the delivery of care to ensure continuity of care. The perpetrator of Marta's death was released homeless on the 27th October 2020 which led to an additional complication around the referral of his care to a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). Processes are in place between HMP Winchester and Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust, who provide the mental health care in Dorset, to ensure that when a person is released homeless a referral for that person's continued mental health care will be accepted by DHUFT if that person's GP is registered in Dorse. Evidence was given that this is not the process nationally in that some mental healthcare trusts will not accept a referral if a person is homeless. There is no national guidance about the continuity of care for prisoners upon release from prison when homeless. I am concerned that this lack of continuity of care could lead to future deaths. (3) Evidence was given extensively throughout the Inquest about the management of sexual and violent offender (MOSOVO) unit within Dorset Police. Each police force in England and Wales has a MOSOVO unit with a team of staff managing sexual and violent offenders. Evidence was given that predominantly this is for the management of sexual offenders. There is Approved Professional Practice (APP) guidance issued by the College of Policing regarding the operation of MOSOVO units. This guidance details the risk assessments to be undertaken which are a crucial stage in the management of these offenders. The risk assessments detailed in the guidance are aimed at the assessment of the sexual risk of offenders and evidence was given that there is no bespoke risk assessment tool or guidance to assess the violence of such offenders to assist staff within MOSOVO units to undertake their role. There is, therefore, a lack of guidance on how to risk assess and manage offenders who are managed under MOSOVO when they present with the risk of violence, or an escalating risk of violence. I am concerned that this will result in a failure to identify the risk of violence, or the increasing risk of violence, in those being managed by MOSOVO which may lead to a further death. (4) The National Record Locator (NRL) allows health or social care workers to find and access patient information shared by other health and social care organisations across England to support the direct care of a patient. Evidence was given by the Head of Clinical Development and Organisational Development at South West Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWAST) that in the South West region all Integrated Care Boards (ICBs), apart from the ICB in Dorset, NHS Dorset, are at some stage of implementing the use of NRL so that SWAST can access this information to assist in the provision of care to those they treat. Evidence was given that as this would limit the information SWAST had access to about a patient in Dorset, this would impact upon the care provided to those in Dorset by SWAST which could lead to a future death. “6",27,N/A: Not found

The inquest was resumed and concluded on 16 December 2024 with further submissions in respect of Regulation 28 matters received on 29 January 2025 and 5 March 2025.

The medical cause of Mr Barnes' death was:

1a. [REDACTED] toxicity

With respect to where, when and how Mr Barnes came by his death it was recorded at Box 3 of the Record of Inquest as follows:

Luke Harry Brockwell BARNES was found dead at his home in Cobham on 9 February 2024. He had taken sufficient [REDACTED] to result in his death from [REDACTED] toxicity. His death was formally recorded by paramedics at 1134 hours that same day.

The inquest concluded with a short form conclusion of 'Drug related'.","During the course of the inquest the court heard that Mr Barnes had a diagnosis of autism and a personality disorder with a history of previous convictions. He had long-term drug abuse issues including purchasing drugs online. At the time of his death Mr Barnes was subject to probation service supervision following a short period on licence and a 12 month community order made by Guildford Crown Court, this included a Drug Rehabilitation Requirement (DRR). The DRR was not implemented by the probation service. Mr Barnes was referred to a similar programme, which he attended, but which could not require him to undergo regular drug testing. The coroner heard that any such alteration to sentence requires the court itself to review the original sentence. That did not happen in Mr Barnes' case. Following his arrest in April 2023 Mr Barnes had been referred by Westminster Court Probation Service to the Liaison and Diversion Service at Westminster Magistrates Court for assessment and review. A report was prepared by a specialist practitioner for intellectual disabilities and learning disabilities. That report included insights into his character and behaviour, discussion about his autism and recommendations as to how best to manage Mr Barnes in the future. In June 2023 post sentence probation supervision for Mr Barnes was passed from London to Staines. The court heard that the report prepared by the Liaison and Diversion Service specialist practitioner was not seen by or was not available to probation staff in Staines.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: a.Probation staff are not always aware of or have access to relevant and/or specialist medical reports prepared for Liaison and Diversion Service and other bodies including mental health providers. Further evidence obtained from HMPPS indicates that reports prepared for Liaison and Diversion Service or mental health service providers by specialist medical practitioners (including learning disability practitioners) may not always be notified to the probation service and that the sharing of such information relies to an extent on ad hoc arrangements. The coroner has been told that this issue has been identified previously in a Serious Further Offences Review. b.Whether there is sufficient training for all frontline probation service staff about neurodiverse conditions and their impact on post sentence supervision. The Court heard from Mr Barnes' probation practitioner, they had limited awareness of neurodiversity issues as they might affect the supervision of Mr Barnes or probation service policy in this area. Although further evidence from HMPPS confirms that since 2021 all trainee probation officers are required to attend a face-to-face training session on neurodiversity and probation officers and qualified probation officers have training available to them it is not clear if this training is sufficient and for all frontline probation staff. c. That a loophole exists whereby a sentence of the court, not actioned by probation service staff, (in this case a DRR) might not be referred back to the court for review. 7",29,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5th March 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Jean Pike was a vulnerable women aged 54 at the time of death and had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and suffered from a depressive illness. Jean resided in supported accommodation and was under secondary mental health care. In the three months prior to her death Jean's mental health deteriorated and she engaged in serious self-harm to manage her suicidal thoughts. At this time all those involved with Jean knew she was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was expressing an intention to hang herself and was impulsive. Jean had two hospital admissions in the three weeks before her death and during this time support staff at Jean's accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator were clearly communicating to the acute hospital where Jean was admitted on both occasions that they could not keep Jean safe in the community in her supported accommodation and that they were concerned that Jean was going to hang herself. Seven days before Jean's death a decision was taken by a consultant psychiatrist to discharge Jean from hospital nine hours after she had been admitted and at time when Jean was still actively experiencing suicidal thoughts. This decision was taken without any consultation with the professionals involved with Jean and there was no risk assessment of Jean's risk of suicide undertaken by the consultant before Jean was discharged. I find that these actions including the decision to discharge Jean from hospital constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. On the day of her death Jean experienced a 2 mental health crisis at her supported accommodation and was threatening to hang herself. This was known to support staff at Jean's supported accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator but despite this an inadequate safety plan was put in place to safeguard Jean. Jean was left unattended for between 20 – 45 minutes during which time Jean took her own life by hanging. I find that the failure to put in place a robust safety plan and leaving Jean unattended constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. I find that Jean took her own life and that she intended to do so, and that Jean's death was contributed to by neglect. 4",On 18 May 2022 Jean Pike was stating that she was suicidal and intending to hang herself. Jean Pike was left unattended and unobserved for between 20 – 45 minutes. Jean Pike was then found suspended in her supported living accommodation on 18 May 2022 and declared deceased at 14.27.,"During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. I am concerned that Jean was discharged from Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital on two occasions shortly before her death by a consultant psychiatrist and that prior to the decision to discharge on both occasions there was no multi-disciplinary meeting between the consultant on Ward F and the professionals directly involved in caring for Jean in the community about Jean's mental health and the risks she posed to herself in the community. This was in circumstances where the consultant knew before the decisions to discharge that these professionals, which included Jean's care co- ordinator, were clearly stating that they were extremely concerned about Jean's mental health and that they did not consider that they could keep Jean safe in the community and that they thought that Jean would hang herself in the community – which is in fact what happened in this case. I am particularly concerned by the evidence I heard from Jean's care co-ordinator that care co-ordinators are rarely if ever consulted by consultant psychiatrists in Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital before a decision is made to discharge a patient/person under secondary mental health care. This issue was not identified by Swansea University Bay Health Board ('SUBHB') in their internal investigation into Jean's death. This investigation found that “there is evidence of regular and effective communication between support staff, community staff and hospital staff”. The above finding of SUBHB's internal investigation raises a concern that critical lessons have not being identified and learnt by SUBHB from Jean's death about the importance of multi-disciplinary decision making in clinical care and risk management and the importance of including care co-ordinators and professionals in the community before a decision is taken to discharge a patient from Ward F. This creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. I am also concerned that if there is a lack of clarity or a reluctance in Ward F at the consultant level to engage with care co-ordinators and professionals in the community (and before decisions are made to discharge) there is a risk that the concerns of the professionals managing a patient/person under secondary care will not be adequately considered in the decisions made by Ward F 3 clinicians. This also creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. 6",54,N/A: Not found

The conclusion of the inquest was that: Upon the 10th February 2024, at her home address, Andrea Denise Mann was discovered by a member of her family, to be hanging from a noose placed around her neck [REDACTED]. Mrs Mann was released from her position, and transported by the Ambulance Service to Bradford Royal Infirmary where she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Despite receiving advanced life support the medical condition of Mrs Mann did not improve.

(brief summary of matters of concern)

The findings made by myself at the Inquest include the following;
1) That during the period of her involvement with the Community Mental Health Trust between the period 25/04/2023 and 04/12/2023 the care given to the deceased was limited to 2 appointments only within which she was referred back to her GP for medication adjustment which had been seen to be ineffective, and referral to Psychological therapy sessions which had a waiting period of 6 months despite an earlier private consultation having been proved ineffective,
That the frequent requests of the deceased and her family for a Psychiatric appointment had not been provided to her, with the result that the deceased had to seek a private consultation.
2) That no evidence of any overarching management tool existed to provide scrutiny of the care given to the deceased, or measure the success or efficacy of such care, and as such there were many lost opportunities to provide to the deceased and her family sufficient, consistent, controlled and bespoke care.",61,N/A: Not found

The medical cause of death was established as: 1a Peritonitis and Upper Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage 1b Perforated Pyloric Ulcer I reached a narrative conclusion: Annette Lewis, aged 73, re-presented at hospital on 15th. April 2023, for the second time that week, with worsening abdominal pain. Annette was discharged from hospital in the early hours of 16th. April, without full consideration of her symptoms and test results. Annette was declared deceased at her home [REDACTED] on 18th. April 2023. On the balance of probabilities, Annette would have survived if she had been referred for a surgical review and treatment rather than being discharged.",These were recorded as: Annette Lewis attended the Emergency Department on 9 th . April 2023 with abdominal pain and was discharged with antibiotics and painkillers. She re-attended the Emergency Department with worsening abdominal pain on 15 th . April 2023 and was discharged on 16 th . April with further medication and an outpatient referral for gastroenterology. The decision to discharge was made without sufficient weight being given to an internal Health Board document for investigating “Abdominal Pain in the Elderly” and Annette's blood tests results had not been reviewed.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Annette should have been referred for surgical review rather than being discharged. Work on a “Failed Discharge” policy has been ongoing for some time. When implemented, patients re-attending Emergency Departments in similar circumstances would be automatically and swiftly filtered to the appropriate specialist team, which would reduce the risks for those individual patients and reduce pressures and the consequent risk of errors within Emergency Departments. Progress with this policy has been difficult and there is no definitive timescale for implementation. 6",73,N/A: Not found

Chair of the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 2. , Chief Executive at Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 3. , Estates and facilities management consultant/director at Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 1.",On 13 th August 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Henok Zaid GEBRSSLASIE (aged 23 years). The investigation concluded at the end the inquest on 5 th March 2025 at Coventry Coroners Court. The conclusion of the death of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was that death was “suicide and a narrative” a copy of which I attach to this report.,"Mr GEBRSSLASIE on the 2nd August 2021 was arrested by the police having been removed from a bus in possession of a plank of wood and oddly offering the police money sufficient for bus fare, this and his behaviour , throwing a road sign at officers precipitated his detention in police custody which gave rise to a mental health act assessment and his detention at the Caludon Centre. Part of his medical treatment included antipsychotic medication and sedation following an episode of violence. On 5th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE absconded from the Caludon Centre via a window, however he was located at his home address and returned to the Caludon Centre the next day and remained detained (under the Menal Health Act) on the Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, his behaviour leading staff to provide him with rip-proof clothing. There was an issue with language, involved communications achieved with an interpreter. Over the following days, in the context of medications provided, his mood was now adjudged seemingly more stable and by the 12th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE was allowed his own clothing, rip proof clothing removed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was provide some hospital type pyjamas whist his personal clothing was being washed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was on level 2 observations (every 15 minutes) and having expression a wish to go home it was communicated to him that his discharge from hospital was an ongoing process and not imminent. On 12th August 2021, the body of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was discovered in his bedroom (Bedroom 2) on Sherbourne Ward nearly 3 hours after his last observation. The deceased had a ligature ([REDACTED]) around his neck and was partially suspended from the bedroom door. The Oxevision system camera (part of a research project, to assess whether new non-contact monitoring technology improves quality of care and safety for patients and staff) in the patients' rooms captured the last interactions Mr GEBRSSLASIE has with staff, where upon moments after the bedroom door closed Mr GEBRSSLASIE then proceeded to use the same bedroom door as an anchor point for the ligature.","During the inquest, the evidence and information revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report them to you. The MATTER(S) OF CONCERN are as follows: i. The inquest explored issues such ligature anchor points. ii. It is known (and has been known for some years by the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust) that the top of a door is a “high risk area” for ligatures in particular patients bedroom which have doors that may be locked by patients from the inside and thereby an unobserved patient area. iii. The circumstances of this inquest touching upon the death of Henok GEBRSSLASIE in August 2021 accentuated this point. iv. Such risks carrying with it a clear risk of death. v. Since the incident it was known that door top alarms is “the way forward” as an environmental change that would mitigate such risk and referred to in a serious investigation report in April 2023, this “way forward” expressed in evidence during the inquest. vi. There remains (now 42 months post Mr GEBRSSLASIEs death) no door top alarms on the patient bedroom doors at Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, at the Caludon Centre. vii. The cumulative effect (there 'seemingly' no expediency to physically better mitigate this known environmental high-risk issue) is such that a concern as to future deaths exists as of March 2025. 6.",23,N/A: Not found

He was physically frail and lived with Alzheimer's Dementia Antibiotics for a chest infection were prescribed by Ray's out of hours GP on 16.02.23. The care home made initial attempts to obtain the antibiotics from a pharmacy that evening but failed to achieve this. They did not seek further medical advice or admission to hospital that night. Further unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain the antibiotics the next day. No attempts were made to obtain antibiotics on 18.02.23 nor was further medical advice or admission to hospital sought. By 19.02.23 Ray's condition had deteriorated to the extent that he required hospital admission. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Despite appropriate treatment in hospital, Ray did not recover and he died on 07.03.23. The medical evidence was clear that, although it could not be said that prompt admission of antibiotics would have probably prevented the need for Ray to be admitted to hospital and/or his death, the failure to either promptly administer the antibiotics or seek further medical care for him was a significant failing on the part of the care home. This was admitted in evidence and was identified as a missed opportunity. Evidence was given by the care home that lessons had been learned and systems improved but no documents were adduced in support of this such that the court could be confident that this issue would not reoccur.

He had sustained fractures to his fibula, five ribs on the right side of his chest and his larynx. These fractures contributed more than minimally to his death, by reducing his mobility and adding to his difficulty in breathing normally, thus likely exacerbating his underlying pneumonia. On 28th June 2022 the Deceased had been in contact with officers from Merseyside Police, when he was detained for the purposes of a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Some of the officers used force in the course of his detention, which probably caused the fractures to the fibula, ribs and larynx. The force used was not reasonable and proportionate. The officers offered the Deceased the opportunity for medical assessment but he declined it. The Deceased was returned to his home address later the same day and remained there until his death. In the intervening period he complained to his family of being in pain, for which he self-medicated, but he declined suggestions that he should seek medical advice. Officers suspected that the Deceased had swallowed something previously concealed in his mouth at the time of detention but didn't pick up or fully convey to other officers on the urgency of a potentially life threatening condition. At post mortem a package containing drugs was found inside the Deceased's colon. It is unlikely that this package was the reason for the drugs found in the sample of blood analysed as part of the post mortem toxicology. There was reasonable suspicion that the Deceased ingested drugs, however this information was not relayed to all officers in attendance despite there being life-threatening consequences. Furthermore, upon handover to the Deceased's family, the potential drug ingestion was not communicated to them, which did not allow the family to facilitate appropriate medical care.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The Deceased was observed by officers conducting what they suspected to be a drug deal. Within minutes, he was detained in the street for the purposes of a search under S.23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. At this time, he was seen/suspected by officers to have swallowed something, which they believed might be drugs. He denied it. Nothing was found on an external search other than Methadone, which had been prescribed to his partner. He could have been arrested for this, but was not. The Deceased sustained a significant injury to his leg at the scene (which was found on the post- mortem examination to be a fractured fibula), due to a blow from a police baton. He was asked if he wanted medical attention, but said not. He was taken to a nearby police station for a strip search. Again, nothing was found. Officers then took the Deceased back to his home address and left him there, with members of his family in attendance. Little more than an hour elapsed between the officers' first and last contact with the Deceased that day. Post mortem examination found a package containing drugs in the Deceased's colon, but it could not be established whether this had been swallowed (at the time of the detention or otherwise) or inserted per rectum at some time. The court heard that College of Policing Guidance for Custody Officers and Detention Officers provides that “…If officers know or suspect that a detainee has swallowed or packed drugs…they must treat the person as being in need of urgent medical attention and transfer then straight to hospital”. However: (a) a person detained for a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act does not come to the attention of a Custody or Detention Officer, unless arrested; (b) there is no guidance (known to the court) to assist officers involved in such a search as to what they should do; (c) there is seemingly no power for officers to convey to hospital somebody detained under these provisions (but not arrested), if that is against their wishes. The upshot seems to be that, whilst the risk arising from swallowing a package containing drugs is the same in each case, there is a material difference between how different types of detainee are managed, depending upon whether an arrest has taken place. Officers told the court that if somebody declines an offer of medical attention they simply monitor their condition, for signs of any change or deterioration. However, even if that is effective and adequate, any monitoring inevitably ends when the individual is released from detention. In this case that was little more than an hour after the suspected swallowing event. When he was returned home, officers gave no advice to the Deceased or his family about the need for continued monitoring. There appears to be no guidance directed towards them as to what advice should be given. One officer said that nothing could be said to the family (about the need to keep him under close watch, because of the risk), because that would breach the individual's right to privacy. It occurs to me that a person suspected of involvement in a drugs deal (even if nothing is found on a search) might well be keen to avoid further attention from the police and/or medical services as quickly as possible, for fear of something being found that might incriminate them. I am concerned that a person detained for the purposes of a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act, who is then suspected of having swallowed drugs, might be exposed to a risk of death (or other significant harm) if they do not receive the sort of medical attention which the guidance to Custody and Detention Officers considers an 'urgent' requirement, and/or if they are not given appropriate guidance on their release from detention. I am further Official Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 concerned that officers are not given guidance or training in how to address this risk, by means of communication or otherwise. 6",59,N/A: Not found

The conclusion of the inquest was that the effect of medication in combination contributed to Chloe's death.,"Chloe Elizabeth Burgess was found deceased at home at [REDACTED], Southampton, Hampshire on 8th September 2023. Chloe was prescribed heart medication after a diagnosis of sinus tachycardia and left bundle branch block as well as antidepressant medication. It is likely that the medication interacted with each other to raise the levels of amitriptyline in Chloe's blood which, combined with her heart medication and an episode of sleep apnoea, induced severe cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. She had been using the combination of drugs for four years before she died without concern. The potential dangers of the combination of drugs in Chloe's case was not well-known or appreciated by those treating her.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The inquest heard evidence that the potential dangers of the combination of amitriptyline, paroxetine and ivabradine is not widely appreciated and does not trigger an alert on the prescribing software used in primary care or by pharmacists. The potential dangers related to a failure to metabolise amitriptyline which can, incrementally, lead to toxicity. I am also concerned that those prescribing ivabradine should have a full understanding of the potential interaction with amitriptyline and paroxetine. 6",27,N/A: Not found

Mr Lawless's mental health had deteriorated in the aftermath of an incident on 18th May 2024 which led to him being found outdoors in Manchester City Centre partially clothed and with a head injury, but with no specific recollection as to what had occurred. Amphetamine was subsequently detected as being present in Mr Lawless's system around this time, which he maintained he had not ingested voluntarily. Police officers attended in response to a 999 call made by a member of the public, and an investigation commenced in respect of the crime of battery / common assault pursuant to s39 Criminal Justice Act 1988. This investigation was later closed following difficulties in establishing contact with Mr Lawless. Mr Lawless had used cocaine prior to his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

A conclusion of natural causes was returned.,"Mr Fernandez was born with cerebral palsy and complex medical needs. He had been in the care of Oldham Social Services since he was a child. He was not able to speak and registered blind. Since 2008 he had been residing at a supported living home with full time carers. His care package was provided by Comfort Call. His carers had a wealth of knowledge and understanding as to how Mark communicated, what he liked and disliked, his feeding regime and all aspects of his care and health needs. They also facilitated weekly visits with a close family member who received similar care. During the day on the 1 st February Mr Fernandez had attended the specialist sarcoma service at Manchester Foundation Trust (“MFT”) following a referral from Rochdale Infirmary. Limited information had been provided as to his level of disability and as such the court heard that a very limited examination was conducted whilst he remained clothed and in his chair. If MFT had been aware they indicated they would have had the opportunity to obtain a hoist and would have requested bloods before attendance. They indicated they had now changed their practices. On the 1 st February 2025 Mr Fernandez was admitted to Royal Oldham hospital at 8pm in the evening with suspected meningitis (a rash had become evident). His carers forwarded his hospital passport and also sent further copies to the hospital following his admission to a ward. Investigations highlighted he had recurring infections and despite treatment, including the insertion of a PEG, he remained in hospital until his death on the 18 th April 2024. On the 12 th April 2024 following a best interests meeting he was placed on end of life care. The carers and social services involvement in Mark's life was overlooked and their views and knowledge of Mark was not taken into account in the best interest decision-making process.

The Investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 25 th February 2025. The narrative conclusion of the Inquest was 'Deterioration of a heart condition whilst an ambulance allocation was significantly delayed following a missed opportunity to assign an earlier available ambulance'. The medical cause of death was: – Ia Heart Failure II Aortic Dissection","Jack Matthew Shields was a 29 year old male with a past medical history outlining extensive heart conditions. Jack had three previous open-heart surgeries including aortic dissection. On the evening of 27 th April 2024 Jack experienced shortness of breath, and his mother called 999 at 23:14hrs that night. This was categorised as Cat 2. Following a clinician callback at 00:27am on 28 th April 2024 an ambulance was allocated at 00:31am and arrived on scene at 00:36am. This was over an hour later than the national average response time for Cat 2 patients. It later transpired after an investigation by NEAS following Jack's death, that another ambulance had been available at 23:24am and, if allocated, would have arrived on scene at 23:36hrs on 27 th April 2024. At 00:52 on 28 th April 2024 an amber backup request was made, and a rapid response paramedic arrived at 01:07am. A third crew arrived at 01:36am, but Jack had already deteriorated into a cardiac arrest. The backup request was incorrectly categorised by the crew as Jack's condition was clearly deteriorating, and he was acutely unwell due to reducing blood pressure over a short time, tachycardia and an ECG revealed an ST- Elevated Myocardial Infarction. He required a higher priority backup. Jack died at his home address of [REDACTED], Sunderland despite extensive resuscitation attempts with his death declared at 02:27am on 28 th April 2024.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is: – At 00:36am on 28th April 2024 the first ambulance arrived at the scene, which was 1 hour and 22 minutes following the initial call being received. This was a technician led dual crew ambulance provided by NERAMS - a third-party provider. The crew informed the Emergency Operations Centre at 00:52am on 28th April 2024 that an amber request for paramedic assistance was required. A rapid response paramedic arrived at the scene at 01:07am on 28th April 2024. Unfortunately, Jack deteriorated into a cardiac arrest and despite resuscitative efforts, he was declared deceased at 02:27am on 28th April 2024. The evidence was clear that Jack's condition at the time of the first ambulance arrival at 00:36am was such that a higher priority backup should have been requested. Jack was symptomatic of cardiogenic shock with descending blood pressures, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, and required the highest priority backup of Cat 1 (Peri Arrest). I am concerned that the crew should have recognised the deteriorating condition when considering relevant observations such as ECG interpretation, an early recognition of such a deterioration and a correct categorisation of a backup request may have led to rapid stabilisation and transportation to definitive care. I shall be glad to be told of any learning arising from this death and timescales and results of your review. 6",29,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was; Killed unlawfully,"Mr Lynch resided in room 1 in supported living accommodation which was shared with 3 others, including the offender, at [REDACTED] Birmingham. Between 05.30 and 05.51 on 11/07/23 Mr Lynch was attacked in the garden area outside the property and decapitated by the offender. The offender was known to suffer from treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia which would be made worse if he stopped taking his medication and took illicit substances. He had been under the care of mental health services for some time. He had last been seen in clinic on 12/05/23 when he admitted he had stopped taking his medication but agreed to restart it and confirmed he had changed his address. Further efforts were made to contact him however he did not respond. There was concern at this time that his mental health condition was relapsing, and his case was discussed in an MDT on 17/05/23. An unannounced visit was made to an address on 24/05/23 when he was not present; however, it is not clear if the CPN attended his new address or the old address which remained on his clinical records. He was spoken to briefly by a CPN on 14/06/23 when he appeared intoxicated but agreed to attend a clinic appointment on 21/06/23 which he did not attend. Further attempts were made to contact him without success, but no attempts were made to contact his family or the landlord. In the days leading up to the attack the offender had been found to use weed at the address and was given a verbal warning on 26/06/23. He smashed up his room on 10/07/23 and was evicted from the property. In the past smashing up his room had been an indicator of declining mental health however this was not known to the landlord and the landlord was unaware he was under the care of the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). He was taken to City Hospital by the landlord on 10/07/23 as he was concerned about his unusual behaviour but the offender left before being seen. CCTV confirmed he returned to the property at 02.48 on 11/07/23 and was seen in the garden area having an altercation with Mr Lynch around 05.30 before at 05.51 he is seen on CCTV striking Mr Lynch with force. After he was dead the offender decapitated Mr Lynch. At 14.23 the Landlord attended the property after another resident was unable to enter. The offender admitted to the landlord that he had killed Mr Lynch and the police were called. The offender was sentenced to a hospital order for the offence of manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Multiple sharp force injuries 1b 1c 1d II","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. To Birmingham and Solihull Mental health Trust 1. Internal investigation: The internal investigation did not address how and whether the offender's use of medication should have been monitored after the clinic visit on 12/05/23. This was important as non compliance with medication was a risk factor for relapse. In addition, during the inquest the trust confirmed they had not spoken to the CPN who attempted to visit the offender on 24/05/23 to verify whether they had attended the old or new address. This was a critical issue as the new address had not been updated on the clinical notes. This raises a concern about the quality of the investigation and whether the Trust is adequately learning from incidents. To Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust and Birmingham City Council 2. Mental Health assessments: The inquest heard evidence that there were barriers to the use of S2 and S3 of the Mental health Act due to AMPH resistance, administrative challenges and resourcing. This raises a concern that incorrect MHA assessments are taking place and patients may be detained on an inappropriate section impacting patient care. A copy of a report prepared by is attached. To Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health trust, Birmingham City Council and Provident housing 3. Information sharing between agencies and support worker training: The inquest heard evidence that Landlords have to rely on the information given to them by the residents and do not have access to other key information held by other agencies. This means the landlord is often not aware of key information about an individual. Given the potential for harm for residents and support workers consideration needs to be given to how best to share information to ensure residents are receiving the right care and landlords have sufficient information to be able to monitor residents and undertake risk assessments. The inquest heard evidence that support workers need more focussed training on mental health conditions and how to manage and help residents with enduring mental health conditions. 6",65,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19/02/25.,"Javed was aged 57 and had a long-term diagnosis of somatisation disorder and paranoid schizophrenia. He was under the care of mental health services. He was known to drink alcohol to excess and use cannabis regularly, and it was recognised his mood and behaviour could be changeable and erratic. He was last reviewed by mental health clinicians on 29/02/24 when his mental health appeared settled, and he agreed to continue his medication with the next routine review in August 2024. His residential support worker and social worker recognised his behaviour could be challenging but did not consider mental health intervention was required. On 22/05, he had a 9-minute telephone consultation with a GP about a recent chest infection and known COPD with no apparent acute mental health issues. The following day, 23/05, his care co-ordinator telephoned the GP receptionist reporting his carer had reported a 3-4 day history of worsening mood and irrational behaviour, she was advised to set it out in an email for the GP. No email was sent. Carers continued to visit Javed on 23 and 24/05. On 25/05 Javed deliberately ignited his room with flammable liquid and remained in and around the fire for a prolonged period before exiting through a window when the conditions became unbearable. He was combative and aggressive with emergency services consistent with him experiencing a mental health episode. He was sedated and admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham critically unwell. Despite treatment for major burn injuries and smoke inhalation he went into multi-organ failure and died on 01/06/24. Toxicology indicated he had not been taking his anti-psychotic medication. The conclusion of the inquest was: Death was the consequence of trauma caused in a deliberately set fire however the available evidence does not reveal his intention in setting the fire.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed maƩers giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless acƟon is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The evidence demonstrated there is a conƟnuing risk that All Care In One Ltd staﬀ will not recognise and take appropriate acƟon when a service user presents with serious acute mental health issues.

(2) There was no formal internal post-death invesƟgaƟon report. (3) Whilst some post-death internal training has been idenƟﬁed it remains outstanding despite 8 months passing since the death. However, I was not saƟsﬁed this training has recognised the above concerns. 6",57,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was; accident,"Mrs Phillips resided in a care home as she suffered from Alzheimer's dementia and she took clopidogrel an antiplatelet medication to reduce the risk of clots. She required help with activities of daily living but remained mobile and would walk around the care home often at a fast pace. She was assessed as at high risk of falls and had several falls due to her constant walking. At 23.05 on 07/04/23 she fell forwards in the hallway causing an injury to her forehead and back. She was assessed and not thought to have any significant injury. 111 was called who advised further monitoring. The following day she presented as normal however from 09/04/23 her condition changed, and she appeared more sleepy and her mobility declined meaning she required more assistance. On 12/04/23 she was assessed by a GP as part of the weekly ward round who noted the fall and an injury to her right eye which was now very bruised but found no abnormalities or changes so advised further monitoring. On 13/04/23 she was noted to be struggling to walk and required a wheelchair and her mobility continued to deteriorate. After concerns were raised by her husband, she was reviewed again on 17/04/23 by a GP. The GP was not advised of any deterioration in her presentation and found no abnormal neurological signs but suspected she may have suffered a concussion from the fall. The plan was for her to be seen on the next weekly ward round, and she was given eye drops for an eye infection. She was not added to the list for the weekly ward round on 19/04/23. Mrs Phillips continued to deteriorate and require assistance and on 22/04/23 she was noted to be very sleepy. By 24/04/23 she was noted to be very unwell and struggling to walk and eat and drink independently and after review by a GP she was admitted to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital where a CT scan confirmed a large right sided traumatic subdural haemorrhage which was treated conservatively until her death on 30/04/23. It is likely she suffered a head injury when she fell on 07/04/23 and that clopidogrel caused the initial injury to worsen over time but it is not possible to say whether earlier admission to hospital would have impacted on the outcome. Based on information from the Deceased's treating clinicians the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Traumatic Subdural Hemorrhage 1b 1c 1d II",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The care home records were inaccurate and did not correctly reflect the deterioration in Mrs Phillips condition after the fall. There is a concern that this creates a risk of further deaths. 2. The risk assessment for prevention of falls was not updated when it should have been after her fall on 07/04/23 and when her condition deteriorated. There is a concern that this create a risk of further deaths as risk assessments are not up to date. 3. The post falls investigation did not adequately investigate the circumstances of the fall. There is a concern that this creates a risk of future deaths as lessons are not learnt from incidents. 6,68,N/A: Not found

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1) Delay in ambulance response attributable to delays in handover of patients at Royal Cornwall Hospital Mr Campbell had a history of recreational drug misuse with previous non-intentional overdoses. On 31/10/22, he travelled by train from St Austell to St Erth to visit a friend. While with his friend, it is understood he took drugs as he then became unconscious/fell asleep. His friend took him back to the railway station to catch the last train back to St Austell. At approximately 00:15 on 1/11/22, a bus driver saw Lachlan outside the train station. He was on his knees, bent forwards with his head on the ground in what was described as a 'prayer position.' A concern for welfare call was made to the emergency services. A police response was delayed, understandably, owing to a higher priority call being received in relation to an incident of potential domestic violence to which the Officers were diverted. The Officers arrived with Lachlan shortly after 01:00. At 01:42, a request was made for an ambulance. This resulted in a Category 2 disposal requiring an attendance within an average of 18 minutes with 90% of incidents to be attended upon within 40 minutes. The Officers left Lachlan at the scene understanding that an ambulance would arrive shortly. They had initially wondered if Lachlan was the male involved in the incident of Domestic Violence but once it was recognised he was not and that the suspect was still at large, 3 Information Classification: CONTROLLED there was a concern to apprehend the suspect to safeguard the female victim. After a downpour, Officers returned to the scene shortly before 05:00 to find Lachlan in much the same position but now soaked through. They discussed their options and the risk of hypothermia. A chasing call was made to the ambulance service and it was identified there were still 13 Category 2 or higher cases ahead of them. No ETA was provided. The Officers decided to watch Lachlan from their car. At approximately 06:00, his breathing became agonal. The outstanding call was upgraded to Category 1. An ambulance crew arrived on scene at 06:15 just over 4.5 hours after the first call against a target time of 18 minutes. The situation could not be retrieved and resuscitation efforts were abandoned as futile at 07:45. An expert, Professor Lyon, opined that had Lachlan been conveyed to hospital in a timely manner, his death would have been avoided. At inquest, the jury heard from who works in the patient safety team at South West Ambulance Service Trust. She told us: On 31 October 2022, there were over 730 hours of ambulance time lost to handovers that were over the 15 minute target at RCHT, Derriford Hospital and North Devon District Hospital (NDDH). This is equivalent to approximately 66 DCA ambulance shifts lost to delays (based on a standard 11 hour shift). At RCHT, the average handover time per patient was one hour, 55 minutes and 57 seconds. At Derriford, the average handover was seven hours, five minutes and four seconds. At NDDH, the average handover was two hours, 12 minutes and 27 seconds. These events happened some time ago and I wanted to know if the situation had improved in the meantime. I was advised that in January 2025, the average handover time per patient at Royal Cornwall Hospital was just under 2 hours 15 minutes, in other words, the situation has worsened. This gives rise to an obvious concern and it is in these circumstances that I write to you. May I also take the opportunity to bring to your attention that I have written Preventing Future Death (PFD) reports with the same concerns to two previous Ministers. I am aware some of my colleagues have additionally written with the same concerns. Included in the Reply to my first PFD was a response from , the Chief Executive of the local ICB (to whom this is copied) which set out, most helpfully, a plan of action over the coming years to relieve the current pressures. It is entirely a matter for you how you choose to reply to this report but you may feel an update from Ms Shields would be informative. 2) Information Sharing There is a concern also about how information was shared between the police and ambulance service. Both police officers said that, had they been aware of the extent of ambulance delays, 4 Information Classification: CONTROLLED they may have considered other options, notably, conveying Lachlan to hospital in a police car. I am writing separately to SWAST and Devon & Cornwall Police in this regard and your reply does not need to address this concern. 6",51,N/A: Not found

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1) Delays in ambulance attendance. I have written to the Secretary of State separately in this regard and you do not need to address this in your reply. 2) Information sharing between SWAST and D&CP. A number of issues were revealed during the course of the evidence. a) A concern for welfare call was received by police at circa 00:15. Officers attended on scene at circa 01:00 and chased an ambulance at 01:42 only to find one had not been previously called resulting in an initial delay of nearly 1.5 hours. b) The initial caller had been a bus driver. His mobile details were not taken and so SWAST was unable to call him back for further information they required. When police officers were asked for their numbers, they provided their shoulder numbers, not their mobile numbers. SWAST thus had incomplete information when considering what disposition was appropriate. c) Police Officers were advised the call had resulted in a Category 2 disposition but were not provided with an ETA. The target time was 18 minutes but an ambulance did not arrive until 06:15, some 4.5 hours later. Had Officers been aware of the likely delays, their evidence was that they would have considered other options (such as conveying Lachlan to hospital in their car.) d) In reaching a Category 2 disposition, SWAST understood the Officers were remaining with Lachlan. In the event, they left him to deal with an unresolved domestic violence incident. At inquest, evidence was given that, had this been known to SWAST, a Category 1/2 disposition may have been reached. e) In the event Officers had concluded there was a need to convey Lachlan to hospital, it would have meant there were no available Officers in the Penzance area. While this is a matter for police to reflect upon, it was notable the Officers' supervisor 4 Information Classification: CONTROLLED was not contacted to discuss options. f) The inquest heard that in other countries (USA) there are arrangements in place for police to drop victims in need of urgent treatment at hospital (eg stabbings) without being detained for extended periods (current handover for ambulance crews in excess of 2 hours.) If ambulance delays are set to continue and police may need increasingly to convey patients to hospital, is there value in considering whether arrangements of this nature would be beneficial? 6",51,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 20 th February 2025. The Medical Cause of Death was: 1 (a) Hypoxic brain injury (b) Choking (c) Inhalation of adhesive gel 2. Dementia The conclusion of the Inquest recorded Accident","In August 2022 Mr Jones was diagnosed with dementia and on 6/9/22 he took up residence at a care home which specialised in such care. On 23/6/24 a member of staff found Mr Jones in his room with denture adhesive gel in his mouth, ears and nose. Attempts were made to remove the substance from his mouth. Mr Jones' breathing became laboured and paramedics attended and took him to hospital where his health deteriorated and he died on 23/6/24.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. Mr Jones lived in a self-contained unit at the care home where he had his own room and en suite facilities.

ii. Upon his arrival risk assessments were carried out including choking hazards and a full Care Plan created which included oral care.

iii. Although Mr Jones was living with dementia, he was able to care for himself except for being prompted and with the support from one care staff with his personal care.

iv. He had capacity to make daily non-complex decisions. He wished to maintain his independence as far as possible with all aspects of his daily care needs. He was able to manage elements of his own daily personal care which included oral care.

v. Mr Jones had upper and lower dentures which he secured in place on a daily basis using an adhesive gel. He had daily access to this gel which was stored in his bathroom cabinet. There were no reported concerns regarding his daily access to the adhesive gel. The gel and other toiletries were provided by his family.

vi. When paramedics attended on 23/6/24 they attempted to remove the gel with a suction machine but were unsuccessful.

vii. At autopsy there was evidence of upper airway obstruction by thick adhesive gel. This thick adhesive gel was seen inside the mouth and pharynx and had completely blocked the larynx and trachea and extended into the left bronchus

viii. The packaging of the gel was examined and there was no warning on either the box or the enclosed leaflet that gave a warning that the gel was a potential choking hazard.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. The choking risk which this product poses. The qualities of the product are such that a thick adhesive gel can become lodged deep into the respiratory system and can be extremely difficult to remove

ii. Such a product is likely to be used by the older generation and those who may be suffering from a decline of brain functioning.

iii. Such a product should be considered as part of any risk assessment for those living in a care home setting.

iv. There is no warning on the product packaging or on the enclosed information leaflet as to the risk of choking.",92,N/A: Not found

The Medical Cause of Death was: 1 (a) Urinary Sepsis (b) Severe acute on chronic cystitis and pyelonephritis (c) Chronic ketamine use The conclusion of the Inquest recorded Drug Related Death","Mr Leatham-Prosser had started misusing ketamine in 2019. He developed bladder problems and significant pain which then led to self medicating with ketamine for pain relief.

On 5/6/24, following concerns for his welfare, Mr Leatham-Prosser was found unresponsive in the hallway of his home address by paramedics. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Dorset Police investigated and found no evidence of third party involvement.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. Mr Leatham-Prosser had started taking Cannabis as a young teenager and at the age of 17 progressed on to taking ketamine. He did not perceive this to be any more harmful than cannabis.

ii. The evidence before the inquest was that ketamine was a highly addictive drug.

iii. Ketamine cystitis is an emerging epidemic in the younger population with access to this drug seemingly easy to acquire. The extremely harmful effect of this drug on the bladder is akin to acid attacks on the skin.

iv. Patients seen by urologists are abusing the drug to the extent required to damage the urinary tract to the point of requiring major reconstructive surgery. The only way patients know how to relieve their symptoms is with ongoing ketamine use. A vicious cycle develops worsening the urological condition and reinforces dependence on the drug with high rates of relapse.

i. The highly addictive and harmful nature of a drug with a classification of Class B.

ii. The increasing number of young people presenting with potentially fatal health problems linked to its use.",26,N/A: Not found

On 19th December 2024 I concluded the Inquest. At the time of her death Mrs Marking lived independently and was 77 years of age. The medical cause of death given was: 1a Respiratory failure and Sepsis 1b Aspiration of feculent gastric contents at induction of anaesthesia 1c. Strangulated femoral hernia I found: On 16th February 2024 Pamela Anne Marking - who was unable to give a complete history due to cognitive issues - was admitted to the Emergency Department at East Surrey Hospital. Redhill from her home address after unknowingly vomiting blood-stained fluid, with right sided and suprapubic abdominal tenderness. She was diagnosed as having had an epistaxis (nosebleed) by a Physician Associate and discharged home later that afternoon without a medical review or direct medical supervision of the Physician Associate who had a lack of understanding of the significance of abdominal pain and vomiting and had undertaken an incomplete abdominal examination which would have been likely to have found a right femoral hernia. Mrs Marking re-presented to the Emergency Department two days later with grossly dilated small bowel obstruction due to an incarcerated right femoral hernia containing ischaemic bowel requiring emergency surgery later that evening. A rapid sequence induction (RSI) of anaesthesia to protect her airway from aspiration of gastric contents was undertaken with Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (Propofol and Remifentanil and thereafter Rocuronium), in the absence of cricoid pressure and with a nasogastric tube in situ attached to the only suction device. This approach was considered a commonly deployed and safe technique in the absence of updated national guidelines. On induction of anaesthesia, Mrs Marking aspirated feculent fluid resulting in respiratory failure in the immediate post operative period requiring re-intubation and intensive care input. Despite maximal support Mrs Marking died at East Surrey hospital, Redhill on 20th February 2024. The clinical management Mrs Marking had on her first admission and thereafter during the Rapid Sequence Induction materially contributed to her death.",Please see my findings above,"1. The term 'Physician Associate' is misleading to the public Mrs Marking's son was under the mistaken belief that the Physician Associate was a doctor by this title in circumstances where no steps were taken by the Emergency Department or the Physician Associate to explain or clearly differentiate their role from that of medically qualified practitioners. 2. Lack of public understanding of the role of Physician Associate Witnesses from the Trust gave evidence that a Physician Associate was clinically equivalent to a Tier 2 resident doctor without evidence to support this belief. This blurring of roles without public knowledge and understanding of the role of a Physician Associate has the potential to devalue and undermine public confidence in the medical profession whilst allowing Physician Associates to potentially undertake roles outside of their competency thereby compromising patient safety. 3. The right of patients and family to seek a second opinion The lack of public knowledge that a Physician Associate is not medically qualified has the potential to hinder requests by patients and their relatives who would wish to seek an opinion from a medical practitioner. It also raises issues of informed consent and protection of patient rights if the public are not aware or have not been properly informed that they are being treated by a Physician Associate rather than a medically qualified doctor. 4. Lack of national and local guidelines and regulation of the scope of practice for a Physician Associate A diagnosis of epistaxis was made by the Physician Associate without appreciating the relevance of the vomiting and lower abdominal discomfort and in the absence of understanding the need to undertake palpation of the groins in an abdominal examination in a patient who was unable to give a proper clinical history because of short term memory loss. No evidence was presented that the management of Mrs Marking was subject to a reflective practice review. Given their limited training and in the absence of any national or local recognised hospital training for Physician Associates once appointed, this gives rise to a concern they are working outside of their capabilities. 5. Lack of guidelines for direct supervision and consideration of an appropriate level of autonomy for Physician Associates Whilst there were discussions with the 'supervising' consultant the Physician Associate was effectively acting independently in the diagnosis, treatment, management and discharge of Mrs Marking without independent oversight by a medical practitioner. This gives rise to a concern that inadequate supervision or excessive delegation of undifferentiated patients in the Emergency Department to Physician Associates compromises patient safety. 6. Lack of 'Updated' National Guidelines for Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) of Anaesthesia for emergency surgery Mrs Marking required a rapid sequence induction to protect her airway from aspiration of bowel contents as a consequence of small bowel obstruction. The consultant anaesthetist gave evidence that the 'traditional' use of consecutive syringes of induction agent and muscle relaxant was obsolete, and it was common practice locally and nationally to routinely undertake a RSI with Total Intravenous Anaesthesia, in the absence of updated local or national guidelines to support this practice. 7. Lack of 'Updated' National Guidelines to support the use of TIVA for RSI Other than empirically increasing the rate of infusion of TIVA agents (Propofol and Remifentanil) no evidence was forthcoming as to the target range required to ensure and confirm an adequate depth of anaesthesia for patients or the length of time required prior to and following the administration of a muscle relaxant (Rocuronium) to facilitate intubation. This is despite TIVA being known to provide a slower onset of anaesthesia and approximately 50% of all anaesthetic related deaths are due to aspiration (NAP 4). 8. Lack of 'Updated' Guidelines for use of Cricoid pressure and other measures to protect the airway in a RSI anaesthetic Evidence was heard that as cricoid pressure was ineffective it was not routinely applied for a RSI intubation. After aspiration on Induction, the only suction device was attached to the nasogastric tube giving rise to a possible delay in timely suctioning of the feculent aspirate which was in excess of two litres after intubation was achieved.",77,N/A: Not found

The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Amy Marie Padley had a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder ('EUPD') and historically had a diagnosis of depression and is recorded as having problems with an eating disorder and body dysmorphia. From the age of 16 and then for many years Amy had was prescribed various anti-depressant and other medications. Amy also suffered from a longstanding and harmful addiction to alcohol which escalated closer in time to her death in a context of family divorce and family breakdown. Amy had some limited early involvement with community mental health services when she was young and then had not engaged. In the two years before her death Amy had overdosed twice and had experienced some fleeting suicidal ideation and had been admitted to hospital. Roughly four months before her death Amy had undergone an emergency alcohol detoxification in a hospital setting whilst on the waiting list for alcohol services from a third sector agency. Amy had engaged with a number of third sector agencies in the two years before her death to help with her alcohol addiction, but her engagement had been sporadic, and she often disengaged. Amy had also been offered and turned down appointments to see mental health professionals. Amy was engaged with one third sector agency at the time of her death. Three weeks before her death Amy overdosed on a dangerous level of medication but then felt remorse and expressed plans for the future. Amy had also expressed wanting psychiatric input to assist with overcoming her alcohol addiction. Amy was discharged from hospital after being assessed by Liaison Psychiatry but was not referred to the community mental health team as the view was that Amy first needed to address her alcohol addiction. There were several opportunities that were missed by Swansea University Bay Health Board ('SUBHB') staff to refer Amy to the community mental health team for assessment in the primary care setting including when Amy overdosed on 18 June 2022 shortly before her death. I find that that this was because too much emphasis was placed by SUBHB staff on Amy needing to seek help to first addresses her alcohol addiction with insufficient consideration given to Amy's underlying mental health diagnosis and the role that may have been playing in her mental health deterioration. There was also insufficient attention given to the difficulties Amy faced in engaging with third sector organisations for her alcohol addiction and her inability to consistently seek help for herself and whether this was because of her mental health diagnosis. Amy was known to engage in impulsive and dangerous acts of self-harm and to experience suicidal thoughts when intoxicated and that Amy was suffering from long-standing alcohol addiction. I consider that this posed a risk to her life and that this risk (i.e. life- threatening self-harm when intoxicated and when having suicidal thoughts) was not given sufficient consideration when she was discharged by Liaison Psychiatry three weeks before her death. There were several missed opportunities for mental health services to try and engage Amy before her death so that they could assess her and undertake a medication review. I am unable to say whether these missed opportunities contributed to Amy's death as I do not know whether Amy would have engaged with any appointment that she was offered and whether an assessment would have been arranged and/or had any meaningful impact before Amy took her own life. On the 8 July 2022 Amy was found by her daughter, hanging [REDACTED]. Attending paramedics and Police confirmed the death at 06.50hrs. I am satisfied that Amy took her own life and intended to do so.",The deceased Amy Marie Padley. Amy Marie Padley suffered from alcohol addiction and depression and was diagnosed with an EUPD. On 18 June 2022 Amy overdosed and had an inpatient admission. Amy was then discharged by Liaison Psychiatry with no mental health follow up. Amy was found deceased at her home having taken her own life by suspension and was declared deceased on 8 July 2022 at 06.50.,"During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 The MATTERS OF CONCERN is as follows: I am concerned about the evidence I heard in this inquest that when an individual is suffering from alcohol or drug addiction alongside a mental health diagnosis, which in this case was EUPD and depression, that the focus of SUBHB is normally to advise that individual to address their addiction before they can access mental health services. I heard that addiction services do not fall within the remit of SUBHB and are provided by third-sector agencies. I heard that individuals who have a mental health diagnosis may self -medicate to manage symptoms of a mental health deterioration and that increased use of alcohol/drugs can increase the risk of self-harm to such individuals which may prove fatal. I am concerned that there is no guidance to staff within SBUHB on how to manage individuals with addiction and a mental health diagnosis and how SUBHB staff should liaise with and work alongside third-sector agencies in respect of an individual suffering from addiction. I am also concerned that there appears to be a reluctance within SBUHB to offer mental health support alongside suggesting that an individual access addiction services. I am concerned that this may mean that individuals in mental health crisis and suffering from addiction may not be getting the mental health assessment and support that they require alongside seeking to overcome their addiction and as such there is continuing risk to life. 6",66,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide 1a Asphyxia 1b Hanging 1c II,"The Deceased hanged himself in his prison cell overnight on 27/28 March 2022. The jury found that this was suicide. He had spoken to his wife at about 2100 hours on 27 March 2022. She believed he was suicidal and likely to take his life. She, and Cambridgeshire Police and the Metropolitan Police, were all unable to contact he prison by telephone to warn them. It later transpired that this was because the calls were being diverted to an unmanned or obsolete number. The Deceased's wife drove from Cambridge to the prison, two hours away. She stood outside the main gate for some considerable time, banging on it, calling out and pressing a buzzer which promised to connect her to an intercom through which she could speak to prison staff. The intercom was out of action and had been for several years. In the result, the Deceased's wife and the police could not contact the prison all night During that night, the Deceased took his life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed the following matter giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. - The buzzer/intercom system must have been provided because it was thought important to provide that additional means of communication between the prison and the outside world. In this case, a working system would have enabled the Deceased's wife to warn the prison of his impending suicide. This could happen again in the future if there was another problem with the telephone system during the night state. It is difficult to understand why the buzzer/intercom system has not worked for several years. There was evidence that it is irreparable. But the proposed solution appeared to be either to leave it as it is (still not working) or to remove it altogether. The jury found that the failure to provide a working buzzer/intercom system was a failure. It is a matter of concern that the prison/the Ministry of Justice still considers that it is unnecessary. 6",0,N/A: Not found

Department of Health 4. Royal College of Psychiatrists 5. Care Quality Commission, Chief Executive 1","On 21st January 2022, as Senior Coroner, London Inner South, after a Safeguarding Adults Investigation, I opened an inquest into the death of Mr Luke Alexander Worrell, who had died in hospital aged 39 on 2nd January 2021. The inquest was concluded on 7th September 2023, having called an expert pharmaceutical physician. On 21st September 2023 I took urgent sick leave. I resigned from my position on 31st October 2023, after which I had no jurisdiction. On 21st September 2024, I received a request, in my new role as Assistant Coroner in South London, to determine whether a preventing future death report was needed. I agreed and the case was transferred on 27th November and I was given access to the case file on 27th January 2025. Submissions as to the need for a PFD report were filed, but in view of the passage of time, I do not consider it fair to issue a report to those involved with his care now in 2025, on the basis of evidence 16 months ago about a death 4 years ago. However the issues are potentially generic and so I address my report to national organizations. The medical cause of death was: 1a Ruptured Oesophagus 1b Vomiting from ileus 1c Gastro-intestinal upset from Clozapine administration II Treatment resistant schizophrenia, urinary tract infection The narrative conclusion was: He died from unintended consequences of necessary medical treatment. There were two significant failures in care, which contributed to his death. The first was a failure to recognize the side effect of Clozapine on his gastro-intestinal tract. The second was the failure to recognize the level of risk Mr Worrell presented to himself after discharge, and in particular the failure to recognise the need for face to face assessment by a psychiatrist in response to his presentation on 7th and 14th December 2020, which amounted to neglect. 4","Mr Worrell suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, dissocial personality disorder and some learning difficulty. He spent most of his life in hospital detention or custodial settings. He had a history of illicit substance misuse, non- compliance with medication and non-engagement with health services. During the Covid pandemic, he was discharged from hospital on 28th October 2020 on oral Clozapine. His mother, the GP and his 24 hour support service had not contributed to discharge planning. He was assessed on the day before discharge as having “less capacity to make informed decisions about his follow up” and he refused the Home Treatment Team's input post discharge. His mother considered he was not ready for discharge; the residential support service wanted him to remain under mental health (MH) section on section 17 leave, as it enabled much easier recall to hospital. This was not considered by the psychiatrist who was his responsible physician as its use had 'fallen out of practice' and he was instead the subject of a community treatment order. On 7th December he declined medication, opened his door naked with a delusion that there was a t-shirt on his mattress touching which would cause death and socks would kill Stevie. It was suspected that he had bought Spice instead of food, and alcohol was found in his room, but neither the care coordinator nor psychiatrist considered that he needed a MH assessment, despite having demonstrated almost all relapse indicators in his contingency and relapse plan, which required one. By 14th December he had persistent vomiting, stopped eating, self-isolated with a barricade and refused medication. 111 was called as support staff and CC felt he should be taken to hospital. The GP identified the self neglect but Mr Worrell declined to speak to him on the phone and referred to mental health. Ambulance services were severely stretched by Covid, and the paramedic in the early hours inappropriately accepted that Mr Worrell did not need waking and applied a triage assessment without consultation and made a referral back to mental health services. He took his Clozapine on 16th and was eating, but refused to attend the clinic. By 17th he had failed to attend two review meetings with his psychiatrist, attendances at the clinic and GP consultations, which persisted. On 22nd a GP telephoned and was reassured that he was about to attend the Clozapine clinic and lack of red flags and advised being taken to A&E if he worsened. His mother persuaded him to attend the clinic with her, but he collapsed there and was taken to A&E on a best interests basis. He was grossly dehydrated, partially conscious and confused, with a severe metabolic alkalosis due to persistent loss of gastric acid from vomiting, requiring intensive care. His GI tract was dilated with a significant amount of fluid, due to an ileusfrom Clozapine administration, which was not recognised and was continued, but probably absorbing little. His care was complicated by postural pneumonitis, confusion preventing reinsertion of NG tube and an arterial line being blocked. He had a coffee ground vomit on 31st December and this caused a rupture of a weakened oesophagus and a deterioration the next day leading to a cardiac arrest, from which resuscitation was inevitably unsuccessful. He died at 11.00 hours on 2nd January in hospital.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The lack of awareness by a series of clinical staff of the potential fatal side effects of Clozapine 2. Inappropriate use of community treatment order, when there was sufficient evidence to keep on a MHA section. 6",39,N/A: Not found

The cause of death was recorded as being due to 1(a) Peritonitis , Acute Liver Failure and Bronchopneumonia 1b Gall Bladder Perforation 1c Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography due to obstructive jaundice and the conclusion of the inquest was that the death was due to medical misadventure.","The circumstances of the death are that Miss Cotgrave had been admitted to Glan Clwyd Hospital on the 31 st of March 2022 and was being investigated to establish the cause of her jaundice. She did not undergo a required ERCP until the 19 th of April and on the 22 nd of April was found to have sustained a perforation which is likely to have occurred in the course of that procedure. By that time she was too unwell to undergo reparative surgery and she passed away on the 3 rd of May 2022. The delay in her undergoing the ERCP was due (inter alia) to the consultant gastroenterologist requesting that advice from tertiary centre in Liverpool be obtained prior to the procedure due to a suspicion of malignancy. He was subsequently informed that advice had been received indicating the ERCP should be undertaken at Glan Clwyd and he therefore proceeded. Whilst there is no reason to doubt the veracity of the consultant's evidence, that advice from the tertiary centre had been sought, there is no documented evidence in relation this.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed the following matter giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. – That there was no record of any discussions which took place been Glan Clwyd and the tertiary centre and no formal documented process in relation to such referrals and the subsequent advice which was provided and thereafter acted upon.

On 10th April 2024 I was assigned to investigate this legacy case. The inquest engaged Article 2 ECHR and concluded on 19 h December 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1a Asphyxia. 1b Suspension by neck The conclusion as to his death was recorded as: Mr Dunne committed suicide after absconding from urgent health care in an A&E department. Various failures in health care have contributed to his death: a) Failure of MH nurse at about 22.00 to make an adequate risk assessment and care plan, in particular not instructing 1:1 observations. b) Failure of a MH nurse in Home Treatment Team at 00.45 when he was intoxicated to make a meaningful risk management plan c) Failure of a MH nurse at around 03.00 to record and communicate at the time he finished his observations that Mr Dunne was high risk and required 1:1 observations d) Failure of an A&E triage nurse around 01.40 to escalate a deterioration in mental state when inserting the IV line e) Failure of the nurse in charge in the A&E department to ensure any observations after 03.30, when he was left on his own. Without these failures he would have been supervised, formally risk and capacity reassessed and either detained under the Mental Health Act and/or prevented from leaving and so would not have died when he did.","Mr Paul Dunne had a history of depression, anxiety, episodic alcohol abuse, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and two voluntary admissions to a mental health ward. He was brought to Princess Royal University Hospital A&E department at 20.40 on 1st January 2020, after an overdose of Paracetamol, having been persuaded by his family and emergency services personnel. He was at high risk of suicide and required continuous 1:1 observations, but never had them. There were poor communications between MH staff and A&E staff, exacerbated by separate medical recording. He deceitfully absconded four times whilst in the department, twice purchasing and drinking more alcohol. Security staff were not alerted to his risks. He did not have repeated risk or capacity assessments, nor have a Mental Health Act assessment, despite his circumstances and mental state deteriorating. After removing his IV line, he finally absconded for the final time, which could have been prevented. Police were notified, briefed by the A&E department just before 05.30 and took steps to find him, following their Missing Persons Policy. He was found dead, having suspended himself in the nearby children's playground, at 07.47 on 2nd January.","Many of the failings have been addressed locally. But during the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN addressed to Oxleas and CQC are as follows. – 1. Individual mental health professionals appeared to have gaps in knowledge and judgment. The director who was spokesperson for the Mental Health Trust did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of these deficits.  A mental health liaison nurse, who now is manager of these nurses, did not recognize the patient as high risk, despite his having been persuaded to attend A&E by the police against his will, having just expressed suicidal ideation, made a previous attempt, with alcohol intoxication and absconsion, as at the time he denied suicidality. Even in retrospect in court she did not acknowledge her misjudgement. She also asserted incorrectly that a patient who has mental capacity cannot be assessed under the Mental Health Act.  A mental health nurse of 9 years standing in the Home Treatment Team who acknowledged the risk to the patient's life could hardly be higher, failed to document his assessment, as he could not find anywhere to write it before going on his break. No staff acknowledged that he had informed them of the risk. He assumed the patient would get 1:1 monitoring, but did not direct anyone to the need. When asked what he would have done if he had known there were no staff to conduct 1:1 monitoring, he said that he could perhaps hang around for a bit longer. 2. The Mental Health Trust  Staff and it appears the director even at the time of the inquest did not appreciate that the A&E policies (Missing Persons, Shared Care) which required risk assessment after an absconsion and alerting managers to the need for extra temporary staff if 1:1 monitoring was needed, also applied to MH staff.  Evidence was heard that staff in KCH A&E and Oxleas NH Trust had been trained on different risk assessment documents. Although meetings had been reinstated between departments, there had been no audit of absconsions or MH liaison in A&E. The MATTERS OF CONCERN addressed to NHSE and DH are as follows. 3. MH staff and A&E staff write their clinical records in different systems and hospital staff do not have access to MH Rio records. MH staff attending A&E departments are asked to make a double entry in the A&E records as well. Here that was omitted, potentially with fatal risks. Moving to a combined electronic system (now identified as EPIC) has long been the aim of the local health providers, but evidence was heard that the pace of introduction, which is very slow, is in the hands of national NHS leadership. 6",45,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 January 2025. I do apologise for the late provision of this report. I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide.","Mr Holloway jumped off a bridge at approximately 5am on Thursday, 18 July 2024 and was killed by the impact with the railway tracks below.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. For BCAP: 1. Mr Holloway's BCAP accredited psychotherapist did not make any notes of her consultations with him, because he had asked her not to. She gave evidence that she is not bound by law or ethics to keep any notes. Is it appropriate that there is no minimum standard of note keeping following psychotherapy consultations? 2. The psychotherapist said that she had never before had a client who was suicidal. She said that this is not taught at university, though she had completed a post graduate course in working with suicidal ideation. Can it be right that suicidality is completely omitted from BCAP accredited psychotherapy training? 3. When Mr Holloway's friend contacted the psychotherapist to say that he was missing, knowing that he had neither attended nor cancelled their last consultation the psychotherapist was very concerned for his safety. She instructed the friend to go round to his home, but it did not occur to her to call the police. The friend did this, but can it be right that contacting the police in such a situation is not taught as part of psychotherapy planning? 4. The psychotherapist explained in court that she was angry that Mr Holloway's friend disclosed to her that Mr Holloway had died, asking the friend: “Do you have any idea how this impacts me and my ability to do my job going forward?” The psychotherapist said that she (the psychotherapist) was in distress and shock. 3 In hindsight, the psychotherapist said that she wished she had referred Mr Holloway to a psychotherapist with more experience in suicidality, she said at inquest because she did not want to be in this situation again with this responsibility. Should there be a mechanism of ensuring that a psychotherapist who is unable to deal with suicidality does not practise with clients who may experience this? For BCAP and North West London NHS Trust: 5. Mr Holloway was seen and fully assessed by North West London clinicians when he was taken to hospital by police following an episode of self harm on 30 June 2024. Police attendance had been prompted by Mr Holloway's brother, calling from abroad. Mr Holloway's brother was particularly disappointed that it seemed as if Mr Holloway's care was not joined up between the different agencies. 6",36,N/A: Not found

Road Traffic Collision","Paul Stephen Collingridge died on 6 December 2022 of Multiple Traumatic Injuries sustained when his motorcycle high sided on an unlit road in the hours of darkness following sudden braking on the approach to roadworks ejecting him into the path of oncoming traffic. Mr Collingridge was travelling on the Colchester bound single carriageway navigating a bend when there was queuing traffic and was struck by an oncoming vehicle that had no opportunity to take avoiding action on the B1027 Colchester Road at junction with Frowick Lane, St Osyth. The roadworks for utility repairs had been put in place overnight and the required permit was not in place.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Where Road Works Permits are required by utility companies these are often urgent to carry out vital repairs. This can mean that roadworks are set up in hours of darkness and may cause difficulties calculating distances as set out in the Safety at Street Works Code of Practice. (2) The Safety of Street Works Code of Practice sets out how to take measurements to set out street works that include utlising street furniture that are at set distances and standard road markings that have standard lengths on carriageways with specific road speeds. a. Some carriageways do not have street furniture b. Some of the road markings on the carriage where the fatal collision did not comply to standard lengths and therefore the markings can have variations. c. The Code of Practice does not set out how to calculate the distance where there is road curvature where the road markings have differing lengths on opposing sides where the markings are delineated on bends in a carriageway. (3) A road works warning sign was placed at the junction that joined the carriageway of a road that obscured visibility of traffic joining the main carriageway. Whilst this did not cause or contribute to this incident this was not in accordance with the Code of Practice. (4) The fatal incident that occurred on 6 December 2022 was not notified on the retrospective permit application for roadworks on the following day.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was Janet Scott was 60 years old. She lived in Haltwhistle, Northumbria. Ms Scott had a complex medical history. She had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was diabetic. As result of her conditions Ms Scott struggled to care for herself in later life. She was very vulnerable. Ms Scott lived in social housing. She required regular support with her mental and physical health needs. She struggled to maintain her home and ensure that it remained clean and safe. Ms Scott was at serious risk of self-neglect. In 2022 attempts began to rehouse Ms Scott. Unfortunately, it was not easy to identify a suitable alternative address in the small area in which she was willing to live. As a result, she remained at the same address until a scheduled move in March 2023. On 7th March 2023 Ms Scott's Community Psychiatric Nurse ('CPN') contacted Adult Social Care. She had been allowed entry into Ms Scott's home and was very concerned. She described 'squalor': a property full of rubbish bags, with a build-up of food parcels that Ms Scott was not using. On that day, Ms Scott had been kneeling when she answered the door. On the next day, Ms Scott was visited by her support worker. She was observed to be dishevelled, exhibiting poor personal hygiene and struggling to walk. Following these encounters, there was a failure to activate multi-agency safeguarding procedures. Multiple attempts were made to contact ASC over the coming days, but these were not responded to with sufficient speed or rigour. Ms Scott was visited on 20th March 2023 but no immediate risk to her was recognised. Ms Scott was found at home, unresponsive, on 28th March 2023. She had developed sepsis. Ms Scott was transported to the Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, by ambulance. She died there on 30th March 2023. Ms Scott's death was confirmed at 17:50. It is more likely than not that Ms Scott's self-neglect, her living conditions in the last weeks of her life, and the very limited medical assistance provided to her in those weeks caused or contributed to Ms Scott's death. Ms Scott's death was contributed to by neglect, being the failure to procure basic medical care for her after concerns were raised on 7th March 2023. 1a Sepsis 1b 1c II Diabetes Mellitus and Schizophrenia","Ms Scott had a serious tendency toward self-neglect. She was a 'hoarder' and her living conditions were seriously unsanitary. She was also without a functioning boiler for 18 months after her gas supply was capped. Prior to Ms Scott's death there were numerous occasions on which her self-neglect was apparent to different agencies. Although it is true that Ms Scott was often unwilling to accept help, I heard evidence of several occasions on which there had been missed opportunities to provide assistance. To their substantial credit, many of the agencies involved in Ms Scott's situation provided evidence to me of the steps they have taken to avoid a repeat. There was a consensus that more could and should have been done to adopt a multi-agency approach to safeguarding.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Although individual agencies referred me to training they had provided to staff since Ms Scott's death, I also received evidence that, for instance, the GP surgery might not raise a safeguarding referral if the same circumstances were repeated because social services had already been informed. This leads me to be concerned that the message that 'safeguarding is everyone's responsibility' has not been taken on board. I am concerned that future cases will occur in which a multiagency approach is not adopted or that individuals will not make safeguarding referrals because they assume that other agencies are already aware of the issue.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. When planning for Ms Beavington's discharge from hospital, it was agreed that the best place for her to go was a local crisis house. Upon application, the foundation year 1 doctor (FY1) was told by the crisis house team that this was not possible because: - Ms Beavington had secure accommodation; and - she was no longer actively suicidal. This was despite the fact that: - there was a strong suspicion that Ms Beavington was the victim of cuckooing in her own home; and - the team view was that she was definitely at risk of suicide. The consultant psychiatrist in charge of Ms Beavington's care did not give the FY1 any instruction as to how to challenge the decision that the consultant believed was wrong. Instead, the consultant instructed the FY1 to leave it for three days and then just try again in the same way. By this time, Ms Beavington decided that she had waited too long and did not want another attempt to be made.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Natural Causes,"Mr Unwin was a 68 years old gentleman who was admitted to Royal Stoke University hospital on 2 April 2024 at 00:45 due to fever, shortness of breath and chest pain. He was commenced on broad spectrum antibiotics within an hour of his arrival for suspected sepsis due to Urinary Tract Infection although it was subsequently confirmed that sepsis was secondary to pneumonia. He remained in the resus area of the Emergency Department despite a progressive deterioration in his condition and escalations from the nursing team to the medical team for him to be reviewed. Transfer to ICU was not initiated until approximately 14:30 at which time he was noted to be acutely unwell and in peri arrest. After being transferred to ICU at approximately 16:00 supportive intervention including sedation, ventilation and vasopresser medication failed to reverse his condition and he passed away in hospital on 3 April 2024 due to multi organ failure secondary to pneumonia.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Although the conclusion of the inquest was one of Natural Causes there was evidence of a failure for medical teams to respond to concerns that the patient was deteriorating whilst awaiting assessment in the resuscitation area of the Emergency Department of Royal Stoke University Hospital. It was accepted by witnesses from the hospital that the patient should not have deteriorated to a 'moribund' state within that area of the hospital when concerns Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 had been raised by staff and family, and that review and escalation to intensive care should have been initiated sooner (albeit the evidence was that this did not more than minimally contribute to the death). As a result of the concerns raise by hospital staff regarding missed opportunities to escalate care in a timely manner the hospital undertook a Patent Safety Incident Investigation (PSII). As a result of that investigations a number of recommendations were made with assurances given to the report author that work is being undertaken to review and amend policies and procedures focused on reviewing, escalating and referring deteriorating patients. However, the inquest was told that although the Emergency Department Resuscitation area was where the illest patients were placed awaiting review, staffing levels were not in compliance with national guidance. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) “Nursing Workforce Standards for Type 1 Emergency Departments” (Appendix 5) states “There will be a minimum of Registered Nurse to each patient in the resuscitation area”. The recommendation continued that there should be a named nurse allocated to each patient which should be 1:1 as per National Guidance. The concern is that the current model of staffing within the Emergency Department Resus area is not in compliance with national guidance and the recommendations following internal investigation into the care afforded to the deceased have not been acted upon in this respect. 6",68,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 th January 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was NARRATIVE: Died from the complications of an unobserved fall that occurred in the Emergency Department during a prolonged wait for an inpatient bed. The medical cause of death was 1a) Bronchopneumonia 1b) Neck of Femur Fracture (operated on) 1c) Fall II) Frailty, Vascular Dementia, Acute Kidney Injury.",Kenneth James Clayton was taken to Tameside General Hospital after two falls at his home address. He was assessed as requiring inpatient admission to a medical ward. Whilst waiting for an inpatient bed to become available he had an unobserved fall in the Emergency Department. He was found to have fractured his neck of femur and was operated on. Post operatively he deteriorated and developed complications from the fracture and operation. He died at Tameside General Hospital on 23rd August 2024.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest heard evidence that a key factor in the fall was the prolonged time Mr Clayton was in the Emergency Department waiting for a bed to become available on a ward. The evidence was that he had been in the emergency department for about 8 hours when he fell. The inquest was told that the design of an Emergency Department is not suited to a need for prolonged observation of high falls risk patients. In addition generally patients are cared for on hospital trolleys which cannot be lowered in the way a hospital bed can be which further increases the risk of falls. 2. Prolonged waits in Emergency Department were on the evidence given to the inquest not unusual. As an example the court was told that on the morning the inquest was heard there were patients who had been waiting 40 hours for a bed on a ward. 3. The inquest was told that the primary reason for the challenges in moving patients through the Emergency Department was availability of beds. The evidence given was that the main challenge in freeing up beds was delayed discharge of patients who were medically ready for discharge but who needed a care package or a care home place to facilitate a safe discharge. 4. The inquest was told that for patient safety it was important, that whilst there were delays in ED throughput of patients, that a robust falls risk management system was in place. Tameside Hospital had put additional measures in place to manage falls risk in ED in a more consistent way but it was unclear what steps were in place nationally to manage falls risk in a consistent way in Emergency Departments. 6",72,N/A: Not found

The inquest was resumed on 27 January 2025 and concluded on 19 February 2025.

The medical cause of Mrs Rodgers' death was:

1a.Congestive Cardiac Failure

1b Aortic Stenosis and Urinary Tract Infection

2. Rib and Spinal Fractures, Decubitus Ulcer (operated) and Frailty of Old Age

A narrative conclusion was recorded at Box 4 of the Record of Inquest as follows:

On 3 December 2023, Margaret Kathleen Rodgers had a fall at her home in Warlingham Surrey. She was taken to hospital the same day and found to have sustained rib fractures and spinal fracture and was admitted to East Surrey Hospital. Mrs Rodgers developed hospital acquired pneumonia during her admission for which she was treated. On 14 December 2023 she was found to have an unstageable or advanced sacral pressure ulcer, its development and progress had not been identified until that point. As a result Mrs Rogers required two surgical procedures, on 21 December and 27 December 2023, under general anaesthetic to treat the infected ulcer. Whilst in hospital Mrs Rodgers developed a urinary tract infection and this together with preadmission aortic stenosis and cardiac failure led to her death from congestive cardiac failure on 12 January 2024 at East Surrey Hospital Redhill. Both Mrs Rodgers trauma injuries which resulted in immobility adding to her risk of pneumonia and the development in hospital of the advanced sacral ulcer which required surgery more than minimally contributed to her death in that they impacted on her physical reserves which were already undermined by her existing heart failure and frailty.","A narrative conclusion was recorded at Box 4 of the Record of Inquest as follows: On 3 December 2023, Margaret Kathleen Rodgers had a fall at her home in Warlingham Surrey.

NICE and the National Wound Care Strategy guidance is that patients admitted to hospital have a pressure ulcer risk assessment within 6 hours of admission. This means that the first assessment will often need to be undertaken in the Emergency Department (ED). The court heard that the work to ensure that the ED completes such assessments is ongoing and not yet embedded and that there are practical difficulties, for example when ED patients were located on corridors. b. The court also heard that in December 2023 to January 2024, the period of Mrs Rodgers admission, the hospital was experiencing a high level of operational pressures and that on occasions the ward itself had insufficient nursing staff levels to meet the demand of acutely ill patients with high dependency needs. The Trust is undertaking a review of the staffing template for the ward, but that work is not complete and not yet incorporated into the budget. The coroner is concerned that in not completing the above recommendations arising out of the patient safety review, the Trust is placing patients at risk of early death. 7",68,N/A: Not found

He indicated that he was alone in his home, that he was having chest pains and having difficulty breathing. He remained on the call to the ambulance service during which time his condition worsened, his breathing deteriorated, and he started vomiting. The call was ended at 2010 hours. An ambulance arrived at 0017 hours on 20/2/24. By the time the crew attended, Mr Tyler could not be revived, and his death was confirmed by paramedics at 0110 hours on 20/2/2024.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: - In evidence I found that the call handlers had been following the correct algorithm as dictated by the nationally adopted Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS), and that he was appropriately categorised as requiring an Amber 1 ambulance. However, it would also have been clear to any clinician that he was deteriorating and was in the process of having a cardiac event. Mr Tyler was on his own and could not inform the ambulance service if his condition deteriorated. Despite Mr Tyler being alone and being in extremis, the MPDS Code was maintained at Amber 1.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 July 2024. The jury made a natural causes conclusion supported by a narrative, which I attach. I drafted this report in early October 2024. However, it was not issued at that time owing to an IT error.","Mr Bainborough lived in supported living accommodation. He had a history of schizophrenia and substance misuse but had been discharged from mental health services in 2022 due to poor engagement. Mr Bainborough was not taking anti-psychotic medication and did not engage with his GP. Mr Bainborough's mental health problems contributed to him being visibly underweight. Attempts were made to assess Mr Bainborough's physical and mental health, but Mr Bainborough refused to engage. Following a failed attempt to informally assess Mr Bainborough under the Mental Health Act on 5 June 2023, it was decided to apply for a warrant under Section 135(1) Mental Health Act so that Mr Bainborough could be detained to enable an assessment to take place. There were significant delays in applying for a warrant for reasons specific to the circumstances of this case. An application for a warrant was submitted to the Magistrates Court on 18 August 2023 and the warrant was granted at a hearing on 23 August. Once a warrant was issued, an appointment was made for police officers to execute the warrant on 7 September 2023. Before the warrant could be executed, Mr Bainborough was admitted to hospital on 29 August 2023 suffering from malnutrition. He had a BMI of around 13. He was detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. The plan was for him to receive physical and mental health treatment in an acute hospital setting until he was physically well enough to be transferred to a psychiatric unit. Mr Bainborough died on 11 September 2023. The medical cause of his death was: 1a) community acquired pneumonia and malnutrition; 1b) anorexia and chronic schizophrenia; 2) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Jury found that the delay in applying for a warrant may have affected the outcome for Mr Bainborough.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) During the Inquest, evidence was heard from 2 consultant psychiatrists and an Approved Mental Health Act Professional (AMHP) regarding the timescales for applying for and executing s135(1) warrants. All of them had concerns about the time taken for a warrant to be issued and executed (2) The warrant application was submitted to the Magistrates Court on 18 August 2023, the hearing took place on 23 August and it was intended that the warrant would be executed on 7 September 2023. This was a timescale of 20 days. The jury was told that this timescale was typical of the time taken to apply for and execute a s135(1) warrant in the experience of the professionals giving evidence at the Inquest. (3) Applications for a warrant are heard at Westminster and Uxbridge Magistrates Courts which consider applications from all 32 London Boroughs. There are a limited number of video hearing slots, so AMPH teams may have to wait several days for a hearing. (4) Once a warrant has been issued, an appointment then needs to be arranged for police officers to execute the warrant. The evidence before the court was that it would generally take in the region of 10 days for an appointment to be scheduled. (5) There is no official fast track procedure. Consequently, there is a risk of harm to the individual and others during the time taken for a warrant to be granted and executed. 3 (6) As individuals have been identified as requiring assessment under the Mental Health Act, the risk of potential harm is recognised. In the absence of treatment, there is an ongoing risk that individuals will harm themselves or others before the warrant can be executed. This includes a risk of fatal harm. 6",52,N/A: Not found

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 August 2024. The jury returned a suicide conclusion supported by a narrative, which I attach. I drafted this report in early October 2024. However, it was not issued at that time owing to an IT error.","Mrs Mohamed developed mental health problems after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014. In early 2022, she was suicidal and was detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act in March 2022. She was released from hospital the following month and went to visit family abroad. On returning to the UK in July 2022, she was irrational and paranoid and her children's social worker referred her back to mental health services. Mrs Mohamed was again detained under section 2 MHA on 21 September 2022. Mrs Mohamed's full mental health history was not easily available due to a cyber-attack. On 30 September 2022 Mrs Mohamed was sent on home leave for a week pursuant to Section 17 Mental Health Act. On the evening of 3 October 2022, Mrs Mohamed made a succession of distressed telephone calls to her children's social worker. On 4 October, she sent text messages to her children's social worker threatening to kill her children and expressing the need to return to hospital. Attempts were made to persuade Mrs Mohamed to return to hospital voluntarily but she refused. Over the following days, she expressed suicidal thoughts and threatened to jump from the balcony outside her 5 th floor flat to professionals. The community mental health team was of the view that Mrs Mohammed needed to return to hospital. However, the ward did not apply for a warrant under s135(2) Mental Health Act to return her to hospital and instead asked the community mental health team to persuade her to return to hospital voluntarily. On 12 October 2022, Mrs Mohamed jumped from the balcony. Her death was confirmed at the scene. The medical cause of her death was 1a) Multiple severe traumatic injuries 2) excessive Mirtazapine intake. At the time of her death, the ward had not applied for a warrant to return her to hospital under s135(2) Mental Health Act.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) It was accepted that a s135(2) warrant should have been applied for on 4 October 2022. However, if an application had been submitted to the magistrates' court that day, it is unlikely that the warrant would have been executed before Mrs Mohamed's death. In evidence, I was informed by a number of mental health professionals that the time taken for a s135(2) warrant to be obtained from the magistrates' court and executed by the police was in the region of 2 weeks. (2) The process for obtaining a warrant is that an application has to be made for a video hearing at either Uxbridge or Westminster Magistrates' Courts. It could take several days for a hearing to be arranged as the courts consider applications from all 32 London Boroughs. Once the Magistrates issued a warrant, an appointment would then be arranged for the police to execute the warrant. (3) I was informed that a 2-week timescale for obtaining s135(2) warrants was still the case in the summer of 2024. (4) I also heard evidence that the mental health team could attend Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in person to apply for a warrant in urgent cases but that they were actively discouraged from using this process by the court. (5) The court heard that the process and timescale for issuing and executing warrants had led to the hospital team adopting a practice of asking the community team to encourage a patient to return to hospital voluntarily before making an application for a warrant. (6) There is an ongoing risk that patients will harm themselves or others in the period before the warrant can be executed. This includes a risk of fatal harm. 3 6",53,N/A: Not found
