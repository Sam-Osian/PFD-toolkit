Calderdale Council 1,"On 19 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacob Lee Shorter, 19 years old. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 June 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a multiple injuries including complete disruption of the torso and skull fracture. .","Jacob was in long term foster care. Following his 18th birthday he was under the pathways leaving care team. He was subject to an education, health and care plan and was still receiving support from William Henry Smith School and received therapy sessions from them. He was seen by a pathways advisor and had an independent visitor in place. In May and June 2023 professionals meetings concerns were expressed about his low mood and he was encouraged to attend his GP with his foster carer. The GP report confirms there was no low moods or anxiety reports apart from the 24 November 2023 appointment that he attended with his foster carer where treatment was discussed and he wanted to think about his options. His foster carer contacted the local authority in September 2023 after he had told her his feelings had gone downhill and she was not given any strategies to help him. The independent visitor discussed his wellbeing with him on 3 December 2023 where he said he had felt suicidal in the past but did not currently feel this way. This information was not passed on to his foster carer or to the pathways team. He was seen again on 31 December 2023 where he was reported to be doing well and no concerns were raised about his emotional wellbeing. On new years day Jacob left home and mentioned about having choices to his foster carer. He did not say where he was going and did not return home. On 1 January 2024 Jacob made his way onto the train tracks at Heeley Loop in Sheffield. He was seen on the track in the four foot area. [REDACTED] It was dark and raining heavily that evening. The train driver applied the emergency brake. Jacob made no attempt to move. There was no time to sound the horn. Unfortunately the train was unable to stop in time and impacted with Jacob causing fatal injuries. Investigations were undertaken that could not establish how Jacob had accessed the train lines. In that area I heard there is more than standard security, with fences and walls. There is pedestrian access and vehicle access gates, but these were locked and everything was in order.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Whilst the Independent Visitor was made aware of previous suicidal ideation this was not passed on to the foster carer or anyone else. Calderdale were unable to tell me of the training they receive or the escalation route for concerns or disclosures of this type. There is a clear risk that if this type of information is not passed on and adequate training is not provided in terms of metal health then this could cause future deaths. 6

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,The circumstances of the death are as follows : Eifion Wyn Huws was aged 63 at the time of his death on 10 June 2022. He had a past medical history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having had the diagnosis on 12 January 2022 and poorer mental health as a result. Other than the lymphoma he had no other significant past medical history. The anticipation of awaiting scans and treatment impacted severely upon his mental health but he had significant family support. Eifion was regularly reviewed by a GP and medicated accordingly. He had previous attempts at self-harm by way of medication overdose or self-inflicted injury. He had been under the care of the Community Mental Health Team including Home Treatment Team and primary care since early 2022 up to his death. His acts of self-harm were impulsive but serious. On 10 June 2022 Eifion had left his home address to attend his daughter's home across the road to let the cat out. There was a concern for Eifion when he did not reply to a text message from his wife around 15 mins later who then attended at their daughter's home and on opening the front door found Eifion suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion's GP had made a 'very urgent' referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation (SPOAA) on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this 'very urgent' referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients. b. During the evidence it was accepted that 'a' above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board's investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement. 2. An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion's death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner. Coroner's Office, County Hall, Wynnstay Road, Ruthin, LL15 1YN |"

The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not been heard.,"Mary Jones was found dead at her home address on 7 November 2023. She had last been spoken to on 6 November. She died as a result of a deliberate overdose of medication, taken with the intent to end her own life. As part of calculating what a fatal dose would be, she consulted a well known book advising on suicide methods.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The “well known suicide book” I refer to in Box 3 is ” (redact on publication). As part of my investigations, I have received evidence that this book is readily available on Amazon.co.uk following a simple search for the same. Furthermore, it is available on Amazon Prime – so is available for expedited delivery. It is the first item shown when a search is made. Amazon, or the algorithms, are clearly aware of the potential for harm that this book can cause as there is a banner at the top giving contact numbers for the Samaritans. Despite this, the book is still on sale. I am aware that the Area Coroner for Cheshire wrote to Amazon in December 2023 raising this same issue, but has not yet had a response. I am concerned that the ready availability of this book will lead to people being more effective in any attempts to take their own lives. 6"

The Chief Executive of NHS Dorset 1,"On the 4 th April 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Emma Victoria Sanders, aged 34 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 18 th November 2024. The medical cause of death was: Ia Hypoxic Brain Encephalopathy Ib Asphyxia The conclusion of the Inquest was a narrative conclusion that Emma Victoria Sanders died as a consequence of the self-application of a ligature to her neck, in circumstances where her intention remains unclear.","Emma had a complex mental health history with confirmed diagnoses of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and was known to regularly self harm by a variety of means. Emma had a history of opiate dependence and on the 22nd February 2023, she began a period in a detoxification and rehabilitation placement in Cornwall in order to become abstinent from methadone so she could progress to therapy treatment for her mental health diagnoses. Prior to this she had experienced a period of relative stability with her mental health. During this placement the methadone prescription was reduced more quickly than she had experienced before, and she became emotionally dysregulated. Her mental health deteriorated, and her acts of self harm increased as a result of which she was taken to the local hospital in Cornwall. The placement was ended on the 7th March as it was felt her risks were too high to be managed in that setting. On the 14th March 2023 Emma was taken to the Emergency Department at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth after she disclosed that she had taken an overdose of her prescribed medication. At this time the hospital was experiencing extreme capacity pressures and Emma was placed in the cohorting corridor which was being staffed by paramedics due to the capacity pressures. At 18.58 hours, when for a very short period of time there were no staff in the corridor, Emma can be seen on the CCTV of the corridor to secret upon her person a nasal canula with plastic tubing from an equipment trolley. At 19.53 hours Emma went to the toilet in the Emergency Department. At 20.03 hours, Emma was found in a collapsed and unresponsive condition on the floor of the toilet with a ligature fashioned from nasal canula tubing around her neck. Following attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation there was a return of spontaneous circulation, and she was admitted to the critical care unit at the hospital where she continued to receive care, however her condition deteriorated, and she died on the 19th March 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. At the time of her death Emma had a Frequent Attender Care plan, or as they are now known a High Intensity Use Care Plan, in place. This plan was agreed by representatives from Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (DHUFT) who provide the mental health care across Dorset, a representative from the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, a representative from Poole Hospital and a representative from We Are With You (WAWY) who supported Emma with her substance misuse. The aims of this plan for Emma were: • to provide a consistent approach when Emma presented to the emergency department • to streamline her care so that she does not have to wait any longer than necessary in the ED as she has identified this makes her feel worse • to minimise the impact on emergency department resources when Emma attends • to reduce the use of restrictive interventions which may exacerbate Emma's distress ii. South West Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWAST), who provide the paramedic care in the South West, were not provided with the plan prior to the 14th March 2023, nor were other hospitals Emma may present to, such as the other local hospital in Dorset, Dorset County Hospital, or the hospital in 3 Cornwall where Emma was taken to when she self harmed on the 5th March 2023 during her time at the detoxification and rehabilitation placement. iii. On the 14th March 2023, due to the capacity issues the cohorting area was opened at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital and representatives from SWAST were caring for the patients in the cohorting area. When Emma arrived at the hospital, she was taken to the cohorting area and was booked into the hospital by the triage nurse from the hospital, although was not seen by them and her previous records were not accessed. iv. There can be a delay in accessing the hospital patient record when a patient arrives at the hospital as following the booking in process, there needs to be a merger of the ambulance paperwork to verify they have the correct person before the hospital patient record can be accessed. The process adopted by different hospitals may cause a delay in access to the hospital patient record and evidence was given that at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital this could be anything up to 10 minutes from experience. v. When Emma arrived at the hospital she was booked in by the triage nurse between 18.49 and 18.52 hours, however the merger of her records did not happen until 18.59 hours. No representative from the hospital saw Emma prior to her death and she was monitored by the SWAST paramedics in the cohorting area, so there was no access to her patient record which detailed her significant history of self harm and the Frequent Attender Care Plan. The Frequent Attender Care Plan was not followed throughout the 1 hour and 47 minutes Emma was with professionals from when SWAST attended her home address until the time she was last seen prior to her death. Had it been accessed, and followed, there would have been opportunities to discuss with Emma further support for her whilst she was at the hospital and the evidence given by the witnesses who had contact with her that day was that they would have considered managing her care differently. vi. University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust, of which the Royal Bournemouth Hospital forms part, have taken action internally to ensure that a person's records are now available when a person arrives at the hospital and this would include access to Frequent Attender Care Plans, however evidence was given that a similar process around the merger of records is undertaken at other hospitals across the South West, from the experience of SWAST, and this may also be a national issue. vii. The Summary Care Record (SCR) is accessible to a variety of healthcare professionals and accessible to SWAST. 4 viii. As per the NHS England website, link found here Summary Care Record - NHS England Digital, “The Summary Care Record (SCR) is a national database that holds electronic records of important patient information such as current medication, allergies and details of any previous bad reactions to medicines, created from GP medical records. It can be seen and used by authorised staff in other areas of the health and care system involved in the patient's direct care”. ix. Documents cannot be uploaded to the SCR, however a section can be added to the SCR to detail information such as care plans. Evidence was given that the content of the SCR is controlled by the specific Integrated Care Boards (ICB) covering that area. There are 42 ICBs across England and Wales. x. The SCR for Dorset does not include a section to detail the care plans in place for individuals. The Deputy Director for Care for SWAST gave evidence that none of the ICBs in the South West Region has a section in the SCR to detail care plans in place for individuals. IF there were such a section, the GP of the individual would then be responsible for uploading the details to the SCR and then it would be accessible to other health professionals the person comes into contact with nationally. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. There can be a delay in accessing a patient's hospital record and history when they are taken to hospital by a paramedic depending on the method of booking in and triage which could impact on patient care, especially if there are delays in them being assessed such as when they are placed in cohorting areas, and this could lead to a future death. ii. The Summary Care Record does not detail care plans in place for individuals in Dorset, the wider South West region and may be nationally. Lack of access to these plans could impact on patient care and lead to a future death. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 23 July 2024. The conclusion was that Danny Anderson died as a result of suicide, contributed to by neglect.","Danny Anderson suffered from chronic mental health difficulties, which first developed around the age of 15. His past psychiatric history included serious incidents of self-harm and necessary admissions to hospital under the provisions of the Mental Health Act. In 2022, Danny required a six-week admission to hospital in February/March 2022, due to paranoid and delusional beliefs. In June 2022, Danny again required admission under the Mental Health Act for paranoid and delusional beliefs. He received care and assessment in hospital under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. He received a number of possible diagnoses during the course of the admission. Evidence is accepted from an independent psychiatric expert, that Danny was likely to have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in 2022. This is based upon his presenting condition, requiring the admissions to hospital, and based upon his presentation throughout the six-month period in hospital – June to December 2022. Danny's condition was not correctly diagnosed before discharge from hospital. Danny was entitled to Section 117 after-care but no significant attention was given to his Section 117 after-care needs. Danny should have been assessed for supported accommodation. This was not done and supported accommodation was not sought for him. Danny was discharged to grossly inadequate hotel accommodation. Danny was discharged from hospital on the 14 December 2022. There was no comprehensive assessment of risk prior to discharge. There was no comprehensive safety plan put into place for him. Danny had stated his intention to stop his anti-psychotic medication before he was discharged from hospital, but no plan was put in place to address the clear risks of non-compliance with medication. The community mental health team did not communicate to the housing team, the importance of Danny being placed within the area of the community mental health team. Danny was placed out of area and was not seen face to face by his care co-ordinator before his discharge from the community team. Telephone contacts between Danny and his care co-ordinator raised significant concerns about Danny's mental health and living circumstances. Despite this, he was discharged from the community mental health team following telephone contact on the 18 January 2023. No communication was sent to Danny's GP to inform them of the discharge from mental health services. On the 30 March 2023, Danny was found hanging inside his room at [REDACTED] . Paramedics attended and pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. Danny took his own life, whilst suffering from a mental illness, and whilst receiving absolutely no care from the mental health services. Danny's death was contributed to by cumulative failures, amounting to a gross failure, to provide mental health care to him","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: There was no evidence of any adequate formulation of risk prior to Danny's discharge from hospital on the 14 December 2022 and no evidence of any adequate risk formulation prior to Danny's discharge from the community mental health team in January 2023. The statement “Danny does not present with any suicidal ideation or self-harming behaviour“ was copied and pasted multiple times throughout the risk assessment template on the 14 December 2022. There was no analysis or formulation of risk for 3 Danny. From review of the records throughout the admission, I am concerned that there was an over-reliance upon Danny's answer to questions posed about suicidal ideation and intent. At the point of discharge, there was no evidence of information gathering around Danny's mental state, behaviour, psychiatric history, history of abuse, social situation – and evidence that this information was used to form a judgment about the likelihood or probability of an adverse or harmful outcome (in accordance with the Trust's risk policy). There was no evidence of any consideration of Danny's historical factors and experiences, more recent problems and existing strengths and resources (in accordance with the NICE guidelines 2022). Witnesses from consultant level to care co-ordinator level, were unable to describe a robust risk assessment process. I am concerned that staff do not fully understand how to assess and manage risk. There was no safety plan on discharge from hospital, or prior to discharge from the community team, to address the clear risks that Danny posed. 6"

NHS England, Prison Healthcare Commissioners for HMP Lowdham Grange ('NHSE') 3. , Managing Director for Justice and Immigration Services, Serco 4. , Justice Director, Sodexo 5. , Chief Executive, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 1","On 5 April 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Anthony Binfield, David William Richards and Rolandas Karbauskas. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, heard before a jury, calling evidence on dates between 4 November 2024 and 7 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Anthony, David and Rolandas had all died as a result of self-inflicted ligature asphyxiation, while in state detention at HMP Lowdham Grange, within a 19-day period of one another. The jury found multiple failings and missed opportunities in their care had probably more than minimally contributed to their deaths.","Serco had operated HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire, for 25 years under the provisions of a Private Finance Initiative ('PFI'). When the PFI expired on 15 February 2023, the Ministry of Justice awarded the prison operator contract to Sodexo. This was the first private provider to private provider prison transfer to take place in England and Wales. To facilitate the contract exit and transfer, Serco, Sodexo and HMPPS each established their own mobilisation and transfer team to oversee the project between August 2022 and February 2023. Sodexo assumed operational control of the prison on 16 February 2023. On 6 March 2023, Anthony Binfield was declared deceased inside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was the result of suicide. On 13 March 2023, David William Richards was declared deceased outside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was accidental. On 25 March 2023, Rolandas Karbauskas was declared deceased outside his cell, having died as a result of using a ligature. His death was the result of suicide. All three men had vulnerabilities and had been in contact with prison and healthcare staff concerning these vulnerabilities in the period shortly before their deaths. There were multiple missed opportunities to have considered the risk pertinent information held within various systems and records when engaging with all three men. The jury found that there were shortcomings in the culture and systems with regards to prison and healthcare services, which contributed to the three self-inflicted deaths. Further, the jury found that the way in which the mobilisation and transfer of the prison contract had been conducted, probably more than minimally contributed to the deaths.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Matters of Operational Concern While the evidence called at inquest relates to HMP Lowdham Grange, these issues are likely to be relevant across the prison estate, and for that reason I highlight my concerns to both the Minister for Prisons and NHS England as commissioners for prison healthcare. 1. Recruitment, retention and training of prison and healthcare staff (response required by the Minister for Prisons and NHSE) Staffing levels I heard compelling evidence from prison and healthcare staff who told me they were overwhelmed, over- burdened and under-supported in their work at HMP Lowdham Grange. I understand from both prison providers (Serco and Sodexo) and the Healthcare Trust (Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust), that recruitment and retention of staff was a persistent challenge, meaning more often than not the staff on shift were required to cover more than their fair workload. This led to low staff morale, higher levels of sickness absence, and an inevitable deterioration in prisoner safety. The inadequate prison and healthcare staffing levels led to a restricted regime and healthcare provision. The prison was unable to offer keywork to all men, and the mental health team could no longer offer a named nurse service. Both of these aspects of care are fundamental to supporting the most vulnerable prisoners. For months prior to the deaths, the Trust failed to fulfil its commissioned obligations to provide a nurse during night state. Prison staff have only basic first aid training and lacked the expertise of a medical professional when attempting to provide CPR to Anthony. Skill mix and experience I am concerned by the failure to retain experienced prison officers and healthcare staff. The private prison operator and the Authority were focused on the number of staff, rather than the skills set or experience of the staffing body as a whole. One PCO told me that he was considered the most senior on shift in the houseblock with less than 2 years' experience of working as a prison officer. The healthcare team had worked for a protracted period with no permanent Head of Service in post. Without a sufficient number of experienced staff, the prison had lost organisational memory, allowing poor custom and practice to become the norm amongst inexperienced and overwhelmed staff. Training All of the prison staff had completed the ITC programme, and yet there was widespread evidence of failures to do the basics. Staff failed to ensure the welfare of prisoners at roll count, failed to challenge flagrant breaches of prison rules such as passing items under cell doors, and did not know how to properly deal with obscured cell observation hatches. This calls into question the adequacy of their basic training, and the system for supervision and mentoring during the early years of practice. Healthcare staff were often not included in the same training as prison staff, and where agency staff were used to fill vacancies, they were not part of Trust training. Again, this led to poor custom and practice such as failing to read medical records before reviewing the mental health and wellbeing of the prisoners. Accepting there is a complex interplay between staffing numbers, experience and quality of training, I highlight to you my concern that continued understaffing of prison and healthcare teams will undoubtedly contribute to future deaths in custody. 2. A complete failure to identify and share risk pertinent information between prison and healthcare staff, and within those teams (response required from the Minister for Prisons, NHSE, Serco, Sodexo and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust) The staff remaining at the prison in March 2023 were, by their own admission, firefighting what was in front of them, rather than working in a collaborative and holistic way to better serve prisoner safety. There was a complete breakdown in the system of risk identification and information sharing. Prison and healthcare staff did not routinely consider information captured within the electronic systems, nor did they update the systems with risk pertinent information gathered during interactions with the prisoners. The prison records (the core file and P-NOMIS) and healthcare records (systemone) are a valuable source of risk pertinent information, that will enable prison and healthcare staff to comply with the mandatory requirement of PSI 64/2011 “All staff who have contact with prisoners must be aware of the triggers that may increase the risk of suicide, self-harm or violence, and take appropriate action.” Many prison and healthcare witnesses believed there was no working system in place at HMP Lowdham Grange to allow them to identify and share risk pertinent information. As a result, operational decisions were made in silo, and interactions with Anthony, David and Rolandas, were conducted without due consideration of their risk pertinent information. This causes concern from both a training and policy perspective. It would be impossible for prison and healthcare staff to remember the triggers for each and every prisoner in their care. Therefore, the system in place needs to make it as easy as possible for staff to quickly and readily understand the risk that exits for the prisoner and what might trigger that risk to materialise in any given circumstance. In this case, as in previous deaths, there was excessive focus on the prisoner's current presentation (i.e. the absence of saying they were going to harm themselves) without any understanding of their previous self-harm and suicidality. Specific missed opportunities included:  a failure by prison and healthcare staff to read the incoming prisoner's core file. This hard copy file contains valuable information such as previous ACCT documents and SASH warning forms, yet instead of reviewing this material and pulling out key triggers for past self-harm and suicidality and recording the same on P-NOMIS and/or systemone, the files were sent straight to storage. This is despite the fact that a background history of deliberate self-harm is an evidence- based risk factor for suicide as set out in PSI 64/2011  Healthcare staff concluding on Friday 3 March 2023 that Anthony's inability to attend a candle lighting service might be a trigger for self-harm, but such was not communicated to prison staff or safer custody or recorded on any prison systems  David's PNOMIS file clearly indicated his fear of joining the general prison population led to him requiring VP status in his previous establishment. However, the officers who sought to move him from the induction wing had not read his notes nor were they aware of the content of his previous ACCTs. HMPPS, prison and healthcare providers need to carefully scrutinise the system for identifying risk pertinent information to ensure that the staff on the ground know how and when to access that information to support timely risk assessment when engaging with prisoners. This is especially important in the early days in custody setting, but not exclusively so. I am also concerned by the use of email to convey risk pertinent information. In this case, prison staff communicated their concerns about Anthony's mental health to individual nursing Sodexo email inboxes, which the nurses were not expected to regularly access. The use of email means that such concerns are not accessible to other members of staff as they would be if they were recorded in PNOMIS or Systemone. Again, this needs to be addressed in policy and re-enforced in training. Staff told me that while the PSI mandates they should be aware of risks and triggers, there was no clearly documented system setting out how and when this should occur. 3. The system for transfer of prisoners between establishments is disorganised and unsafe (Minister for Prisons) I heard evidence in the course of exploring David's death, that he was transferred from the vulnerable prisoner unit ('VPU') at HMP Chelmsford to HMP Lowdham Grange, a prison which did not offer a VPU. David had been afforded VP status as a result of publicity about his business affairs and the nature of the offence that had resulted in his incarceration. He was scared that he might be targeted for violence and/or extorsion by fellow prisoners on account of this. David had been on 4 open ACCTs at HMP Chelmsford and had told his ACCT case co-ordinator that he was fearful of losing his VP status on transfer. While the Prison Director said he would have expected both HMP Chelmsford and HMP Lowdham Grange to have spoken about this risk in advance of the transfer, there is no evidence that any individual fully explored this potential trigger, and David was not informed that his VP status was being rescinded on leaving HMP Chelmsford. Between 20 October 2021 and 10 January 2022, Anthony made 17 applications to transfer to another prison because he did not feel safe at HMP Lowdham Grange. There were numerous intelligence reports to substantiate that Anthony was at risk of harm from others, and that, on occasion, he had been assaulted. Anthony's applications were dealt with in a haphazard manner. He did not receive a formal answer to his transfer request and had to chase many times for updates. This left Anthony feeling frustrated. I heard evidence that there is no formal policy framework or system for managing the progress of prison- to-prison transfers, including a lack of expected response times or formal escalation plan if a prison fails to provide any response. Notwithstanding the pressures on prison population management, it was agreed that the system for administering such applications should be co-ordinated and predictable, regardless of the success or otherwise of the application, rather than leading to prisoner frustration in waiting for answers that never come. 4. Failure to reduce isolation of Foreign National Prisoners (Minister for Prisons) Prison can be an isolating experience for any prisoner, but especially so for one who does not speak English. I heard evidence that the Big Word translation service did not work on multiple occasions across multiple sites within the prison. Staff gave evidence that even when the system did connect, they could be waiting in a queue for up to an hour to access an appropriate interpreter. There was no plan to seek to reduce Rolandas' obvious isolation, and seemingly no provision for expediting his induction so that he could be housed with fellow Lithuanian speakers. I have seen no evidence of a national or local plan to support Foreign National Prisoners. There is a clear risk of future self-inflicted deaths if language barriers and isolation are not adequately addressed. 5. Drugs (Minister for Prisons) HMP Lowdham Grange, like many establishments, continues to face challenges related to novel psychoactive substance misuse. There is no requirement for prisons to have an NPS specific drug policy and I am concerned that generic drug reduction strategies are ineffective against this particular threat. NPS is highly dangerous and carries a risk of death. I am concerned that more young men will die in custody as a result of NPS use. Matters relating to the transfer of the prison contract 6. The process of transferring the prison from one private provider to another, lacked sufficient scrutiny of the safety of the prison before, during and after the contract exit/transfer process (Minister for Prisons) Safety was not front and centre of the Mobilisation and Transfer project. I heard evidence from the HMPPS witnesses that there was a willingness to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. However, I invite a formal response detailing exactly what action has been taken or is proposed, as it is likely that further transfers shall occur across departments when PFIs expire, or contracts change provider. Matters relating to learning from deaths in custody 7. Persistent Failure to learn from deaths over many years (Serco Justice Director, Minister for Prisons) Embedding learning from deaths I heard evidence that many of the contributory factors leading to the deaths of Anthony, David and Rolandas, had been raised as issues in the investigations following previous deaths in custody at HMP Lowdham Grange. While Serco no longer manage HMP Lowdham Grange, they continue to manage prisons, and there is a risk of future deaths if the organisation is unable to create a robust culture of seeking to identify issues early, adopt learning, and continually monitor culture to ensure any action taken is embedded to reduce the risk of future deaths. From a HMPPS perspective, while private prison providers assume the operational risks of running the establishment, the HMPPS Controllers remain responsible for assuring a safe, decent and secure prison. I am concerned that the Controllers at HMP Lowdham Grange did not have a sufficient grasp of the longstanding cultural issues pertaining to safety. This raises the question of the efficacy of the Controller role and exactly how Controllers assure themselves that the provider is learning from deaths. 8. A failure to act with candour when engaging in post-death investigations (Minister for Prisons, Serco, Sodexo) Full, frank and timely disclosure of potentially relevant material to those investigating deaths The quality of any post-death investigation is predicated by the openness, honesty and transparency of the agencies involved. This inquest was beset with disclosure failures by HMPPS. A significant volume of disclosure, running to thousands of pages, was provided to the court towards the end of the hearing despite many months of active case management. HMPPS conduct their business primarily through emails, rather than any case management system, and it took a long time to review and supply this material to the court. HMPPS have no effective system for gathering, retaining, reviewing and disclosing potentially relevant material so that the issues relevant to death can be identified and learning put in place. If the process of learning from deaths is obfuscated by failures in the disclosure process, there is a risk that deaths will occur in the future from matters which could and should have been rectified. Candour The Healthcare Trust are subject to a statutory duty of candour. HMPPS, Serco and Sodexo failed to embrace the same ethos during these investigations. Consequently, there was minimal acceptance of the risk factors set out above, all of which may cause or contribute to deaths in the prison in the future. I have shared my concerns previously with those at HMP Lowdham Grange (PFD report relating to Christopher Howard Smith, dated 7 July 2023). I am troubled that unless there is a radical change in culture, and reflective learning from deaths is prioritised, prisoners will continue to die in custody. It is most concerning that there is a marked discrepancy between the failings that were admitted in oral evidence by the vast majority of witnesses when faced with irrefutable evidence, against the written statements submitted to the coronial investigations which contained very little, if any, reflection and candour. Even after the evidence had been called, the prison organisations did not respond to my request to advance admissions in order to relieve the jury of the burden of making findings on each and every issue. I would like to understand any action proposed by the Minister, Serco and Sodexo to address the issue of candour. 6"

Chief Executive Surrey and Borders Partnership Trust 2. Chair NHS England 1,"On 30 th May 2023 an inquest was opened into the death of Charne Nikita Petit. The inquest was concluded on 30 th July 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1a. Suspension. The narrative conclusion was that: Charne Petit suffered from psychotic delusions which she found extremely distressing. From 2019 to 2022 she was treated by the early intervention in psychosis team. Thereafter her care was transferred to the community mental health team. Her symptoms and mood fluctuated, in addition, on occasions, non- compliance with anti-psychotic medication and use of illicit drugs triggered relapses in her mental health. On the 26th March 2023 she suffered a psychotic breakdown and was assessed under the Mental Health Act and found to meet the requirements for detention under s2. No mental health bed was available. She was nursed one to one in the Royal Surrey County Hospital by nurses from the psychiatric liaison team. She was re-started on aripiprazole and her mood stabilized. She was discharged to the home treatment team on the 31st March 2023 without an assessment followed by medical treatment in a mental health hospital. On the 24th April she was seen by her care coordinator and reported intrusive psychotic delusions and struggling to manage her emotions. On the 25th April 2023 she represented to Royal Surrey County Hospital having abused drugs. She was assessed not to require a mental health assessment and discharged. On the 12th May 2023 she killed herself by suspending herself [REDACTED]. The death was preventable with more effective treatment of her psychosis. The lack of a mental health bed after she was assessed as detainable under s2 more than minimally contributed to the death. She died by Suicide","See the details set out in the narrative conclusion. In addition: Ms Petit was reviewed in hospital on the 29 th March 2023 by a consultant from the liaison psychiatry team. Her presentation had improved since admission and in his opinion, so long as she continued to improve, she could be discharged to the home treatment team and that this was the least restrictive option. The effect of the discharge on the 31 st March 2023 was that Ms Petit was not admitted to a mental health hospital under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and was therefore discharged without having been assessed comprehensively in a mental health hospital.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) Evidence given by the court appointed expert consultant psychiatrist was that Ms Petit was not adequately medicalised and that she needed assessment and medical review with optimisation of treatment in a mental health hospital. Her response to treatment needed to be observed. This is what a s2 admission is designed to effect. The lack of a bed in a mental health hospital denied Ms Petit this opportunity for optimal treatment. (2) The Court heard that owing to a shortage of mental health beds patients who have been assessed by 2 s12 consultant psychiatrists to require detention after a mental health act assessment are being effectively detained in general hospitals without a section, awaiting a bed, because they cannot be placed under section unless a mental health bed is available. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1st December 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased had died from hanging, and the conclusion was suicide.","Katharine Fox was being treated at home following a stay as an in-patient in Broomfield Hospital. Some of that stay had involved the deceased being detained under section 2 Mental Health Act 1983. While being treated in hospital, the deceased obtained psychology treatment in the form of a series of sessions with a trainee psychologist with whom she built a good clinical relationship and from which she reported benefiting significantly. Following her discharge from hospital, this psychology treatment effectively came to an end, since the procedures for receiving this treatment in the community were passed to an entirely separate set of clinicians. There was an entirely separate procedure for referral and provision of psychology sessions, with a very significant wait, and the deceased never in fact secured access to those services in the months between being discharged (in May 2022) and her death in October 2022. I was also told by the witness conducting EPUT's own investigation that the teams use separate notes, and it may not always be possible for those notes to be accessed by other teams. This included evidence that a different computer system is used in the north of the county from in the south.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN] (1) I am concerned that the disconnection between the provision of psychology services to patients in hospital and the provision of similar psychology services to patients in the community, including the fact that the community psychology service does not receive any form of handover and that there is a substantial wait for the provision of psychology sessions which may well require continuity to be delivered effectively. (2) I am concerned about the fact, if that is indeed right, that some clinicians in the 2 psychology service may not be able to access notes made by clinicians in either other hospitals or other parts of the county. I was told that had the deceased actually managed to procure psychology sessions that the new psychologist may not have been able to read the notes of their predecessor if they were on a different computer system. 6"

YES","In answer to the questions “when, where and how did Oliver come by his death?”, the jury recorded as follows: “Oliver Davies committed suicide in his cell at HMP Hewell by hanging. He died on the 31.12.22.”","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1) Oliver had been at HMP Hewell since 20.10.22. He was a man with long- standing mental health issues, for whom this was a first experience of custody. After a steady deterioration in his mental state, a mental health referral on 17.11.22 led to a belated mental health examination conducted by a registered learning disability nurse on 6.12.22. In the week leading up to the nurse's assessment: (a) A prison officer had made an urgent TAG mental health referral on 30.11.22, citing concerns that Oliver was experiencing active thoughts of self-harm or suicide, and that he ( the officer ) had “mild concerns” about intentional self-harm, and there were “definite indicators” of unintentional self-harm; and (b) Oliver himself had submitted a healthcare application form asking to see a doctor, saying that he was “extremely depressed”, his anxiety was “really high” and he was “not coping at all, please help”; These important events were not highlighted on Oliver's SystmOne medical record, and so the nurse conducting the assessment 6.12.22 was not aware of either of these important recent events, and did not take them into account when assessing Oliver; 2) Oliver was allocated a care coordinator on 6.12.12 following the nurse's assessment. An appointment was fixed for Oliver to meet the care coordinator for the first time on 14.12.22. Due to workload pressures, the care coordinator was unable to fulfil that appointment before he went on leave from 16- 28.12.22. Shortly before he went on leave, the care coordinator conducted a “RAG rating” exercise to determine whether he should prioritise seeing Oliver, and determined that Oliver's case merited the lowest priority RAG rating ( green ). When conducting that RAG rating exercise, the care coordinator did not take into account: (a) The prison officer's urgent TAG mental health referral of 30.11.22 ( above ); and (b) A further TAG mental health referral made by a prison paramedic which cited “mild concerns” about both deliberate and unintentional self-harm on Oliver's part, the details of which had been entered onto Oliver's SystmOne medical record. In addition, the care coordinator did not raise in the mental health team's daily forum.the fact that he was unlikely to have time to see Oliver before he went on leave. Had the care coordinator taken into account the referrals at (a)-(b) above, and raised at the daily forum his difficulty in being able to see Oliver, it may well have been that Oliver's case would have merited a more urgent response from the care coordinator or someone else in his stead. 4 Having heard evidence at the inquest from your Trust's Clinical Director, , I was not satisfied that the Trust has fully recognized the above shortcomings, and taken action to ensure that they are not repeated for other mental health patients in custody at HMP Hewell. 6"

Medical Director South West London & St George's Mental Health NHS Trust Trinity Building Springfield University Hospital 15 Springfield Drive London SW17 0YF 1,"On 17 May 2023, one of my assistant coroners, Edwin Buckett, commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Hindes, aged 26 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 October 2023. I made a narrative determination, which I attach.","Michael Hindes killed himself [REDACTED]. One week before he died, he called 999 because he felt suicidal. This was late in the evening on Monday, 8 May. Police attended and took him to St George's Hospital, where he underwent a half hour mental health assessment, after which he was discharged in the early hours.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. When Michael was taken to St George's Hospital, he explained that he had been back and forth from the railway station, each He was discharged with a plan for follow up by the community mental health team (CMHT). I was told that the local CMHT meets at the beginning of every week, and then there is sometimes a delay before an appointment is made, so it was likely that Michael would have to wait an absolute minimum of a week to be seen. In the meantime, it was not thought necessary to refer him to the crisis team. Michael's family knew nothing of his mental ill health. He declined an invitation by the nurse assessing him to contact them. He did not want to worry them. Despite her awareness of the multiple therapeutic benefits of the input of a patient's loved ones, the assessing nurse did not in any way try to persuade Michael to allow her to do this. The first that Michael's family heard of Michael's mental ill health was when they heard of his death. I am sure that, had they been made aware of it while he was still alive, they would have done everything in their power to support him and to engage with the mental health services. Families very often complain to me at inquest that mental health services have not done enough to try to bring them in to a patient's care. In spite of the frequency of this occurrence, the lesson does not seem to be being learnt. When you respond to this letter, I should be grateful to know not just what you have done to address the issue in your own trust, but also what you have done to raise national awareness. 6"

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The medical record documentation for Mr Agius had significant omissions that included an incomplete risk assessment in February 2022 for Mr Agius following his transfer following crisis intervention with the Home Treat Team to avoid an admission to hospital when Mr Agius attempted to take his own life. 2 2. The evidence of assessments of Mr Agius's mental state provided to the inquest indicated a difference of opinion as to whether Mr Agius was displaying hypermanic symptoms on 12 and 13 February 2022. 3. Evidence was heard that there is new national training for assessing risk for patients with mental health concerns but there was no evidence that the Trust has implemented this training. 6

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5th March 2025. The medical cause of death was: 1a Hanging The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: Jean Pike was a vulnerable women aged 54 at the time of death and had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and suffered from a depressive illness. Jean resided in supported accommodation and was under secondary mental health care. In the three months prior to her death Jean's mental health deteriorated and she engaged in serious self-harm to manage her suicidal thoughts. At this time all those involved with Jean knew she was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was expressing an intention to hang herself and was impulsive. Jean had two hospital admissions in the three weeks before her death and during this time support staff at Jean's accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator were clearly communicating to the acute hospital where Jean was admitted on both occasions that they could not keep Jean safe in the community in her supported accommodation and that they were concerned that Jean was going to hang herself. Seven days before Jean's death a decision was taken by a consultant psychiatrist to discharge Jean from hospital nine hours after she had been admitted and at time when Jean was still actively experiencing suicidal thoughts. This decision was taken without any consultation with the professionals involved with Jean and there was no risk assessment of Jean's risk of suicide undertaken by the consultant before Jean was discharged. I find that these actions including the decision to discharge Jean from hospital constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. On the day of her death Jean experienced a 2 mental health crisis at her supported accommodation and was threatening to hang herself. This was known to support staff at Jean's supported accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator but despite this an inadequate safety plan was put in place to safeguard Jean. Jean was left unattended for between 20 – 45 minutes during which time Jean took her own life by hanging. I find that the failure to put in place a robust safety plan and leaving Jean unattended constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. I find that Jean took her own life and that she intended to do so, and that Jean's death was contributed to by neglect. 4",On 18 May 2022 Jean Pike was stating that she was suicidal and intending to hang herself. Jean Pike was left unattended and unobserved for between 20 – 45 minutes. Jean Pike was then found suspended in her supported living accommodation on 18 May 2022 and declared deceased at 14.27.,"During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. I am concerned that Jean was discharged from Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital on two occasions shortly before her death by a consultant psychiatrist and that prior to the decision to discharge on both occasions there was no multi-disciplinary meeting between the consultant on Ward F and the professionals directly involved in caring for Jean in the community about Jean's mental health and the risks she posed to herself in the community. This was in circumstances where the consultant knew before the decisions to discharge that these professionals, which included Jean's care co- ordinator, were clearly stating that they were extremely concerned about Jean's mental health and that they did not consider that they could keep Jean safe in the community and that they thought that Jean would hang herself in the community – which is in fact what happened in this case. I am particularly concerned by the evidence I heard from Jean's care co-ordinator that care co-ordinators are rarely if ever consulted by consultant psychiatrists in Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital before a decision is made to discharge a patient/person under secondary mental health care. This issue was not identified by Swansea University Bay Health Board ('SUBHB') in their internal investigation into Jean's death. This investigation found that “there is evidence of regular and effective communication between support staff, community staff and hospital staff”. The above finding of SUBHB's internal investigation raises a concern that critical lessons have not being identified and learnt by SUBHB from Jean's death about the importance of multi-disciplinary decision making in clinical care and risk management and the importance of including care co-ordinators and professionals in the community before a decision is taken to discharge a patient from Ward F. This creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. I am also concerned that if there is a lack of clarity or a reluctance in Ward F at the consultant level to engage with care co-ordinators and professionals in the community (and before decisions are made to discharge) there is a risk that the concerns of the professionals managing a patient/person under secondary care will not be adequately considered in the decisions made by Ward F 3 clinicians. This also creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. 6"

The investigation concluded on the 29th January 2023 and the conclusion was one of Suicide . The medical cause of death was 1a) Hanging.,"Tobias Mannering-Jones was very vulnerable. He became homeless at the end of December 2022. He had no support network. He generally slept at the Hostel for homeless people in Tameside where he was exposed to abuse due to his sexuality, felt unsafe, and was in the company of people who were significantly greater users of hard drugs. He had mental health issues dating back to his childhood trauma that were greatly exacerbated by his homelessness. He increased his use of drugs to cope with his deteriorating situation, he was also sexually exploited. After he became homeless, he sought help for his spiralling situation. On 6th January he saw the mental health worker attached to his GP practice. Concerns regarding his vulnerability in the homeless accommodation were expressed. He spoke to that worker again on the 9th February at an appointment. His contacts with other agencies in the interim were not known of. He was also seen by Pennine Care Mental Health Liaison after he went to A&E on 15th January, 17th January and 14th February 2023. He indicated thoughts of self-harm with a key issue being his homelessness and the consequential impact on his mental health, drug use and support network exacerbated by the fact he had no telephone or address. He contacted CGL for help on 6th February 2023 to try and obtain help for substance misuse. Attempts to contact him for assessment were unsuccessful given his lack of a telephone. He was under the care of the neighbourhood mental health team and had been offered support from the Big Life Group previously. He was still awaiting assessment for therapy. Contact ceased with them, and they were not involved in planning how his discharges from the acute hospital would be managed in the community. Adult Social Care were contacted, by Tobias, asking for help on 8th February 2023. He was allocated a Social Worker on 14th February. Attempts to contact Tobias were unsuccessful due to his lack of telephone and homelessness. On 21st February 2023 Tobias was found [REDACTED] at Portland Basin Marina. Police found no suspicious circumstances. Post-mortem examination included toxicology. He was found to have evidence of limited cocaine use and alcohol use in the hours prior to his death. He had last been seen alive the afternoon before. No concerns for welfare had been raised following him last being seen. It is probable that had Tobias not been homeless, isolated and vulnerable and had there been a co-ordinated approach to supporting him he would not have taken his own life on 21st February 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest was told that Tobias had sought and had been referred for mental health support however due to the high demand and long waiting lists 2 he was still on a waiting list at the time of his death. The evidence before the inquest was that long delays were still an issue and were not restricted to Tameside but were part of a national picture of delays and long waiting lists for those seeking help with their mental health. 2. The inquest also heard evidence of the impact of homelessness and consequential vulnerability on a young person like Tobias and that the demands on Local Authorities meant that even where vulnerability was recognised there were not resources to offer sustained support and stable housing solutions. The evidence was that as a consequence young vulnerable people had to rely on homeless shelters where they were exposed to additional negative influences and as in Tobias's case abuse due to their sexuality. 3. Evidence was also heard that a person who has to rely on a homeless shelter can then become uncontactable to public service providers as they have no address for contact which means they then have even less chance of accessing support. 4. The inquest was told that young adults who are homeless are often sexually exploited and that those who identify as LGBTQIA can be particularly vulnerable and that the underlying vulnerability and risk was not always appreciated by those dealing with young homeless people and that it could be mistaken by agencies as a lifestyle choice rather than what it actually was, i.e., exploitation by an older adult. 5. The evidence before the inquest was that where multiple agencies were involved it was fundamental that one agency/person took overall ownership/responsibility to ensure a coordinated and effective approach using regular MDTs to understand the information that all agencies had in their possession and to offer effective support. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6th March 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Drug & Alcohol Related. The medical cause of death was; 1a Cardiac Arrhythmia 1b Chronic Excess Alcohol Consumption and Use Of Amphetamine. I found at inquest, Stevyn Carr died on 16th November 2021 at 17 Lytchfeld, Leam Lane, Gateshead from a cardiac arrhythmia caused by the toxic effects of him voluntarily consuming a quality of alcohol and amphetamines at some point prior to his death. His intention in doing so was not to end his life.","Stevyn Carr contacted Northumbria Police on the evening of 15th November 2021 at 7.22pm. His contact with police call handlers and emergency operators was difficult to understand, due to on balance to his intoxication. He did ask for 'Help' and he was told police would attend. The calls to police were assessed a Grade 2 response – normally within an hour. No police attended until they entered Stevyn Carr's address at 12.02pm on 16th November after members of his family contacted the police at 10.38am to express their concerns for him. He was discovered dead when police entered his home. On the evidence heard it was not possible to ascertain whether earlier police attendance would have altered the outcome. From the first call to police to his discovery by police a period of 16 hours 40 minutes elapsed.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The evidence I heard at inquest indicated the level of police response should have been classed as a Grade 2 Vulnerable to ensure a more timely response. (2) No oversight of the incident took place for over 9 hours and at that a comment was made that there were no resources able to attend, but no other options/alternatives were pursued. (3) The family of Stevyn Carr contacted police some 15 hours after the first call to the police and after this a further 1 hour and 23 minutes elapsed before police went to his address and found him. (4) I heard evidence at inquest that a number of incidents were 'delayed' for a significant period for lack of police resources and this position was common place at that time. (5) I have asked for evidence to satisfy me that the position in terms of police attendance has improved both within the area Stevyn Carr died, but across the Northumbria Police force area. The evidence I have received is difficult to interpret and not comprehensive. I am concerned whether the changes to the management of incidents and/or training in relation to the grading of incidents by Northumbria Police has improved since Stevyn Carr's death, to the extent that the timeliness of police response to requests from the public for assistance is improved and is improving. 6"

Chair of the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 2. , Chief Executive at Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 3. , Estates and facilities management consultant/director at Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 1.",On 13 th August 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Henok Zaid GEBRSSLASIE (aged 23 years). The investigation concluded at the end the inquest on 5 th March 2025 at Coventry Coroners Court. The conclusion of the death of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was that death was “suicide and a narrative” a copy of which I attach to this report.,"Mr GEBRSSLASIE on the 2nd August 2021 was arrested by the police having been removed from a bus in possession of a plank of wood and oddly offering the police money sufficient for bus fare, this and his behaviour , throwing a road sign at officers precipitated his detention in police custody which gave rise to a mental health act assessment and his detention at the Caludon Centre. Part of his medical treatment included antipsychotic medication and sedation following an episode of violence. On 5th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE absconded from the Caludon Centre via a window, however he was located at his home address and returned to the Caludon Centre the next day and remained detained (under the Menal Health Act) on the Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, his behaviour leading staff to provide him with rip-proof clothing. There was an issue with language, involved communications achieved with an interpreter. Over the following days, in the context of medications provided, his mood was now adjudged seemingly more stable and by the 12th August 2021 Mr GEBRSSLASIE was allowed his own clothing, rip proof clothing removed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was provide some hospital type pyjamas whist his personal clothing was being washed. Mr GEBRSSLASIE was on level 2 observations (every 15 minutes) and having expression a wish to go home it was communicated to him that his discharge from hospital was an ongoing process and not imminent. On 12th August 2021, the body of Mr GEBRSSLASIE was discovered in his bedroom (Bedroom 2) on Sherbourne Ward nearly 3 hours after his last observation. The deceased had a ligature ([REDACTED]) around his neck and was partially suspended from the bedroom door. The Oxevision system camera (part of a research project, to assess whether new non-contact monitoring technology improves quality of care and safety for patients and staff) in the patients' rooms captured the last interactions Mr GEBRSSLASIE has with staff, where upon moments after the bedroom door closed Mr GEBRSSLASIE then proceeded to use the same bedroom door as an anchor point for the ligature.","During the inquest, the evidence and information revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report them to you. The MATTER(S) OF CONCERN are as follows: i. The inquest explored issues such ligature anchor points. ii. It is known (and has been known for some years by the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust) that the top of a door is a “high risk area” for ligatures in particular patients bedroom which have doors that may be locked by patients from the inside and thereby an unobserved patient area. iii. The circumstances of this inquest touching upon the death of Henok GEBRSSLASIE in August 2021 accentuated this point. iv. Such risks carrying with it a clear risk of death. v. Since the incident it was known that door top alarms is “the way forward” as an environmental change that would mitigate such risk and referred to in a serious investigation report in April 2023, this “way forward” expressed in evidence during the inquest. vi. There remains (now 42 months post Mr GEBRSSLASIEs death) no door top alarms on the patient bedroom doors at Sherbourne Ward, the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, at the Caludon Centre. vii. The cumulative effect (there 'seemingly' no expediency to physically better mitigate this known environmental high-risk issue) is such that a concern as to future deaths exists as of March 2025. 6."

Care Quality Commission 3. NHS England 4. Secretary of State for Health 1,"On 15 th January 2020 an inquest was opened into the death of Mr Paul Timothy Dunne, aged 45, on 02.01.20. On 10th April 2024 I was assigned to investigate this legacy case. The inquest engaged Article 2 ECHR and concluded on 19 h December 2024. The medical cause of death was: 1a Asphyxia. 1b Suspension by neck The conclusion as to his death was recorded as: Mr Dunne committed suicide after absconding from urgent health care in an A&E department. Various failures in health care have contributed to his death: a) Failure of MH nurse at about 22.00 to make an adequate risk assessment and care plan, in particular not instructing 1:1 observations. b) Failure of a MH nurse in Home Treatment Team at 00.45 when he was intoxicated to make a meaningful risk management plan c) Failure of a MH nurse at around 03.00 to record and communicate at the time he finished his observations that Mr Dunne was high risk and required 1:1 observations d) Failure of an A&E triage nurse around 01.40 to escalate a deterioration in mental state when inserting the IV line e) Failure of the nurse in charge in the A&E department to ensure any observations after 03.30, when he was left on his own. Without these failures he would have been supervised, formally risk and capacity reassessed and either detained under the Mental Health Act and/or prevented from leaving and so would not have died when he did.","Mr Paul Dunne had a history of depression, anxiety, episodic alcohol abuse, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and two voluntary admissions to a mental health ward. He was brought to Princess Royal University Hospital A&E department at 20.40 on 1st January 2020, after an overdose of Paracetamol, having been persuaded by his family and emergency services personnel. He was at high risk of suicide and required continuous 1:1 observations, but never had them. There were poor communications between MH staff and A&E staff, exacerbated by separate medical recording. He deceitfully absconded four times whilst in the department, twice purchasing and drinking more alcohol. Security staff were not alerted to his risks. He did not have repeated risk or capacity assessments, nor have a Mental Health Act assessment, despite his circumstances and mental state deteriorating. After removing his IV line, he finally absconded for the final time, which could have been prevented. Police were notified, briefed by the A&E department just before 05.30 and took steps to find him, following their Missing Persons Policy. He was found dead, having suspended himself in the nearby children's playground, at 07.47 on 2nd January.","Many of the failings have been addressed locally. But during the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN addressed to Oxleas and CQC are as follows. – 1. Individual mental health professionals appeared to have gaps in knowledge and judgment. The director who was spokesperson for the Mental Health Trust did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of these deficits.  A mental health liaison nurse, who now is manager of these nurses, did not recognize the patient as high risk, despite his having been persuaded to attend A&E by the police against his will, having just expressed suicidal ideation, made a previous attempt, with alcohol intoxication and absconsion, as at the time he denied suicidality. Even in retrospect in court she did not acknowledge her misjudgement. She also asserted incorrectly that a patient who has mental capacity cannot be assessed under the Mental Health Act.  A mental health nurse of 9 years standing in the Home Treatment Team who acknowledged the risk to the patient's life could hardly be higher, failed to document his assessment, as he could not find anywhere to write it before going on his break. No staff acknowledged that he had informed them of the risk. He assumed the patient would get 1:1 monitoring, but did not direct anyone to the need. When asked what he would have done if he had known there were no staff to conduct 1:1 monitoring, he said that he could perhaps hang around for a bit longer. 2. The Mental Health Trust  Staff and it appears the director even at the time of the inquest did not appreciate that the A&E policies (Missing Persons, Shared Care) which required risk assessment after an absconsion and alerting managers to the need for extra temporary staff if 1:1 monitoring was needed, also applied to MH staff.  Evidence was heard that staff in KCH A&E and Oxleas NH Trust had been trained on different risk assessment documents. Although meetings had been reinstated between departments, there had been no audit of absconsions or MH liaison in A&E. The MATTERS OF CONCERN addressed to NHSE and DH are as follows. 3. MH staff and A&E staff write their clinical records in different systems and hospital staff do not have access to MH Rio records. MH staff attending A&E departments are asked to make a double entry in the A&E records as well. Here that was omitted, potentially with fatal risks. Moving to a combined electronic system (now identified as EPIC) has long been the aim of the local health providers, but evidence was heard that the pace of introduction, which is very slow, is in the hands of national NHS leadership. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: The deceased ended his life by suicide. The assessment of the level of risk posed was appropriate as was the overall plan to address this risk. However there was a failure to pass on all of the pertinent risk management information to those making decisions; the full purpose of asking the deceased to return to barracks was not communicated effectively to him, protective factors mitigating the resulting lack of proximity to family, including meeting him or assessing his welfare on arrival, were not considered. These factors taken together may possibly have contributed to his death on that day.","On the 11th September 2023 Charlie Anthony Owen was found deceased in his room at the Combermere Barracks, Windsor. On the 5th September 2023 he had taken action to end his own life which he aborted and sought help from his lieutenant. This was the second time that he had made, and aborted, an attempt to end his own life; both of which occurred in the context of relationship breakdown. The army arranged a medical and mental health assessment and Charlie denied current intent to end his life in all subsequent conversations with medical and army personnel. Charlie was still assessed as posing a risk to himself and was called back to his battalion. This was for further assessment and treatment as well as a return to work. Not all relevant information was shared and considered when plans were made for his return. He left his family home in Wales on the 10th September; having prepared notes indicating an intent to end his life at some point prior to this. After returning to barracks he hung himself.",During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Vulnerability Risk Management (VRM) process I heard evidence that the army VRM guidance does not invite those attending case conferences to consider 'checking in' or meeting those assessed as posing a risk of self-harm on return to their unit. In this inquest no consideration was given to this possibility even though Charlie posed an elevated level of risk and had been initially placed under the VRM process whilst at home. This gives rise to a concern that the army does not know where soldiers who pose a risk are and does not facilitate additional support that may be necessary. I accept the evidence I heard that different units will have different requirements but this would not prevent them from giving consideration of this issue. Training I heard that suicide prevention training is not mandatory for army welfare officers/welfare NCOs. This gives rise to a concern that those specifically tasked to deal with people who are most likely to pose a risk of suicide or self harm are not best equipped to identify this and assist the individual. I heard evidence regarding the VRM process training. I am concerned that there is insufficient focus in that training on the actual aim including reducing risk and preventing suicide. A better understanding of risks and the purpose of VRM seems likely to assist those tasked with running it. Information sharing Witnesses for the army have noted that information sharing between medical and command personnel poses challenges. I am concerned that the VRM process does not require adequate documentation of the information shared. The lack of detail contained within the case conference notes hindered this inquest's ability to establish precisely what risk information was shared. This gives rise to a concern that audits of effectiveness and potential learning points are being missed. I was concerned to hear that when a risk management and safety plan has been prepared by the Defence mental health services the information contained about relevant protective factors and safety actions is not necessarily shared with the Chain of Command. There is no prompt on the relevant template to remind of team of the potential benefit of sharing this information or requesting consent from the individual in question to do so which gives rise to a concern that this important information is not shared. 6

Allison was 12 years old when she passed away on the 19th July 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 17th August 2023. The conclusion was that Allison died as a result of suicide, contributed to by neglect.","Allison Aules was referred to the mental health team in May 2021 with concerns around evidence of self-harm, low mood, anxiety and enuresis. Her case was inappropriately screened as routine and the referral was triaged 8 weeks later. Allison was not communicated with at this time, but her mother shared a full account of concerns with the triage psychologist. Additional concerns were raised during triage and the matter was taken to a multi-disciplinary team. The team decided that Allison should be assessed face to face. They determined the case to be low risk and placed it in the green zone. The concerns shared with the service should have resulted in a more urgent face to face assessment. The assessment of Allison took place 9 months later. This was not a face-to-face assessment, as directed by the multi-disciplinary team. There was a telephone discussion, initially with Allison's mother alone. Allison later spoke to the assessor but there was no full assessment of her mental state. There was no full exploration of the concerns raised in the referral and in the triage discussion. There was no evidence of the assessor determining the cause of Allison's worrying presentation. There was no carefully documented assessment of risk. There was no carefully devised risk management plan. A decision was made to discharge Allison from the mental health team, with no multi-disciplinary review or liaison with the referrer. Allison continued to receive counselling provided at her school, but this concluded at the end of term, on the 15 July 2022. On the 18 July 2022 Allison was found suspended in her bedroom. The failure to provide basic mental health care to Allison contributed to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced. The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern. The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country. There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams. The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor. The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10 – 12 per week. The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week. There is a concern that ongoing under resourcing of CAMHS services (whilst demand continues to increase), will result in future similar deaths. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 December 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was one of suicide.,"Olivia Russell had a history of anxiety which was initial managed without medication. In October 2020 she contacted your surgery and discussed options to treat her anxiety as this had worsened. She initially decided against anti-depressants but subsequently had another appointment on 2 November where she opted for a 10mg dose of citalopram. Following a period of apparent stability, Olivia stopped taking her medication in or around June 2021 without consulting a GP, subsequently suffering a relapse and re-starting her medication in August 2021. Sadly, Olivia took her own life on 19 September 2021.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the inquest, evidence was heard from , one of your salaried GPs as to his interactions with Olivia, and based on the records, his colleagues' interactions. There was no evidence within the notes that the risk of relapse if a medication is stopped was discussed in either November 2020 or August 2021, nor is there evidence that Olivia was told she may feel worse before she feels better. I did not find that this advice was not given, simply that I could not say either way. When asked, evidence was that you would discuss the risks when prescribing the drug, but was not entirely clear as to which risks he would discuss, and gave evidence that it is likely each GP has a different approach, bearing in mind the time limitations of the appointment. He could not say with confidence that every GP within the practice was discussing these key risks. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 A copy of the relevant NICE guidance was provided to me which states that these risks should be discussed with the patient, and I look specifically at sections 1.3.1 and 1.5.2 as a minimum. I am concerned that this guidance is not being followed as a matter of routine within the surgery and that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths. I am also concerned that a significant event meeting (acknowledging I may have the name of this review meeting incorrect) has not yet taken place, despite Olivia's death being over 2 years ago. The evidence of was that this will take place after the inquest and I am concerned that, if this is the practice following all deaths, there is a risk that learning from deaths will be delayed or missed. 6"

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH 2.THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCE OFFICER OF HERTFORDSHIRE AND WEST ESSEX INTEGRATED CARE BOARD 1,On 7 August 2017 an investigation was commenced by the Senior Coroner for Hertfordshire into the death of Megan Leanne DAVISON. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard on 28th March 2018. The first inquest conclusion was quashed and a fresh investigation directed by the High Court on 17th May 2022. A second inquest was heard by me from 24th June 2024 to 10th July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: Ms Davison died by suicide in the context of personality disorder and Type 1 diabetes with disordered eating (also known as T1DE). The medical cause of death was: 1a Suspension 1b 1c II Personality Disorder and Type 1 Diabetes with Disordered Eating (also known as T1DE),"Megan Davison was found deceased at her home address on 4th August 2017, having hanged herself with the intention of ending her life. The following issues possibly made a more than minimal contribution to Ms Davison's death: (a) Ms Davison's discharge from the care of the Mental Health Trust on 1st August 2017; (b) Lack of integration between mental health and physical healthcare systems; (c) Absence of a recognised diagnosis for Type 1 Diabetes with Disordered Eating (also known as T1DE) and absence of pathways of care for T1DE and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (by way of physical and mental health protocols); (d) Lack of consolidated records and direct communication systems between different parts of the healthcare system.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (a) On a national level there is not a system which is capable of being operated in a way which will ensure proper integrated healthcare for patients with T1DE. Specifically, there is no formal diagnosis for T1DE, no treatment pathway for T1DE and no complete treatment pathway for Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), an acute clinical emergency associated with T1DE caused by deliberate omission of insulin, which should be seen as an act of self harm - there being a physical protocol, but no mental health protocol, for DKA. I heard independent evidence from , Professor of Psychiatry and Medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences at Kings College London that "" the lack of a diagnosis for T1DE has an impact because if you don't know what you are looking for and there aren't any criteria that you can screen by then it's very difficult for both patients and clinicians to understand what is wrong with them and this has hampered development of recognition and treatment pathways and building the research evidence"". (Copies of s independent expert reports for the Inquest are attached). (b) At a local level in East and North Hertfordshire there is no integrated healthcare system for patients with diabetes and eating disorder as there is in the west of the county. (c) Whilst there have been significant advances in developing shared clinical records systems across primary and secondary care since Ms Davison's death in 2017, none of the shared records systems extends to organisations which are deemed to be private providers, such as The Priory. The perception of healthcare providers such The Priory as ""private"" providers is a fallacy, because a high percentage of patients looked after by such providers are, like Ms Davison, NHS patients. I heard evidence from the Chief Medical Officer of The Priory that record sharing which includes private providers would help to prevent future deaths. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 June 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide,"On the morning of 28 June 2023 Thomas Joseph Geraghty entered the sea from the beach at Eastbourne. He was not witnessed entering the water. At around 11:45, Mr Geraghty's body was seen floating by a nearby lifeguard and he was recovered to the beach. Resuscitation was attempted however it was sadly unsuccessful and death was confirmed.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Mr Geraghty had been prescribed anti-psychotic medication since 2007, which he took on a daily basis. His symptoms responded well to the medication and his mental health was assessed in 2015 as stable. Mr Geraghty informed his family that he felt safe taking his medication and had intended to remain on it for life. In January 2021, Mr Geraghty's GP surgery noted that he had moved out of its catchment area and a letter was sent to him advising him to register with a new surgery closer to his new home address. Mr Geraghty does not appear to have registered with a new surgery and remained a patient of his original surgery. He continued to receive a repeat prescription for his anti-psychotic medication and received his COVID vaccinations and also text messages from the surgery relating to smoking cessation advice up to November 2021. On 4 May 2022, the surgery sent Mr Geraghty a text message to confirm that they were still prescribing his medication and that he needed to provide his new surgery details. No details were provided by Mr Geraghty and he continued to be prescribed his anti-psychotic medication with the last prescription, a two-month supply, issued on 10 November 2022. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Mr Geraghty requested a repeat prescription via his usual automated service on 12 January 2023. Mr Geraghty appears to have been deregistered as a patient by the surgery on 16 January 2023 and there does not appear to have been any communication with Mr Geraghty at this time to inform him of the deregistration. Two chaser emails were sent to the surgery by the pharmacy to seek authorisation for the prescription but no response was received and Mr Geraghty, who had not yet registered with another surgery went without his anti-psychotic medication. He was not on any medication at the time of his death and family noted that some of his psychotic symptoms had returned in June 2023. I have a concern that individuals can be removed from the surgery as patients without any scrutiny as to whether the individual may be receiving vital medication (either for a mental health or physical health issue). There does not appear to be any process of review in relation to these patients to ensure that they will continue to receive their medication after they are deregistred from the surgery. This is of particular concern where a patient is deregistered and the surgery has not been provided with details of an individual's new GP. There is a concern that in these circumstances, an individual may be left without access to medication, which could cause or contribute to their death. 6"

A probable contributing factor was the extended lock up due to the covid regime and staff shortages meaning that Mr Steadman had not left his cell at all on 26/02/2022. A possible contributing factor was the inadequate implementation of the ACCT process on 26/02/2022","In January 2020 Craig Steadman was released from Custody on Licence but a week later he breached a condition and was remanded back to HMP Winchester on 13th January. He had Diabetes and a mental health history, was on a weekly anti psychotic injection plus a history of multiple self harming incidents including overdosing on [REDACTED]. . After being assessed as suitable to hold his own medication he overdosed on [REDACTED] on 17th January 2020 and was placed on an ACCT which was closed again on 18th January.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) There were several investigations into Craig Steadman's death including a post incident review by HMP Winchester, the PPO,and the prison healthcare provider. Various recommendations flowed from the above. However upon questioning of various members of staff called to give evidence at the Inquest it became clear that several of them were not aware of the findings of the investigations nor the recommendations. The reports had not been shared with staff directly involved with Craig during his recent time in custody.

The medical cause of death was 1a) Hanging,Holly May Mullan had longstanding severe abdominal pain. She had long delays waiting for medical appointments to see gynaecologists and gastroenterologists due to long waiting lists. At times she accessed private consultations to try and obtain insight into and relief from her pain. On 7th May 2023 Holly May Mullan was found at 3 Napier Road attached to a ligature.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – The inquest heard evidence of the distress caused to Holly and the impact on her health by the long waits to be seen by gastroenterologists and gynaecologists within the NHS. The evidence heard was that post- Covid, the waiting times to be seen in both specialities unless the referral 1 was on the two-week cancer wait had grown significantly across England. As an illustration the inquest was told that pre-Covid, the average wait for a routine gynaecology referral was 18 weeks. Now in England the wait was often in excess of 12 months. Even an urgent referral would often involve a wait of over 40 weeks. This was leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment even in those with significant/severe health conditions. 6"

I made a determination at inquest that he died as a result of suicide.","Paul Taylor had been under police investigation for offences that necessitated consideration of the Suicide Prevention and Risk Management of Suspects policy, Nottinghamshire Police document PS260, by the police. That policy was complied with. It was appropriate not to arrest Mr Taylor at the outset of the investigation, so he was voluntarily interviewed and he was released under investigation for a two year period. Within a fortnight of him being made aware that criminal charges had been authorised, he intentionally took a large quantity of prescription medication and was found deceased at his home address on 3 January 2024.","; When a suspect is arrested for offences requiring a referral to a mental health nurse, commonly referred to in Nottinghamshire as “Liaison and Diversion” the custody sergeant makes that referral automatically, which allows the opportunity for a suspect to obtain assistance from a healthcare professional, if they desire. In addition, there are welfare assessments conducted by the officer in charge of the investigation. In cases where a suspect is interviewed on a voluntary basis for relevant offences, the suspect is not dealt with at a custody suite and a referral to a mental health nurse is not automatic. In this latter scenario, only welfare assessments are completed by the officer in charge of the investigation without any involvement from healthcare services. A policy revision is being undertaken to ensure that the procedures for supporting and safeguarding suspects of relevant offences are consistent, irrespective of whether the individual has been arrested or invited for voluntary attendance. In both scenarios, suspects receive an officer welfare assessment together with an automatic referral to Liaison and Diversion (healthcare services). The amendment to the policy and communication to the organisation will be implemented by 1st March 2025. Yours sincerely, Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire Police"

There is no requirement for them to do further training or continual professional development. There are no rules or regulations about how counsellors should operate, for example how they keep and share records. iii. Information shared by an individual to a counsellor may disclose a risk of self harm or suicide, or harm to another and there is no requirement for a counsellor to report that information to any third party. iv. gave evidence that the lack of regulation and licensing of counsellors could lead to a lot of damage being done to individuals seeking help and that this could present a risk to life as there is no regulation around informing medical professionals or others who can provided further support and care to the individual. v.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on . The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide The cause of death was established as: I a Hanging (suspension by a ligature around the neck),"Ash Bannister was a 16 year old who was assigned female at birth but became gender neutral, Ash wanted to be referred to as “they” or “their”. Ash was born in Croydon in 2004 and had a very difficult start to life. Ash first became known to social services in 2005 after concerns were raised about Ash being exposed to drug use in the family home, [REDACTED] and physical abuse. Ash was subject to a Child Protection Plan and ultimately placed into foster care in 2006 due to concerns about neglect and the misuse of drugs at home. Ash remained looked after until 2007 when Ash returned to her father's care. Social care became involved again when Ash was around 10 or 11 years old. In January 2018 Ash's family confirmed they were no longer able to manage Ash at home and keep the rest of the family safe, Ash was therefore to move into a residential placement. Ash remained in residential care until she died on 7 August 2021. Ash was involved with multiple agencies throughout life and was a child with complex needs. Ash had multiple vulnerabilities including early neglect, a difficult childhood, the fact Ash was a looked after child, a history of exposure to Child Sexual Exploitation, mental health difficulties and a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder along with some potential difficulties around eating and exploration of their gender identity. Ash was first referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (“CAMHS”) in around 2009 or 2010 at the age of 5 or 6 whilst living in Croydon. Ash had a long history of self-harming, this started at a very early age (9 years old) and was a theme throughout Ash's short life. Ash experienced both auditory and visual hallucinations. Ash would hear a male voice which told Ash that they were worthless, the voice would belittle Ash and encouraged self-harming. Ash was found hanging [REDACTED] at the residential care home (which was run by United Children's Services) where they lived on 7 August 2021. Ash was confirmed dead at 0922hrs by East Midlands Ambulance Service.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Risk Assessments I heard evidence to confirm that Ash was subject to a Ligature Risk Assessment which was put into place after Ash ligatured in December 2020, at that time the Risk was deemed to be a “medium” risk. The Ligature Risk Assessment was reassessed in April 2021 at which time the risk level was lowered to “low”. I heard evidence to confirm that at some point between the April 2021 review and Ash's death a decision to remove Ash's personal Ligature Risk Assessment was made. United Children's Services were unable to tell me the date on which the decision to remove Ash's Ligature Risk Assessment was made because there is no documentation relating to the date on which that decision was made or the reasons why that decision was made. This lack of documentation is a grave concern. Ash died on 7 August 2021 from 1a) Hanging (suspension placing a ligature around the neck) there was no personal Ligature Risk Assessment in place at the time of death. Documentation and communication I heard evidence to confirm there was no documentation created by United Children's Services to detail the date on which Ash's Ligature Risk Assessment was deemed to be no longer required or to explain the rationale behind the making of that decision. There is no documentation to explain or justify the deviation from Ash's care plan on the morning that Ash died. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 Further, the Court heard evidence to confirm that there was little or no communication of Ash's historic Child Sexual Exploitation risk between the two United Children's Services care homes when Ash moved from The Oaks to The Laurels in July 2020. Lack of documentation and poor communication is a concern. Waking Night Cover I heard evidence to confirm that Ash had consumed alcohol on the evening of 5 August 2021. Due to appropriate concerns about the consumption of alcohol when on anti-psychotic medication staff at the residential care home implemented an “ad hoc” waking night process, this means that a member of staff remained outside Ash's bedroom door and awake all night. During the waking night period Ash went into the lavatory and made what are described as “superficial” cuts to her neck, a blade was later removed from Ash. The next day, on 6 August 2021, staff described Ash as having a good day. Ash went to bed as normal at around 2150hrs. There was no ad hoc waking night cover implemented. Ash was not checked on from the time Ash went to bed at 2150hrs until 0900hrs on the 7 August 2021, a period of 11 hours. During those 11 hours Ash ended their life. Ash was found hanging at 9am on 7 August 2021. The decision to implement ad hoc waking night cover is not a decision which is governed by policy at United Children's Services. I heard evidence to confirm that the decision is based upon the gut instinct of the staff on duty at the time. The fact there is no policy to specifically deal with ad hoc waking nights means the decision making around the same will not be consistent and therefore the level of care provided to the children in the care of United Children's Services is heavily dependent on which staff member is on duty at the time that the care is needed. Further, there is no step down process to wean children off ad hoc waking night cover. In Ash's case Ash went from having a staff member outside her door throughout the night from 5 to 6 August 2021 to having a period of 11 hours where Ash was entirely unsupervised throughout the night from 6 to 7 August 2021. It was during those 11 unsupervised hours that Ash ended their life. Compliance with care and support plans Ash had a “support plan” and I was told in evidence that support plans contain “crucial” information relating to residents. Ash's support plan stipulated that Ash was to be checked on every morning at 7am. Ash was not checked upon at 7am on the morning of her death, this is a breach of Ash's support plan. There was nothing documented in any of the records disclosed to the Court to explain why the support plan was deviated from on this occasion. I was told by care home workers that they would not expect to check on a teenager at 7am at the weekend in a normal family home. The residential care home where Ash was living was not a normal family home but a therapeutic home for children with complex needs. The evidence from the Operations Manager at United Children's Services who run the home was that Ash should have been checked on at 7am. Ash's support plan was incorrectly deviated from without any documentation, explanation or justification as to why. This should not have happened. Staff training The Court heard evidence from one member of staff who worked at a United Children's Services Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 care home for a period of 4.5 months and did not know what Child Sexual Exploitation was. The Court heard evidence to confirm that new staff members have 6 months to complete all of their training meaning it is possible to have staff members working with children with complex needs and vulnerabilities who do not have a full understanding of the spectrum of their needs due to not having completed all of their training yet. United Children's Services Investigation policy and process I heard evidence to confirm that United Children's Services do have an investigations policy, albeit that document was not disclosed to the Court despite a request for confirmation as to whether any internal investigation of any kind was undertaken and confirmation of what investigatory processes were available to United Children's Services to use after Ash's death. I heard conflicting evidence at the inquest in relation to whether an investigation was undertaken by United Children's Services after Ash's death. I was told (1) there was no internal investigation but they did feed into the Local Authority's Safeguarding Investigation and (2) there was an investigation undertaken by United Children's Services but the outcome of the investigation was not documented. I heard evidence from the Operations Manager at United Children's Services to confirm that the investigation which took place after Ash's death but which was not formally documented was discussed at the United Children's Service's Board Meeting around 6 or 7 months post death. Ash died in August 2021, the Board Meeting will therefore have taken place in or around February or March 2022. I heard evidence to confirm that the required changes to the United Children's Services investigation policy and process were discussed at the Board Meeting but that at the time of the inquest, 2 years and 1 month after the Board Meeting and 2 years and 8 months after Ash's death, those changes had “not yet” been made. I asked why changes had not been made and was told that United Children's Services wanted to get the inquest process “out of the way” before making any changes. I have grave concerns about the fact that United Children's Services have been running homes in the knowledge that they have an inadequate investigation process in place for over two years. Significant learning came to light at the inquest which United Children's Services were not aware of before the inquest. It was accepted by United Children's Services that their investigation policy and process was not fit for purpose because it failed to identify all of the learning arising from Ash's death. If an investigation was undertaken by United Children's Services after Ash's death it: (1) Was not documented; (2) Failed to identify all of the learning uncovered at the inquest; (3) Failed to trigger any changes at United Children's Services. The investigation process in place at United Children's Services is therefore not fit for purpose. Policies and processes at United Children's Services in general I have concerns about policies and processes in place at United Children's Services, including the investigations policy, the policies governing risk assessments, in particular the ligature risk assessment, and the ad hoc waking nights process. I heard evidence at the inquest about United Children's Service's plan to make, what appear on the face of it, to be broad and wide-reaching changes to their policies and processes. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 16/05/2023 However, at the time of writing this report those changes have not been discussed, finalised, implemented or embedded. The children in the care of the United Children's Services will, in my opinion, remain at risk until such time as appropriate and effective action is taken and the necessary changes are implemented and embedded at the company and within their care homes. 6"

On the 25 July 2024 I concluded an Inquest into his death at the end of a 3-day hearing.,"The immediate circumstances are that: On 24 March 2023, Martyn was detained by police in Sussex after being found at [REDACTED] where he had ostensibly gone to take his own life. He was taken to Eastbourne District General Hospital. There he was assessed and deemed liable for detention under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. However, there were no available mental health beds nationally and a suitable placement could not be found for him. Having been at the hospital since Friday evening, he contacted family members on Sunday, 26 March who collected him and brought him back to his home in Oxfordshire. On 27 March 2023, Martyn left his home and stepped in front of a lorry on the A4074. Witnesses described his actions as deliberate. The medical cause of death was determined following a post-mortem examination to be multi-organ failure and polytrauma resulting from a road traffic collision .","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – As you will note from the Conclusion, an application for compulsory detention for Martyn could not be completed due to the unavailability of beds despite extensive searches nationally. My findings were that: 'It is the case that a Health Based Place of Safety bed did become available but a decision was taken that due to anticipated demand for potential patients not to offer this to Martyn.' And also that: 'in my view highly likely that Martyn would have benefitted from a further admission to hospital – as he had previously – and he would have prevented from further relapse and ultimately taking the actions he did on the morning of the 27 March.' I heard evidence from experience mental health professionals that the lack of beds for those requiring detention under the Mental Health Act was a frequent occurrence. In my view, you should consider a review of sufficiency of provision for suitable placements for those requiring compulsory treatment. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 January 2024. The Conclusion of the Inquest was that the Deceased died as result of Suicide .,"The Deceased suffered with physical disabilities, mental health issues, and alcoholism. Her husband of 39 years was her main carer. At around 19.15 hours on 3 January 2023, the Deceased reported to Police that her husband was being violent towards her. On attending, the Police could see no visible marks or cuts but arrested her husband; the Deceased made it clear that she did not support any criminal action against him. On 4 January 2023, her husband was bailed until 28 February 2023 with conditions that he was not to return to the marital home. Police also made a Safeguarding Referral to Social Services who organised an urgent welfare visit to the Deceased that same evening. The Deceased refused all care services offered during the visit and stated that she would kill herself if her husband did not return home (but not that evening). The Deceased continued to refuse care when contacted by Social Services the following morning but was provided with the telephone number for the Safeguarding Team. Sometime between 14.45 and 15.45 on 6 January 2023 and, in a distressed state, Sylvia left a message on the Safeguarding Team's phone requesting help. At 15.06 hours, she also sent a text to her Victim Engagement Officer stating that she could not cope on her own and requesting a call. Although a member of the Safeguarding Team spoke briefly to her on the phone at 16.30 hours, they requested Police to make an urgent welfare visit; a 'prompt response' was organised by Police Control Room at 16.56 hours but, owing to service demand, they arrived at 19.24 hours and found the Deceased unresponsive on the living room floor. Despite all resuscitation efforts, paramedics confirmed her death at 20.25 hours. [REDACTED] and notes to her husband and to Police were found at the scene. The notes confirmed an intention to end her life and the note to Police indicated that she felt that they had not listened to her.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Although the Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) carried out in this case has already recommended a number of issues for agencies to consider, additional matters have been observed by the Court in relation to Police action: (i) Whilst some officers carried out their tasks effectively and appropriately, overall important steps in the Deceased's husband's arrest and subsequent conditional pre-charge bail did not appear to have been followed. (ii) In particular, S47ZZA PACE 1984 requires the investigating officer to seek the views of the alleged victim on whether relevant conditions should be imposed on the person's bail and then to inform the custody officer of these views but this was not done in this case: the first time that the Deceased was made aware of the nature of her husband's bail conditions was when the Police brought him home after his release on bail to collect his belongings. (iii) An earlier discussion between Police and the Deceased might have highlighted the Deceased's deep emotional and physical dependence on her husband and the need to consider alternative options to criminal investigation with potentially more supportive care attached to them, such as the use of a DVPN/DVPO as highlighted by the DHR. 6"

The College of Policing 1,"On the 25th October 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Samuel Curless (Sam). Sam died on the 24th October 2022 at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. He was 29 years old. The investigation into his death concluded on the 2nd February 2024 when I completed the inquest into his death. The medical cause of death was found to be 1a) Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy caused by 1b) hanging. I recorded a conclusion of suicide.","Sam had a long history of anxiety and depression. He had reported feeling suicidal in the past. He was the sole carer for his young son and his son was a protective factor for him. On the 23rd September 2022, the deceased was arrested at home in relation to an allegation of a serious criminal offence. He was taken to the police station where he was interviewed under caution. He was released on bail the same day with conditions not to have any contact with anyone under the age of 18. On Friday 21st October, Sam was informed that all of his bail conditions were removed, but that he remained under investigation. He was provided with police documentation that confirmed this. Sam contacted the children's social worker and informed her of the change to his bail and asked if he could now see his son unsupervised. The social worker told him that she would need to verify the bail position with the police before their plan could change. Sam agreed to continue with the supervised contact on Monday, but he would have found it difficult to hear and understand. At 14:05 on Saturday 22nd October, Sam made a call to GMP 101 service from his mobile phone. This call was connected to a GMP Call Handler at 14:12 and a police log was commenced. From the audio recording of the call, Sam could be heard telling the Call Handler that he thought he had found a dead body. He gave the location [REDACTED]. He said it was the first plot near some stainless-steel containers near the car park. The conversation between the deceased and the call handler lasted approximately 40 seconds, after which Sam did not respond to further attempts at engagement. The call handler kept the line open for just over 5 minutes. As the deceased's call to GMP was a 101 call (and not a 999 call), the Call Handler was not able to obtain the precise location using his mobile phone and data services. She obtained a street name to add to the location after talking to her supervisor. The Call Handler did not know that the deceased had any intent to take his own life, but she did conclude that there was a risk that the dead body he was reporting might not be dead. At 14:29 she graded the THRIVE risk as High and Graded the GMP Response as 1. She coded the call as G15 which includes a concern for welfare or risk of suicide. Radio Operators dispatched GMP officers at 14:33. The Call Handler failed to call an ambulance at 14:29. It was a GMP minimum standard expectation that she should have done so at the point that she had a location to dispatch to and was part of her training in response to reports of a dead body. [REDACTED] gave evidence to the inquest that this was an admitted failing by GMP, but I found that it did not make any material contribution to the death. Two Officers attended [REDACTED] at 14:38 within the Grade 1 response time. They located the Sam in a shed [REDACTED] at 14:42. They found him suspended from a ligature [REDACTED]. The first officer on the scene assumed that she was looking at a dead body. She did not check for a pulse until around 14:46. A total of three officers were in attendance by this point. A further check at 14:48 revealed that he was still warm and only at that point was he cut down. After further checks for a pulse, CPR was commenced by the officers at 14:50. The three initial attending officers failed to administer any basic life support to Sam for approximately 8 minutes after discovering him suspended. The officers failed to perform any immediate initial checks of Sam's vital signs when they discovered him. The officers failed to remove the ligature and therefore an airway obstruction at the earliest opportunity. It was GMP and College of Policing Policy that officers attending a suspected sudden death should not assume death, should make preservation of life their priority and not delay in administering basic life support until an ambulance arrives. In their evidence to the inquest, these failings were admitted by the officers but I found that did not make any material contribution to the death. The attending officers all assumed that an ambulance had been called by GMP comms. In fact, one was only contacted at 14:48. NWAS went mobile at 14:57 and attended the scene at 15:01 and commenced advanced life support. Following paramedic intervention, spontaneous circulation returned at 15:24. Sam was then taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary, where despite appropriate resuscitation and life preserving treatments he died on the 24th October 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. That in respect of GMP Call Handler's being required to call an ambulance to attend the scene, even where it is reported that someone is “dead” there has been no institutional learning following this incident. I asked if there had been any learning, reflection or training since this incident. He said that there hadn't on this issue. 2. That the training delivered to the first two attending officers did not adequately prepare them for responding to a scene where someone is found hanging in a way which is consistent with their priority to preserve life of a hanging casualty. 3. I heard evidence from Detective Superintendent that both attending officers were part of a cohort of at least 650 officers within GMP (and a larger cohort nationally) who received their 3 initial police training entirely online. I am concerned that both officers' training on Sudden Death (and the training of others) was delivered as one of over 15 online modules on a given day and that at the time of the inquest, they had not received any classroom based or on the job training. I am concerned that they are not the only officers within GMP who have received this level/method of training input and therefore there is a risk that other officers on duty have inadequate training on this issue. 4. There was evidence given to me by Detective Superintendent that there is an unknown number of GMP officers who are not meeting the expectation of receiving First Aid refresher training within 12 months, which since May 2022 has included training on how to resuscitate a hanging casualty. I am therefore concerned that there remains a cohort of officers who have not had the post May 2022 training that includes how to provide Basic Life Support to this kind of casualty until the arrival of an ambulance. 6"

National Police Chiefs' Council 3. NHS England 1,"An investigation was commenced into the death of Jack Peter Zarrop, aged 23. The investigation concluded on 29 September 2023. The conclusion of the jury in the inquest was: Suicide. We, the jury, find the: 1. Failure to remove the bedsheet and close the hatch allowing Jack to create a ligature point 2. Failure to refer to Liaison and Diversion services in Central and North-West London and the failure to open an ACCT whilst in prison custody, either of which would have triggered a more thorough risk assessment 3. The difficulties accessing relevant and important information relevant to J. Zarrop's history, both medical and custodial were the main contributing factors to the death of J. Zarrop. The medical cause of death was 1a Aspyhxia 1b Hanging","Jack had a history of difficulties with his mental health and a history of alcohol abuse. He had made multiple previous suicide attempts, including a very serious previous suicide attempt of hanging. He had previously been arrested in December 2020 and assessed by Liaison & Diversion services whilst in Police custody. After he was remanded in custody, he was placed on an ACCT twice in prison. After his release from prison on 14th February 2021, he was referred to the community Mental Health Crisis service by his GP and also had another very recent suicide attempt in the form of an overdose of anti- depressants about a week before he was again arrested on 17th March 2021. In Police custody, he was seen by a Custodial Nurse Practitioner (CNP) who had very limited training in Mental Health and the recognition of the risk of suicide. The CNP was working alone and not alongside a doctor. The CNP assessed Jack's risk as low. The CNP also did not refer him to Liaison & Diversion services, which the jury found that probably contributed to Jack's death. A Forensic Medical Examiner in Police custody subsequently assessed Jack's risk as high. Jack was again remanded in custody. Despite Jack's significant risk history as well as other significant risk factors, such as being young, withdrawing from alcohol and early days in custody, no ACCT was opened by prison or healthcare staff, who were overly reassured by Jack's presentation. An agency healthcare member of staff had no training in the ACCT process. The jury found that the failure to open an ACCT by prison and healthcare staff probably contributed to Jack's death and that, on the balance of probability, the risk of suicide was not adequately identified for Jack. These findings by the jury were based on the over-emphasis by prison and healthcare staff on Jack's presentation against clear and evidenced previous suicide and self-harm risks and attempts, which were available to relevant police, prison and healthcare staff. The Court heard evidence that 65% of primary care healthcare staff in prison are agency staff. The Home Office circular from 2003 relating to the use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners refers working alongside doctors and being specifically trained for their role. However, the Circular makes no mention of assessing the risk of suicide or self-harm in its Annex which lists competencies.","During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future. The 2003 Home Office circular also does not recognise the risk of suicide and self-harm as being a core competency. 2. The training of agency staff in the ACCT process and recognising the appropriate threshold to open an ACCT. The training of agency staff in ACCT does not appear to be part of the commissioning process by NHS England and individual providers do not appear to provide training to agency staff in the ACCT process. This places residents in prison at risk of death, given the high level of usage of agency healthcare staff in prison. 6"

He did note, however, that the matter had ostensibly been dealt with as a high-risk response for some time prior to its re-categorisation at that level. I was not able to conclude that the delay in raising the level of risk to high had been causative of the death as it was not known at what time had, in fact, hanged himself. It had to be noted that there was a period of approximately eight hours before he was first reported to police as a missing person. It was accepted in evidence that the decision as to the appropriate level of risk was essentially a ""judgement call"" on the part of the individual officer. It was further accepted that there would be occasions when these judgements would be very finely balanced. It was not felt that there had been any failure to follow practice or protocol at a local level. It was noted, however, that it would be sensible to share the salient facts with you in order that there could be a proper review of the guidance contained within the relevant College of Policing APP upon which the police officers relied. It was recognised that if the guidance could be clearer this may assist different officers from achieving a greater level of consistency in decision- making when faced with the same, complex set of facts. 2 Information Classification: CONFIDENTIAL 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, conducted before a jury, on 06 February 2024. The jury returned a narrative conclusion.","Daniel (referred to as Dan at the request of his family) was detained pursuant to s.2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 on Saturday 9th April 2022 and admitted to Redwood 1, Highbury Hospital, Nottingham the following day. He had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) and a long history of mental ill health, including multiple instances of self-harm and suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Following a period of relative stability, he presented at A&E on 5th April 2022 after an episode of deliberate self-harm. He disclosed suicidal thoughts. He was referred to the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team that day but was detained on 9th April after disclosing that he had not only an intention but a plan to end his life, details of which he declined to disclose. Due to previous negative experiences on Redwood 1, Dan requested a move to another ward. He declined nearly all attempts by staff to engage with him and was consistently described as low in mood, very withdrawn and largely confining himself to his bedroom. He was physically (though not formally) discharged following a Ward Round on 22nd April 2022. A clinical psychologist present at that Ward Round gave evidence that she raised concerns that his mental state and demeanour were not conducive to imminent discharge. Dan left Highbury Hospital at around 17:55 that day. At approximately 20:30, he ingested a lethal quantity of [REDACTED] which he purchased [REDACTED] prior to his detention and admission to Redwood 1. The jury found the following failings in Dan ' s care (the first four of which were admitted) contributed to his death: More should have been done to try and effect the move from Redwood 1 to another hospital/ward in line with Dan ' s wishes. There was a failure to allocate a Named Nurse and/or a failure of the allocated named nurse to carry out a 1:1 session with Dan during his admission. There was a lack of exploration in the Ward Round on 22 April 2022 and/or a lack of documentation of an exploration in the Ward Round of the “ plan ” that Dan had to end his life before his admission. There was a failure by ward staff to hand over information regarding a threat to ligate (noted in the handover sheet from 20 April 2022) to the Ward Round on the 22 April 2022. A failure to record and take appropriate action following significant risk-related incidents (Daniel expressing an intention to self-harm) which occurred during Dan ' s admission. A failure to take proper account of all available relevant information concerning Dan ' s risk when assessing his risk prior to discharge. The jury also found the following failings (the first three of which were admitted) but did not find these to have contributed to Dan ' s death: A failure to update Dan ' s ward specific Care Plan and Risk Assessment documentation in RIO during his admission. Dan had a Crisis Care Plan developed in August 2018 and updated in January 2019. There was a failure to update it in preparation for his discharge on 22 April 2022. A failure to adequately discuss Dan's risk with Dan's carer prior to discharge. A failure by the Trust to engage adequately with Dan ' s family and/or carers either during his admission on Redwood 1 and/or at the point of discharge. The inquest heard evidence that Dan had openly discussed his plans to end his own life on a chat forum of the [REDACTED] while detained at Highbury Hospital. It appears he also obtained information on [REDACTED] as a method of suicide and where to source it, from that site. [REDACTED]","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The following matters of concern are directed to NHCT for response ­ Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 1. A continuing practice/culture of minimising the importance of a ward specific risk assessment and care plan I am concerned that, notwithstanding the existence of a clear, appropriate policy and significant commendable actions by the Trust since Daniel's death to address this issue, there remain clinical and nursing staff who do not fully recognise or accept the importance of completing and utilising the required risk assessment and care plan. This suggests there may be a persisting training or cultural issue. The inquest heard evidence that there was (and remains) a clear and robust policy in place which most staff were aware of. This requires a care plan and risk assessment be initiated upon a patient's admission, completed within 72 hours of admission and updated as necessary during admission. Further, since Dan's death, the Trust has gone to considerable and commendable lengths to ensure that care plans and risks assessments are in place in every case and to reinforce the requirements of this guidance within the Nursing team; that team hold primary (but not sole) responsibility for creating and updating the risk assessment and care plan document. I also heard that a recent audit found that all current patients had an appropriate care plan in place. The Ward Manager agreed this is “a basic and fundamental part” of any patient's care. In spite of all of this, an experienced ward nurse and two psychiatrists (a consultant and a registrar) involved in Dan's care seemed to minimise the practical importance of the required process and documentation, the latter both suggesting they would not routinely consult it. 2. Inadequate system of allocating a named nurse to patients and recording the same I am concerned that, notwithstanding the existence of a clear, appropriate policy requiring the same, the current system of allocating a named nurse and ensuring patients receive regular and effective 1:1 sessions with them are inadequate. I am also concerned that no record is kept of the named nurse appointed to each patient, thus (as in this case) hindering any investigation where issue around the role and actions of that person arises. The General Manager of Adult Mental Health at the Trust helpfully and frankly acknowledged that the evidence heard at inquest raised questions about the adequacy of the existing system, of which he was not previously aware of. It remains unclear whether Daniel was appointed a Named Nurse who failed to perform that role effectively, or whether there was a failure to appoint such a nurse at all. The General Manager's view was that under the existing system, it is possible that a named nurse was appointed without their knowledge. While the Ward Manager gave evidence that she would have no confidence Daniel would have known who his named nurse was, even if one was appointed. The inquest heard evidence that named nurse sessions with Daniel during previous admissions had been important opportunities for engagement with staff and had elicited a substantial amount of information pertinent to his risk and treatment. The General Manager assured me that he has already requested an urgent review of the system, but he was unable to provide any further information upon conclusion of the inquest as to what further action, if any, is proposed. 3. Inadequate skills/knowledge/training on how to encourage patients to engage I am concerned that clinical, nursing and/or support staff may not currently have sufficient skills or knowledge in dealing with patients who appear unable or unwilling to engage with staff and/or treatment. A psychiatrist not involved in Dan's care gave evidence about the advice he would have given to colleagues on how to seek to assist a patient who, like Dan, was unwilling or unable to engage with staff: first, identify the likely reasons for the patient's lack of engagement; second, having regard to those reasons, develop plans and strategies to address the specific barriers identified. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 I heard little evidence that either of these steps was followed by any of the staff involved in Dan's care. One barrier was identified (his previous negative experiences on the ward and wish to be transferred to another ward or hospital) but seemingly forgotten after an initial transfer request to the Bed Management team, which was not then followed up. Even with the benefit of hindsight, the doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants involved in Dan's care seemed unable to offer any insight into the reasons for his difficulties engaging beyond his diagnosis of EUPD or articulate any strategies or techniques that might have helped him overcome them. The following matters of concern are addressed to Secretary of State for Health and Social Care & NHS England 1. I am concerned that confirmed ingestion of during a 999 call does not trigger a category 1 response from the Ambulance Service / Dan ingested at around 20:30 on 22 April 2022. His friend informed the 999 call handler that he had done so during a first 999 call at 20:39. That call was correctly graded as requiring a category 2 response, as Dan was both conscious and awake. 14 minutes later, at 20:53, Dan collapsed. His friend's second 999 call was correctly graded as requiring a category 1 response, as Dan had become unconscious, his breathing agonal. The first ambulance crew arrived at 21:04. Dan went into cardiac arrest at approximately 21:24. Consideration was given by the ambulance crew to scoop and run ' ' to arrange a rendezvous to administer the necessary “drugs to counter ”, but this was no considered longer feasible once Dan had gone into cardiac arrest. evidence expressed deep concern at its easy availability and growing popularity for vulnerable people seeking to end their own lives. The expert toxicological evidence indicated that its acute toxic effects can be rapid (as short as 20 minutes after ingestion, depending on dose) and can quickly become irreversible. The inquest heard evidence from a consultant toxicologist that even in very small quantities (or ) is lethal; it is a potent poison. I understand it is also, tragically, an increasingly common means of suicide. Mental health professionals who gave This suggests that almost any case involving the ingestion of or is likely to be a time critical life-threatening event. Yet it is does not currently fall within that category for the purposes of grading 999 calls, unless the patient is unconscious or not breathing. While there was no evidence that a category 1 response would have prevented Dan's death, I believe there is a risk that other deaths will occur if ingestion of continues to require a category 2 response. The following matters of concern are addressed to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Chief Executive of OFCOM 1. Continuing accessibility of Dan was using an online suicide forum, Through that forum he was able to engage in discussions with other members and obtain information Notwithstanding the provisions of the Online Safety Act 2023, and apparent attempts to block access to the website, I heard evidence that it remains easily accessible to vulnerable people in the UK. I am concerned that further deaths will occur while this remains the case. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 6"

The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Monoja died by suicide, likely while experiencing delusional and paranoid thoughts.","Mr Monoja had a history of chronic paranoid and delusional thinking. On 15 November 2020 his mother contacted 111 after he disclosed suicidal thinking to her. This was rapidly escalated to mental health services and that evening a member of the Crisis Assessment Team (CAT) assessed Mr Monoja. He denied remaining suicidal, agreed to treatment and was assessed to have capacity. He was referred to the Home Treatment Team (HTT). On 16 November 2020 Mr Monoja was assessed and accepted by the HTT and a care plan agreed. In the early hours of 17 November 2020, his mother woke and found Mr Monoja had left their home. She found him nearby on Cleaver Square, unresponsive. Emergency Services attended but he could not be resuscitated. At home he had left notes of farewell.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Multiple witnesses indicated that the Risk Assessment Tool on the online system (EPJS) is not used in line with policy (i.e. that a new assessment in that tool is undertaken at the time of each admission/discharge/major risk event etc.), and, if updated, may only be updated in so far as additional narrative is added to the last such narrative in a previously completed assessment. Further, the evidence was that rather than be used for a detailed assessment per the indicators set out in the tool at the time of each relevant event, it was reviewed to instead access any past assessment in order (only) to establish quickly a benchmark against which the gauge a patient's current presentation when considering their risks. The detailed indicators informing the risk assessment were not updated. Although it was submitted that patient risk was nonetheless assessed and recorded in the EPJS, and acknowledged that benchmarking/comparison is useful, I am concerned that: (1) if the risk indicators set out in the tool are not systematically reviewed or reconsidered, then the assessment of risk that follows will then be based on incomplete, and therefore misleading, information; and (2) absent the above, and dating of revisions within a compound document, it is not clear on what indicators any assessment is in fact based (3) to the extent the risk assessment is used as a benchmarking tool, the impression given to the most recent viewer is then likely to be incomplete and misleading; (4) the apparent current use of the tool to establish a point of benchmarking/comparison is in any event lost where the compound narrative assessments are not clearly dated and signposted ; (5) if the detailed patient assessment is instead placed as a new entry in the general chronological notes, the usefulness of the tool as a clear, well signposted, dated assessment and documentation of the patients of risk(s), is lost, requiring a reviewer to instead review the general chronological log of entries on the EPJS where it is not required to be articulated in the same terms, and may be more difficult to identify in a longstanding patient. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18 May 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion: Conrad Colson took his own life whilst suffering from severe body dysmorphic disorder. At the time of his death, he was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatments; he was not receiving a therapeutic level of medication and he was not in receipt of any professional mental health support for his body dysmorphic disorder. He had been discharged from mental health services without any robust risk assessment and without the safety net of a fully considered risk management/relapse plan.","Conrad Colson suffered from severe body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). The symptoms from this condition had led to a serious suicide attempt in February 2020. In 2021, following several months on the waiting list, Conrad received highly specialised therapy from the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma (CADAT). He made significant progress in managing his BDD symptoms during this therapy, however there was a known risk of relapse. He completed the sessions with his CADAT therapist in November 2021. Before and during this therapy, he had also received support from his local mental health trust's Peer Open Dialogue Team. As he had made such good progress with CADAT and as he had requested discharge from the Peer Open Dialogue Team, he was also discharged from this team in November 2021. There was no joint multi-disciplinary risk assessment and risk management plan on discharge from the teams. The practitioners were aware that Conrad was not taking a therapeutic dose of medication at the time of discharge, but no medical review was arranged for him. At the time of discharge from services, Conrad was also accessing treatment from an aesthetic dermatology clinic. This was not taken into account in his discharge risk assessment. Conrad had raised concerns with the skin clinic about his skin and the treatment, in December 2020; January 2021; March and April 2021. On the 27 and 28 February 2022, Conrad again raised concerns about the appearance of his skin, following treatment at the aesthetic dermatology clinic. His friends became concerned for his welfare when they could not reach him on the 2 March 2022. Emergency services attended and sadly Conrad was found deceased within his home address. The evidence at the inquest revealed that Conrad took his own life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. A concern arose at the Inquest hearing in relation to the absence of liaison between the highly specialist services of the CADAT team and the stepdown 3 services provided by NELFT. There was a lack of full information sharing around risk and joint risk assessment/risk management planning on discharge. 2. Both mental health services were aware that Conrad was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatment. There was a concern that neither service adequately highlighted the risks of accessing such treatment to Conrad or attempted to share information with the skin clinic. The inquest heard that patients with BDD should be fully informed of the risks of seeking aesthetic dermatology treatment and wherever possible, clinics who are providing treatment should be made aware of the BDD diagnosis. 3. The Inquest heard that there is a need for training to be provided to step-down service teams in relation to the diagnosis of BDD and the risks associated with it. 4. The inquest heard that there is a lack of national resources for BDD. The highly specialised service at South London and Maudsley has a very long waiting list (several months). This is on a background of concerns of a likely increase in BDD. In light of this concern, I am also providing this report to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, to the Department for Health & Social Care and to NHSE. 6"

Medical Cause of Death 1a Multiple Traumatic Injuries How, when and where and, for investigations where section 5(2) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 applies, in what circumstances the deceased came by his or her death. Shortly after 9am on 2 September 2020, Samuel Thomas Howes suffered fatal injuries when he jumped in front of a train [REDACTED] He did so in the following circumstances: a) Samuel suffered from ongoing mental health issues including anxiety and depression. b) Samuel's mental health led to his use of drugs and dependency which exacerbated his poor mental health. c) Samuel was a looked-after child, living in a placement residence. d) That he was free to, and did, leave that residence e) That early on 2 September 2020, he was recorded by police as being a 'missing person' f) That police did not succeed in finding him before he jumped in front of the train Below are also matters admitted by interested persons: a) Following Samuel's arrest on 30 August 2023, neither of the safeguarding forms (specifically, a CYP and a DASH form) was completed by officers of the British Transport Police (BTP) b) The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) did not request Samuel be assessed by healthcare professionals (in particular a Custody Nurse Practitioner or a member of the Liaison and Diversion Team) while in custody on 30-31 August 2020. c) The MPS did not progress the investigation to locate Samuel after 3:15pm on 2 September 2020 and before actions were set at 08:04am on 2 September 2020.","A jury found: Suicide Samuel's mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death. We believe that the following matters also possibly made more than minimal, trivial or negligible contributions to his death a) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the possibility of a rehabilitative placement. There were inadequate provisions for Samuel's complex needs. In particular, it was noted that no alternative treatments were proactively pursued. The agencies identified Covid as an obstacle to justify their inadequate responses. b) The failure to inadequately share risk information by Social Services and/or Mental Health Services with each other, and with the police. A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Missing risk assessments were not completed consistently • The Grab Pack was not completed • iii) Samuel's vulnerabilities and suicide notes were not adequately communicated to the police by Social Services c) The sharing of risk information by the MPS and/or BTP with partner agencies. A number of factors were noted in this regard: • There was a failure to share risk information by the MPS with BTP, as well as with partner agencies. • In particular, there was a failure to complete and update the CYP Fonns, or Merlin, as a result of each agency using their own platfonn. • In addition, the BTP did not access the PNC to identify Samuel's Warning Markers d) Steps taken by the MPS to seek an assessment of Samuel's mental health by a Liaison and Diversion Practitioner whilst he was in custody on 30 and 31 August 2020 The following was noted in this regard: • Actions noted on THRIVE regarding the provision of a mental health assessment for Samuel were not followed up on multiple occasions. e) The inadequate approach of staff and the safeguarding processes within Croydon Custody Suite A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Samuel's actions were regarded as 'attention-seeking'. • The DASH and CYP Fonns were not completed. • The limited collaboration between the MPS and BTP led to a lack of recognition of Samuel's mental health needs, resulting in inadequate care. f) Failures by multiple agencies and the inadequate response to the 'missing persons' investigation conducted by the MPS A number of factors were noted in this regard: • Failure to share infonnation by different agencies • Failure by multiple agencies to contact Samuel's family when he went missing. g) Samuel's interactions with his girlfriends The following was noted in this regard: • Samuel's relationships were described as 'chaotic' and this impacted on his mental health and his behaviour • In particular, the texts from his girlfriends telling him to 'kill himself as well as the threats by another girlfriend to end her life, had a significant impact on Samuel's behaviour.","During the course of the investigation, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN (some of which overlap) are as follows:

(1) Samuel's case should be a stimulus for some level of Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service reflection on how different Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service teams are organised and work together.

(2) The delayed response of the Adult Complex Additions Service to referral and issues related to provision of care to adolescents presenting with mental health vulnerabilities and substance use difficulties.

(3) The lack of a complex service providing, to adolescents, treatment for both substance misuse and mental health issues models, in terms of willingness to engage, being problematic for some young people.

(4) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the provision of a rehabilitative placement.

(5) Samuel's mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death."

The investigation concluded on the 24th November 2021 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a hanging,"Michelle Louise Jennings had a history of contact with mental health services and had a history of indicating suicidal ideation to a number of agencies. She was assessed as being suitable for step 4 therapy. However at the time of the assessment of her need there was a 2 year waiting list to access therapy. On the balance of probabilities this delay possibly contributed to her death. On 11th April 2019, 17th July 2019, 28th July 2019, 17th January 2020 and 8th May 2020 she was dealt with by British Transport Police (BTP) and indicated suicidal thoughts. Following the incident on 8th May 2020 BTP prosecuted her for obstructing the railways when she had indicated she had suicidal ideation at the time she was on the railway. She was subsequently arrested on a warrant and held in custody before being sentenced. On the balance of probabilities this decision to prosecute possibly contributed to the deterioration in her mental health and her subsequent death. On 1st August 2020 following calls to the mental health crisis line she was referred for a mental health assessment by the Primary Care Mental Health Team (PCMHT) part of Cheshire & Wirral partnership NHS Trust (CWP). On 3rd September 2020 she was assessed by telephone by the PCMHT and then the case was referred to the PCMHT MDT. On 6th September she rang Cheshire Police from Delamere Forrest with suicidal thoughts. She was taken to Hospital and discharged the following day. On 9th September 2020 her case was considered by the PCMHT MDT. They determined her needs were too complex for the PCMHT and she was to be referred to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) part of CWP. The referral was not made until 16th September 2020. At the point of referral she was discharged from the PCMHT caseload. On 17th September 2020 she presented at Stepping Hill Hospital with suicidal thoughts. She was assessed by mental health services and discharged. On 23rd September 2020 she was discussed at the CMHT MDT where the referral was rejected and she was to be referred back to the PCMHT. She was discharged from the CMHT caseload at that point. She was no longer on the caseload of either the PCMHT or the CMHT. Despite the complexity of her needs and her deteriorating mental health there was no discussion between the PCMHT and the CMHT in relation as to how to manage or mitigate the risk at this point although it was documented that she felt rejected by mental health services. On the balance of probabilities the poor communication between the PCMHT and the CMHT, the failure to assess risk effectively to ensure she remained on the caseload of either the PCMHT or the CMHT probably contributed to the further decline in her mental health and her death. On 3rd October 2020 she made her way [REDACTED] and hanged herself [REDACTED] She was found on 5th October 2020.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest heard evidence that the backlogs for therapy were such that the waiting list at the time she was assessed as being appropriate for step 4 therapy had a two year wait time. Since that time the waiting period had not decreased and was now between 2 -3 years in both primary and secondary care. This was due to a shortage of trained therapists and demands on the service and was a national issue not specific to the CWP trust. 2. The inquest was told that the trust had since Michelle's death recognised that the lack of ownership created through the application of its referral and discharge policy internally carried an unacceptable risk. Significant changes had been made. However it was unclear if nationally the lesson had been shared and that other mental health trusts had taken similar steps. 3. The evidence before the inquest was that there needed to be a clear understanding by all prosecuting authorities of the impact of a prosecution on someone with a complex mental health background such as Michelle. In Michelle's case the BTP file reviewer (the nature of the offence Michelle faced meant that it was not a CPS lawyer who made the charging decision) had not correctly applied the public interest test and had not considered the mental health/vulnerability of Michelle Jennings as required to. As a consequence a decision was taken to prosecute her without an assessment of the impact on Michelle and her case was dealt 3 with by the Magistrates Court without them being given the full background in relation to her deteriorating mental health. BTP are as a consequence of Michelle's death taking steps to address how their prosecution teams should deal with the public interest test and gather information where mental health is an issue. However there is no clear mechanism for such learning and changes (to reduce the risk to life) in relation to vulnerable people such as Michelle to be implemented within the other 42 Police Forces in England and Wales or within other agencies responsible for prosecuting criminal offences. 6

The Rt Hon Alex Chalk KC MP, Minister of Justice. 1","On 30th June 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Gregory Price. An inquest was concluded on 30 January 2024. The conclusion of the Inquest was that Mr Price died of multiple injuries, with a short-form conclusion of suicide being recorded.","Matthew Gregory Price was aged 48. He was convicted of a s.18 assault by wounding in 2010 when he was aged 35 and has been subject to an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection ('IPP'). He served a term of imprisonment before being released back into the community. Whilst IPP sentences were abolished in 2012, Mr Price remained subject to his sentence which was imposed in 2010. At the time of his death, Mr Price had engaged legal support in order to make an application for review of his sentence which was at an early stage. Since 2022, a review is initiated at the ten-year mark and yearly thereafter, if appropriate. Mr Price's first ten- year review was due to take place in November 2023. At the conclusion of the inquest, I recorded the following facts. 'On the evening of 16 June 2023 Matthew Gregory Price was struck by a train travelling from Leeds to Manchester at Cottingley Railway Station, Cottingley Drive, Cottingley [REDACTED]. He suffered multiple injuries and his death was confirmed by paramedics at 2149 hours. Matthew's mental well-being had been adversely affected over a significant period of time by the continuing impact of serving an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection (IPP). He was especially anxious that seeking help in respect of his mental health could impact negatively when making an application to discharge the sentence further to its imposition in 2010. It is apparent from a text message sent just prior to his death that Matthew intended to take his own life'","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. It was apparent from the evidence that I heard and read at the inquest that there are serious concerns about the welfare of individuals who remain subject to IPP sentences. For example, the Independent Monitoring Boards ('IMB') completed a report with key findings entitled 'The impact of IPP sentences on prisoners' wellbeing' in May 2023. This report was written following the rejection by the government of the recent Justice Select 2 Committee's recommendation for a re-sentencing exercise to take place for anyone serving an IPP sentence. Whilst the key findings of the IMB report are focused upon the impact upon serving prisoners and the prevention of recall, I was deeply concerned about the evidence I heard in relation to the clear impact that the on-going IPP sentence had had on Mr Price. He had served a three year tariff and at the time of his death he had been released back into the community for nearly ten years Mr Price was anxious about the ever-present potential for recall to prison. Furthermore, he had conveyed in communications to others that he felt that seeking help with his mental health by way of support and medication might count against him when seeking to be successful in discharging the IPP. Whilst Mr Price was engaged with legal support in navigating the review process, the on-going impact of uncertainty of being on an IPP sentence was clearly apparent. As a consequence of undertaking Mr Price's inquest, the on-going wellbeing of those serving IPP sentences, be that in prison estate or in the community, is a matter of concern to me as a Coroner. The Ministry of Justice is fully apprised of the IPP context and whilst matters have been raised by the IMB I am concerned that specific focus upon the welfare of individuals living in the community should be appraised by those who may be able to take appropriate steps to further support an evidently vulnerable section of society, 6"

South West London and St George's Mental Health Trust","On 12 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Judith Maike OBHOLZER. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: Judith Maike Obholzer died on 12 July 2023 at [REDACTED] from injuries caused from jumping in front of a moving train (suicide) following a significant period of worsening depressive illness for which she was receiving treatment. Delays by the Wandsworth SPA team in assessment and to being added to the waiting list for a full assessment by a Consultant, and the private psychiatrist not being able to directly access crisis support may have contributed to the death.","Mrs Obholzer took her own life by jumping in front of a moving train at [REDACTED] Train Station on 12 July 2023. From at least March 2023 Mrs Obholzer was suffering from depression and anxiety. She was receiving treatment through her GP in the form of antidepressants and had attended weekly Cognitive Behavioural Treatment (CBT) since 12 March 2023 with a private practitioner. Mrs Obholzer was referred to Wandsworth SPA team by her GP on 15 May 2023 and assessed by a triage nurse on 18 May. I found that there was a delay within the Wandsworth team following the initial triage assessment which led to a delay in Mrs Obholzer being put on the waiting list for assessment by a consultant psychiatrist, but that given the waiting times at that stage it was unclear whether or not she would have been assessed by the time of her death (as she had triaged as being a routine patient). She was not put on the waiting list for assessment by a consultant psychiatrist until 10 July. Throughout, Mrs Obholzer was experiencing thoughts of suicide and planning. Due to the deterioration in her condition and the wait for NHS care, Mrs Obholzer attended a consultation with a private consultant psychiatrist on 11 July 2023. The private consultant psychiatrist diagnosed her as suffering from severe post natal depression and presenting with significant suicidal risk. He recommended informal admission to a private hospital, but Mrs Obholzer was against this due to financial concerns. The private consultant psychiatrist planned to write to Mrs Obholzer's GP to request an urgent assessment by her local Home Treatment/Crisis resolution team, but that letter was not sent on that day for a variety of reasons. The private consultant psychiatrist gave evidence that he was not able to refer Mrs Obholzer to those teams directly. Following a post mortem examination the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1a Multiple Traumatic Injuries","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

1. In the course of the evidence it was confirmed that there is a significant pressure on NHS mental health services. It seems likely that there will be an increase in patients obtaining private support while waiting for NHS support (and often only being able to afford such support for a limited time and to a limited extent and doing so only while waiting for NHS support), as happened in this case. Consideration should be given to ensuring that there is sufficient clarity in processes such as referrals and crisis support where private practitioners are providing treatment as well as the NHS, ensuring sharing of information and notes where relevant and necessary and ensuring that the NHS provision is not assessed as unnecessary simply because someone has obtained private support as an interim measure.
2. In the course of the evidence the private consultant psychiatrist gave evidence that he was unable to refer patients directly to NHS provided crisis teams as a direct alternative to informal treatment at a private hospital. The evidence from the South West London and St George's Mental Health Trust was that direct referrals can be made although the evidence on the exact mechanism was unclear. In Mrs Obholzer's case, the (apparent) lack of ability of the private consultant psychiatrist to directly refer to the crisis team meant that she did not receive the community crisis support alternative to hospital admission that she required. Consideration should be given to ensuring that the pathway for urgent/crisis referrals from private practitioners to the NHS are clear to all (both for this area and throughout the country) and, if it is not already the case, to ensuring a process that allows private practitioners to arrange crisis support through the NHS directly.
3. In the course of the evidence it was confirmed that the private consultant psychiatrist was unable to send the urgent letter to Mrs Obholzer's GP in part because their details had not been provided. Consideration should be given to ensuring that all medical practitioners (private and NHS) can access GP registration details for patients and GP contact details to avoid delays where there is an urgent need to contact a person's GP.
4. In the course of the evidence it was confirmed that there is no sharing of medical notes between private practitioners and NHS providers. This (along with other factors) led to delays in a treatment plan being set by Wandsworth SPA as they had to obtain further details regarding Mrs Obholzer's CBT from Mrs Obholzer rather than being able to access the notes through a shared system. Consideration should be given to ensuring a system is in place to allow the sharing of medical information between practitioners across Trusts and also between NHS and Private providers."

He had been suffering with mental health issues for several years. Having considered the evidence, on the balance of probabilities we have identified the following contributing factors – 1) The decision to close the police log on the 25th August 2023 and the police not attending Michael resulted in a missed opportunity for a welfare check, 2) Poor inter agency communication and failures to follow up any outstanding action points, in particular the failure of the Trafford North West Mental Health team to chase up the date when Michael was due to return from Gibraltar and investigate the blank email with Michael's identifier. In addition, the failure of Trafford Council Adult Social Care to verify that police were attending on the 25th August 2023. 3) The failure of mental health services in Gibraltar to notify Trafford Mental Health Team of the exact date of Michael's return to the United Kingdom. This resulted in a lack of mental health support when he returned. 4) The lack of probing by North West Ambulance Service mental health practitioner during telephone triage on 23rd August 2023 resulted in a missed opportunity for a face to face assessment. 5) Michael's mental health condition and his reluctance to take his psychiatric medication consistently and his reluctance to engage with mental health services or General practitioner.","The evidence heard during the inquest into Michael Sean Heath's death and the findings of the jury confirmed there were a number of factors contributing to Michael's death which are of concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows - In relation to Policing is the extent to which all officers are trained to assess the increasing number of calls to the police which are of a mental health nature, the risks associated with the consequences of not making the right assessment where there may be an immediate risk to life and when to accept that the police are the right agency to be involved in mantal health related enquiries due to their powers of entry; In relation to the management of mental health patients that their carers are made aware of any admission under the Mental Health Act within 24 hours and those patients are supported with access to an independent mental health advocate; The apparent lack of connectivity between mental health services abroad and the UK upon repatriation whilst the patient remains ill; That there is a risk to patients generated by a decision to remove a patient from a GP practice list where the patient resides out of geographical area for that GP practice without considering the wider circumstances and the likely follow on care; and The means of communication is known and agreed between all mental health agencies to ensure all relevant patient information is held in an accessible central repository. 6"

Chief Executive, London Borough of Camden Council, 5 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG 1","On 6 October 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Sandra Elizabeth SENIOR, then aged 58 years. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, heard by me, on 28 February 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical cause of death being: 1a multiple traumatic injuries","On 24 September 2023, Sandra Senior travelled to central London. While there she gained access to Tavistock Chambers, Bloomsbury, WC1A; a building comprising of commercial units on the ground floor, with four floors of residential accommodation above. [REDACTED] completed suicide [REDACTED]","During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) The London Borough of Camden Council is the Freeholder of Tavistock Chambers. I learned in evidence from local witnesses and officers from the Metropolitan Police Service that Miss Senior's death, as a result of using to complete suicide, was the second of its type within approximately 18-months. The evidence from a resident of one of the flats in Tavistock Chambers set out that the only access to the residential part of the building is through a door , which has “a secure key fob entry system”. However, the evidence was that “We have constant issues with this front entrance either not locking or not opening with the key, there is also a latch to hook the door open at times”. The witness confirmed that the front entrance was hooked open at the material time; this was confirmed by photographic evidence provided by the Metropolitan Police Service. There was also evidence that approximately a year prior to the events of 24 September 2023, “Camden Council locked the only access .” The witness had assumed that it remained bolted and locked. However, other evidence, including photographic evidence from the Metropolitan Police Service, showed that although there was a clear 'no entry' sign , it was not locked shut. A statement from a Detective Sergeant revealed, “A yellow padlock was locked onto the sliding bolt, to give an illusion it was locked, however the clasp had not been held down into the lock, so it could have been opened by any person.” It was also established in evidence that Miss Senior did know any of the residents of Tavistock Chambers or in the vicinity generally. As such, it appeared that her entry to the building was entirely opportunistic. However, that aside, the evidence suggested that both of the safety systems installed to prevent unauthorised access to the building were not working effectively at that time. The concern is that it appears that the safety systems in place to stop unauthorised access in particular, were not operating/being used effectively at the material time and the evidence suggests that this may have been commonplace. 6"

Kellie died on 26 August 2017 in Lister Hospital. She was 30 years old. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 06 July 2023. The medical cause of death was 1a) features consistent with hanging. The jury recorded a short form conclusion of unlawful killing and a narrative conclusion as follows: After being subjected to months of controlling and coercive behaviour and domestic abuse by her then partner, on the morning of 23rd August 2017 Kellie Sutton hung herself [REDACTED] She was treated at the scene by ambulance staff and HEMS before being conveyed to the Lister Hospital. Her injuries were not survivable and she died at 2.30pm on 26th August 2017 in the hospital. The jury found that there were certain failures or inadequacies by Herfordshire Constabulary which may have contributed to Kellie Sutton ' s death, but not that they did: see Annex A – Determination sheet.","Kellie Sutton had experienced a series of relationships from a young age with abusive men in the past. She had 3 children. Kellie met her final partner in March 2017 and he moved in to her home [REDACTED] where she lived with two of her children in a shared custody arrangement. There was extensive and detailed witness evidence gathered by the police for criminal proceedings which demonstrated that Kellie ' s partner was abusive towards her: both physically violent on at least several occasions and by his controlling and coercive behaviour towards her, which included shouting, threatening, phoning constantly if she was out, isolating her from her family and friends and holding her bank card. She lived in fear of her phone battery dying because if he couldn ' t get hold of her he would “ go mad ” and would become violent. In March 2018, i.e. after her death, Kellie ' s partner was convicted of controlling and coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship, contrary to s76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015, the offence taking place between 1 March 2017 and 24 August 2017. He was also convicted of one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the offence taking place on 3rd June 2017 and one count of common assault which occurred on 9 July 2017. I am satisfied from the evidence, which included text messages from Kellie to friends and from Kellie to her partner that Kellie was very unhappy in this relationship but did not feel able to extricate herself from it, even though her friends were telling her he was abusive. On 9 July 2017 a neighbour called the police on the basis that Kellie was being “ beaten up by her partner ” . The police came very quickly and spoke to Kellie and her partner separately but the couple told them that they had just had a verbal argument. A risk assessment in the form of the DASH book was completed which resulted in 6 ticks and the police took the view that this was a ' standard risk ' case and the matter was closed as a non-crime incident. The police did not speak to the neighbour who called 999 and who was in possession of significant further information about the incident, including that one of the children had witnessed it. In a witness statement for the inquest the police accepted, at a senior level, that the response fell below the expected standard in a number of respects, including body worn video capability, the failure to check up on the children and that they showed a lack of professional curiosity and judgment relating to the DASH process and house to house inquiries not being completed. The controlling and coercive behaviour continued. Over the night of 22/23 August 2017, there were a series of exchanges both verbally and by text message which continued after Kellie ' s partner left for work at 650 a.m. This showed a series of increasingly distressed messages from Kellie culminating in her threatening to hang herself to which he had responded with words to the effect of ' do everyone a favour ' . Very shortly thereafter she stopped answering the phone, he rushed home and found her hanging [REDACTED] , at about 810 a.m. Despite him administering CPR to her and the ambulance arriving shortly thereafter, tests showed that she had suffered irrecoverable brain injury from lack of oxygen and brain stem death was confirmed on 26 August 2017 when she was pronounced dead. The inquest jury found that although they were not satisfied that the lack of further investigation or action on 9 July 2017 did contribute to Kellie Sutton ' s death, they found that it may have led to further interventions that could have altered the final outcome on 23 August 2017. The jury also found that numerous opportunities were missed at several levels to recognise the significance of the responses in the DASH and that this in turn led to a failure to consider implementation of appropriate protective measures, which could have included issuing a DVPN and/or applying Clare ' s law. However, they concluded that they could not be satisfied that these failings did contribute to Kellie Sutton ' s death, although they may have contributed to her death. During the course of the inquest the court heard evidence from an expert in the field of violence against women and girls about the harms of controlling and coercive behaviour and abuse, the feelings of entrapment by victims meaning it was very common for a victim to be unable to extricate themselves and the higher incidence of suicide in victims of abuse: one third of all suicides in England and Wales are preceded by domestic abuse. The court heard that an understanding of controlling and coercive behaviour was key to any risk assessment and that it was important to understand that no physical assault was required. The evidence at the inquest indicated a lack of awareness of the link between domestic abuse and suicide. Whilst officers did have an awareness of the ' harm ' from others through domestic abuse, a heightened awareness of the risk of ' harm ' by taking one ' s own life was relevant to a risk assessment and the consequential steps which may be required. The evidence at the inquest also appeared to reveal a lack of understanding by front line officers of the circumstances in which a DVPN could be applied for, and whether it was necessary for an individual to have been subject to arrest prior to triggering a referral to the DAISU I am of the view that this lack of understanding, notwithstanding training which had been provided, was evident and created a risk of future deaths. The court heard about the lack of systems available at the time to easily identify serial perpetrators of abuse. However, I accept the evidence from the Constabulary about the changes that have already been made and further developments that are on-going. Accordingly this element does not form one of my elements of concern.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. There was a lack of understanding of controlling and coercive behaviour, what it is, and the impact on victims. 2. There was a lack of awareness of the link between domestic abuse and suicide. 3. There was a lack of understanding by front line officers of the circumstances in which a DVPN could be applied for, and whether it was necessary for an individual to have been subject to arrest prior to triggering a referral to the DAISU. 6"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 August 2024. On 25 th December 2020 Ms Nalubowa suspended herself with a ligature, whilst an inpatient at the St Pancras Hospital in King's Cross. She was successfully resuscitated but sustained an hypoxic brain injury from which she subsequently died. The jury returned a conclusion of Misadventure, and found as follows in Box 3: Death by hanging [REDACTED] The medical cause of death was 1a Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 1b Asphyxiation by hanging 1c Severe major depression","(1) Immediately prior to her detention the Deceased had been living in Stockton in the North of England (near Middlesbrough). (2) However she was now divorced with few ties to that area. (3) Moreover, importantly, concerns had been raised that the ex-partner in question was abusive. (4) The Deceased's family and support network was in London and not Stockton. (5) Returning to Stockton was a source of great anxiety for the Deceased. She commented that she would “rather die than return to Middlesbrough [sic]”. (6) It was clear to treating clinicians that securing the right accommodation was paramount to her mental health prognosis and to her future more generally. (7) It was clear to treating clinicians that surrounding the Deceased with a positive supportive network of family was crucial in maintaining mental health. (8) Despite all of the above, the existing framework/rules were such that all London boroughs, correctly applying the relevant criteria, rejected the Deceased's applications for accommodation in London. (9) The witness evidence was clear that there was no “discretion” and that London Boroughs and treating clinicians alike were powerless. The Deceased was therefore discharged to Stockton, against her wishes, against medical advice, away from her support network, and to an area where she would have to at best face her demons and at worst be in physical danger. (10) Shortly after being told she was being discharged to Stockton, the Deceased suspended herself using a ligature.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Please see Box 4, above. The evidence at the Inquest was that this situation is not uncommon, with those detained under the MHA not infrequently having social circumstances such that their historical place of residency is, for whatever reason, deeply inappropriate (or even dangerous). It should be noted that section 117 Mental Health Act 1983 did not apply. I am concerned that the rigidity and lack of flexibility in the criteria, coupled with the evidence this is a not uncommon phenomenon, gives rise to a risk of future deaths in cases which do not meet the threshold for aftercare under s.117. Consideration should be given to giving decision makers greater latitude / discretion or the power to apply common sense, in circumstances where (a) it is foreseeable that rigid adherence to criteria will lead to personal injury (including psychiatric injury) and/or serious emotional harm (b) there is an obvious alternative solution, such as accommodation near family. 6"
