An inquest into Mr Bradley's death was opened on 28 th July 2023 and his inquest was heard before me on 19 th May 2025. The medical cause of Mr Bradley's death was: 1a. Pressure on the neck 1b. Hanging It was discovered in toxicology testing that the level of Venlafaxine in his blood was around twenty times that expected from a therapeutic dose and in the range associated with fatality. A narrative conclusion was given: “Dean Bradley hanged himself on the morning of 15 th October 2021 in [REDACTED], Stockton on Tees whilst under the influence of excess amount of prescribed medication. The police failed to contact the mental health services when they assisted him at Thornaby station earlier in the day and failed to adequately relay details of his mental health crisis to staff at the hostel. The staff at the hostel failed to respond to information provided by the police. There were missed opportunities by both Cleveland Police and the hostel to involve mental health professionals and secure appropriate mental health support for Dean.”","At approximately 0300 on 15 th October 2021 Mr Bradley was found by the police walking on a dual carriageway. Following a discussion in which he revealed he was homeless the police secured emergency overnight housing for him at a hostel. There were no concerns for Mr Bradley's mental health at that point. Mr Bradley was seen outside the hostel at 0450 and was met by the security officer. He spoke of people being after him. He was reassured and taken back to his flat. Mr Bradley left the hostel unwitnessed by the security officer. At 0540 a member of the public came across Mr Bradley sat on a bridge over a railway line. Mr Bradley stated he intended to kill himself. The member of the public spoke with Mr Bradley and called the police. During his time with the member of the public Mr Bradley moved himself as if to jump in front of a train when he thought a train was coming. The police attended. The police succeeded in bringing Mr Bradley down from the bridge and spoke with him in the police van. The officers came to the conclusion that Mr Bradley was under the influence of drugs. One of the officers raised concerns about Mr Bradley's mental health as he was expressing persecutory beliefs and appeared paranoid and delusional. He believed that people were chasing him and wanted to kill him. The police considered contacting the Crisis Team and other mental health services but did not do so. The main reason for this is that, in their shared experience, the mental health services would tell them to safeguard Mr Bradley until he was sufficiently sober to be assessed. The police returned Mr Bradley to the hostel and, with the assistance of the security officer, Mr Bradley was shown CCTV of the premises. The purpose of showing Mr Bradley the CCTV was to prove no one was chasing him. Mr Bradley reportedly relaxed and accepted that no one was pursuing him. The police determined that the risk of suicide and self-harm had lessened and that it was safe and appropriate to leave Mr Bradley at the hostel. The police did not adequately relay the circumstances in which they found Mr Bradley to the security officer at the hostel. There was a brief comment that he was found sitting on the edge of a bridge at the station. The security officer did not enquire further. The security officer saw Mr Bradley leave his flat at approx. 0720. Mr Bradley refers to people being after him again. The security officer met with Mr Bradley, reassured him and took him back to his flat. Staff from the hostel knocked on Mr Bradley's door at approx. 1015 as he had not left the flat. There was no response. Police attended and Mr Bradley as found deceased, hanging in his flat. The staff from the hostel were clear that the hostel was not a place for a person suffering from a mental health crisis. Residents are not checked upon, it is a service which provides accommodation only. Evidence was received from a Detective Chief Inspector who concurred. He also gave evidence as to Right Care Right Person initiative. He spoke of Crisis Cafes and Calming Centres in other regions where people who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol and present with metal health concerns may be supervised pending a mental health assessment. There appears to be a gap in the services available for people in this category. The officer spoke of a discussion with Middlesbrough County Council about provision of such a service. I stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Bradley's death and the unavailability of this resource. Neither the local authorities in this jurisdiction, the Integrated Care Board (NHS North East & North Cumbria), Tees Esk and Wear Valley NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust nor the Department of Health were Interested Persons in the inquest. They did not give evidence at the inquest as the concerns raised did not come to light until the hearing.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 This document was classified as: OFFICIAL The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1) Current resources for safeguarding those with mental health illnesses whilst intoxicated may be placing people at risk. 2) I heard evidence that a person who was suicidal, suffering with mental health concerns and was intoxicated could not be adequately safeguarded until he was sufficiently sober to allow a mental health assessment. 6","Mr Dean Bradley died by hanging on 15 October 2021 while under the influence of a toxic level of Venlafaxine. Earlier that day, police found him in a mental health crisis but did not contact mental health services, partly due to past experiences that such services would only assess once the individual was sober. Police returned Mr Bradley to a hostel, but failed to fully communicate his mental health state to hostel staff, who were not equipped to manage mental health crises and only provided accommodation. Despite signs of distress and suicidal intent, there were missed opportunities by both police and hostel staff to involve mental health professionals. The coroner identified concerns that current resources do not adequately safeguard individuals with mental health issues who are intoxicated, highlighting a gap in services for this group and the risk of future deaths unless action is taken."

I found the cause of death to be: 1(a) Respiratory failure 1(b) Aspiration pneumonia 1(c) Choking episode II Fractured neck of femur (operated on 28.4.24) Coronary artery atherosclerosis.","I returned the following in box 4 of the Record of Inquest recorded: Mr Keith Ineson resided at the Glenroyd Care Home, 164 Whitegate Drive, Blackpool, FY3 9HF. It was known that Mr Ineson was at risk of suffering from falls and required an altered diet. On 26 April 2024, Mr Ineson was in the process of mobilising when he suffered an unwitnessed fall. The carer in attendance had left the room and upon their return, Mr Ineson was found on the floor. On 27 April 2024, Mr Ineson was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where he underwent a right hemiarthroplasty. On 3 May 2024, and following the right hip hemiarthroplasty surgery, Mr Ineson suffered a choking episode on food. Mr Ineson developed aspiration pneumonia and, despite treatment, Mr Inseon's condition deteriorated and he died on 6 May 2024 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Mr Keith Ineson was a resident at the Glenroyd Care Home from 6 June 2019. It was known to the Glenroyd Care Home that Mr Inseon was a high falls risk, and measures had been put in place to address this issue. Following the fall on 26 Aril 2024, I found that the senior carer who checked Mr Ineson for signs of injury had conducted an appropriate assessment. It was noted in the evidence, that the observation scores taken for Mr Ineson following his fall had not all been recorded in Mr Ineson's care notes. This left a gap in the evidence as to reviewing the need for escalation to medical services after the fall. I received from witnesses who gave evidence before me, helpful assistance concerning several issues about learning and changes that had been made following Mr Ineson's death. I could not identify changes to the record keeping system though, and as such found that the issue around the absence of recording observation scores following a fall gave rise to a risk of further death. This was because the record keeping was inaccurate, contained gaps in the information, and engaged my duty under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 6","Mr Keith Inseon, a resident at Glenroyd Care Home and known to be at high risk of falls and requiring an altered diet, suffered an unwitnessed fall on 26 April 2024. Following surgery for a fractured neck of femur at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, he experienced a choking episode on 3 May 2024, leading to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, resulting in his death on 6 May 2024. The inquest found that although a senior carer conducted an appropriate injury assessment after the fall, observation scores were not fully recorded in Mr Inseon's care notes, creating gaps in evidence and potentially delaying medical escalation. Despite some improvements made after his death, no changes were identified in the record-keeping system, posing a risk of future deaths due to inaccurate and incomplete documentation."

A forensic autopsy was conducted on 17 February 2024, and an investigation into the death was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest between 13 and 15 May 2025. The medical cause of death was 1a cold water immersion. A narrative conclusion of the inquest was that: Paul Andrew Alexander had a long-standing history of mental illness since December 1989. In July 2022 a consultant psychiatrist following review changed his primary diagnosis to paranoid schizophrenia with a secondary diagnosis of mental and behavioural disturbance due to the use of cannabinoids. At the time of his death, he received oral medication of Haloperidol 8 mg per day. On 4 February 2024 at 00.12 hours a call was made to police expressing concerns for Paul's welfare. Under the Right Care Right Person framework, the call was redirected to the ambulance service who did not attend as they did not have a location for Paul. No emergency services were dispatched. This represented a missed opportunity. However, it is not possible to determine whether Paul's death would have been avoided given the likelihood is that his death occurred shortly after entering the water at Aspley Marina at around 04.43 hours on 4 February 2024.","As identified above, Paul Alexander had a long-standing history of mental illness. At the time of his death, he was under the care of community mental health services who visited him regularly to monitor his compliance with taking his oral medication. The last contact prior to his death was on 29 January 2024 when his care coordinator visited Paul. No concerns were reported or noted. His care coordinator left Paul with a month's supply of Haloperidol. On 4 February 2024 at 00.12 hours a call was made to the police by a member of the public expressing concerns for Paul's welfare. Under the Right Care Right persons framework (RCRP) the call was redirected to the ambulance service who did not attend as the caller was unable to provide them with a location (contrary to information provided to the police in the initial call). The call was redirected back to the police. The caller became frustrated with being passed between the emergency services and terminated the call. No attempt was made to contact the caller again. As such no emergency services were dispatched. Subsequently, on 6 and 7 February 2024, following further calls to the police Paul was identified as a missing person, initially as a medium risk and then a high risk. On 14 February 2024, a body was discovered in the water at Aspley Marina, Huddersfield. This was subsequently identified as Paul. In the ensuing police investigation CCTV last identified Paul as being alive at around 04.43 hours on 4 February 2024 when he was seen running across a car park and down a flight of stairs towards the marina. He was not being chased and was observed on the CCTV to be behaving bizarrely. The conclusion was that he entered the water in the marina at that time and died as a consequence of cold-water immersion.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) In the course of the evidence, it became apparent the police had introduced RCRP in September 2023. RCRP is a police initiative arising out of a national agreement but to be implemented by individual police forces. Little or no consultation with other agencies had taken place prior to the implementation of RCRP in September 2023.Whilst I heard evidence that meetings with other agencies now do take place, the specifics of Paul's case and the broader issues it raises have not been discussed nor is there any understanding/ agreement in place as to how such a situation would now be addressed. As much as the court was advised was that if a similar situation arose today, there may be a discussion between operational managers in the respective police and ambulance call centres, but that this would be reliant upon the matter being brought to the attention of those respective managers by the call taker. The evidence from the RCRP lead at the ambulance service indicated the scenario that arose with Paul was not an isolated example. As such there appears to be a lacuna in how emergency services will respond to such a situation when it was accepted this was a call expressing concern for Paul's welfare. 6","Paul Andrew Alexander, who had a long history of mental illness including paranoid schizophrenia and was under community mental health care, died from cold water immersion after entering Aspley Marina on 4 February 2024. On the same day, a call expressing concern for his welfare was made to the police but was redirected to the ambulance service under the Right Care Right Person (RCRP) framework. The ambulance service did not attend due to lack of location information, and no emergency services were dispatched. The call was redirected back to the police, but the caller ended the call without further contact attempts. Paul was later reported missing and found deceased on 14 February 2024. The investigation highlighted concerns about the implementation of RCRP by West Yorkshire Police in September 2023, noting a lack of prior consultation with other agencies and no clear protocol for handling such welfare calls. It was acknowledged that similar situations have occurred, revealing a gap in emergency service responses to welfare concerns under the current framework."
3,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/abdirahman-afrah-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2025-0245,2025-05-27,Nadia Persaud,East London,", Chief Executive Officer, Barts Health NHS Foundation Trust Sent via email: Cc: 1","On the 13 June 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Abdirahman Abdirizaq Afrah, aged 17 at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 May 2025 with a conclusion of natural causes.","Abdirahman Afrah began to suffer from chest pain, associated with a cough, from the very early hours of the 3 June 2024. At around 2330 on the 3 June 2024 he attended Newham University Hospital A&E, on the direction of a NHS 111 clinical adviser. He notified the triage nurse of severe chest pain including pain radiating to the left arm and shoulder. He had a tachycardia of 130 beats per minute, but other vital signs were normal. An ECG was carried out which showed a sinus tachycardia and P pulmonale. Venous blood gases showed an abnormal base excess, indicating a compensated metabolic acidosis. Abdirahman was given two lots of painkillers whilst in the A&E department, but his pain continued to be severe. After around 3 hours of waiting, Abdirahman asked to lie down due to his level of pain. He was told that there were no beds available and that he would have to wait a further 4 hours or so. He notified the nurse that he would have to leave, to be able to lie down to relieve the pain. The nurse advised him that he could leave. He was not seen by a doctor before leaving the department. A doctor from A&E called him the following afternoon to tell him to return to the A&E department for a doctor to explain the results of the tests. He raised concerns about the waiting times and said that he was seeing his GP later the same afternoon. The importance of returning to hospital was not explained clearly to him. Abdirahman did attend his GP practice at around 1630 on 4 June 2024. He was seen by a physician's associate who did not have the hospital results available to her. Abdirahman was clinically stable at the consultation. He was advised by the physician's associate to return to the emergency department to discuss his results. It is unlikely that he was advised to return with any sense of urgency. At around 8pm on the 4 June 2024, Abdirahman suffered a collapse in his home address. Emergency services were called and he was urgently conveyed back to Newham University Hospital. Sadly, all life-saving efforts at this time were unsuccessful. Abdirahman's life was pronounced extinct at Newham University Hospital at 2145 on 4 June 2024. Abdirahman died as a result of bleeding caused by a pulmonary vascular malformation. There was a missed opportunity to provide further investigations and treatment to him when he attended hospital on the late evening of the 3 June 2024. The evidence did not however reveal that such investigation and treatment would, on the balance of probabilities, have prevented his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. The inquest heard that waiting times to be seen in Majors A&E at Newham University Hospital could sometimes be between 9 to 14 hours. Many patients are unable to tolerate such long waits and leave the department before being seen. 2. There was no timely triage of Majors patients by the medical team, to ensure that those with the greatest potential of clinical decline are picked up quickly and appropriate investigations commenced at an early stage. Without such frontloading of care, patients like Abdirahman who might compensate right up to the point of collapse, might be missed again. 3. When the doctor called Abdirahman the following afternoon, she did not have all of the relevant clinical information to hand. She was not aware of the compensated metabolic acidosis. It is unlikely that she advised Abdirahman of the importance of returning to the hospital. It is foreseeable that patients may be reticent to return to A&E, because of the lengthy waits, so doctors making the call to patients who have left, should be fully informed about the clinical condition and risks. The risk of not returning should be made very clear. 4. Abdirahman was 17 years old. He declined to return to A&E. There was no direct discussion with a responsible parent about the need to return to A&E. 5. When Abdirahman stated that he would be seeing his GP later that afternoon, he asked for the relevant results to be sent to the GP. Neither the results, nor the discharge summary were sent to the GP in time for the appointment. The inquest heard that the A&E doctor did not know how to share such information with the GP. 3 6","Abdirahman Abdirizaq Afrah, aged 17, died from bleeding caused by a pulmonary vascular malformation after attending Newham University Hospital A&E with severe chest pain on 3 June 2024. Despite abnormal test results indicating compensated metabolic acidosis, he was not seen by a doctor before leaving due to long waiting times and lack of available beds. A follow-up call from a doctor the next day lacked full clinical information and did not convey the urgency of his condition. Abdirahman saw a physician's associate at his GP practice later that day, but hospital results were not available, and he was not advised with urgency to return to hospital. He collapsed at home that evening and died despite emergency treatment. The inquest identified concerns including excessively long A&E waiting times, absence of timely triage to prioritise patients at risk of clinical decline, inadequate communication during follow-up calls, failure to involve a responsible parent in decisions for a minor, and poor information sharing between hospital and GP. These issues pose a risk of future deaths unless addressed."

Deputy Chief Constable , Durham Constabulary 2. Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing, 1","On 7 January 2025 an investigation into the death of Sophie Ann Louise Cotton, 24 was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical cause of death being pressure on the neck due to hanging.","The Deceased had a long history of mental health problems. These came to the fore in late 2024. The Deceased was under the care of mental health services both in the community and, for a short period of time, as a voluntary in-patient on a psychiatric ward. On 6 January 2025 the Deceased was due to attend an important meeting and when she did not turn up for that meeting there was serious concern for her welfare. Four calls were made to the police that day to request that they attend the Deceased's home address to check on her welfare. However, due to the “Right Care, Right Person” assessment, the police refused to attend. The first call was made by a social worker at 15:46, expressing concerns that: 1. The Deceased had not attended family contact with her children, which was very out of the ordinary. 2. There was no reply at the Deceased's home address, but the Deceased's dog was present inside. 3. The Deceased's phone was switched off. 4. None of the Deceased's family had a key to the property. 5. The Deceased had a history of mental health problems and had attempted suicide on numerous occasions. The “Right Care Right Person” decision was no. The social worker was advised by the call handler to ring the ambulance service. The call handler also said that they would speak to their supervisor for the decision to be reviewed. The second call was made by the Deceased's mother at 16:38. The call was made on the 999 number. The call handler asked the Deceased's mother if the Deceased had made a threat of suicide today and when the Deceased's mother said that she hadn't, the call handler advised the Deceased's mother to call back on 101. It was acknowledged at the inquest that it was not best practice to have asked the caller to call back on 101. The third call was made by the Deceased's mother (on the 101 number) at 16:44, expressing concerns that: 1. The Deceased had a history of mental ill-health and suicide attempts. 2. The Deceased was mean to attend family contact time that day and hadn't. The Deceased never missed family contact time. 3. No one had spoken to the Deceased since Saturday (4 January 2025). 4. Family had attended the house and the Deceased was not answering the door, but the dog was inside and the Deceased would not usually leave the dog alone for that long. 5. The same lights had been on in the property since Saturday (4 January 2025) and the deceased did not usually leave the lights on., 6. A chewed up teddy bear could be seen on the living room floor and the Deceased would not normally leave a chewed up teddy bear on the floor for fear that it would choke the dog. 7. The Deceased's phone was going straight to voicemail. 8. To the direct question of was there a real an immediate risk to the Deceased's life the Deceased's mother said yes, because the police have had to cut the deceased down before from previous suicide attempts. 9. The Deceased's mother informed the call handler of the police also attending suicide attempts at the train lines. 10. The Deceased had recently been reading court papers, which can cause her to spiral downwards. 11. The Deceased had previously attempted suicide with no warning The “Right Care Right Person” decision was no. The Deceased's mother was advised to call the Mental health Crisis team or NHS 111. The Deceased's mother said that the social worker had already contacted mental health services and that the social worker had advised the Deceased's mother to call the police to see if they could do a welfare check. The call handler said that the “Right Care, Right Person” decision was still no, but the decision would be reviewed by supervision. The fourth call was made by a social worker at 16:57, expressing concerns that: 1. The Deceased was vulnerable and over the past six months had attempted to end her life many times. 2. The Deceased was due to attend family contact time and had not turned up and she would never miss family contact time and this was really concerning. 3. The family had attended the Deceased's address and the dog was barking inside, but there was no sign of the Deceased. 4. The lack of contact was unusual, as often the Deceased would cry out for help and contact the Crisis team. 5. The police had had to break the door down previously to get in to cut the deceased down. The call handler said that she could not confirm if a welfare check would be done. Very shortly after this the Deceased's family forced entry into the Deceased's home address, and found the Deceased hanging by a ligature [REDACTED].","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) During the 16:44 call, by following the “Right Care, Right Person” procedure there was a refusal to the request that the police attend, even when a family member was expressing the view that there was a real and immediate risk to life. (2) During the 16:44 call the “Right Care, Right Person” advice to contact mental health services appears to have disregarded the fact that the mental health crisis team do not have the power to enter locked premises and so would require police attendance to facilitate entry to the premises. (3) During the 16:57 call there was no decision for police to attend, even though this was the third caller (and second professional caller) that had expressed serious concerns 3 about the Deceased. (4) Although there is a procedure in place to have a negative “Right Care, Right Person” decision reviewed by a supervisor, this causes additional delay in circumstances when attendance could be extremely time-sensitive. 6","Sophie Ann Louise Cotton, aged 24, with a history of mental health issues and previous suicide attempts, died by hanging on 7 January 2025. On that day, four calls were made to the police expressing serious concerns for her welfare after she missed an important meeting and was uncontactable. Despite these concerns, the police declined to attend her home following the “Right Care, Right Person” assessment. Callers included a social worker and the Deceased’s mother, who highlighted immediate risks and the need for a welfare check. The police advised contacting mental health services, which lacked authority to enter the property. The family eventually forced entry and found the Deceased deceased. The inquest identified concerns about the refusal to send police despite clear risks, the limitations of the “Right Care, Right Person” procedure, and delays caused by supervisory reviews, all of which may contribute to future preventable deaths."

You will see from the attached narrative that the jury concluded there was a failure by MPS to implement, disseminate and train relevant staff on relevant policies effectively. 2. Although the jury did not comment on this specifically, it seemed to me from the evidence in court that there was not a consistent expectation among police officers of how long it generally takes a police controller to make a decision on authorisation of a pursuit. Whilst I do not suggest there should be a time limit on this, it would seem helpful if the expectation of the timing of police control decision making were to be roughly aligned between those making the decisions (in the police control room) and those waiting for the decisions (in police cars involved in the pursuits). 6","Lewis Johnson, aged 18, died in a road traffic collision at Clapton Common, London, on 9 February 2016, following a police motorcycle pursuit. The inquest revealed concerns regarding the Metropolitan Police Service's failure to effectively implement, disseminate, and train staff on relevant pursuit policies. Additionally, there was inconsistency in expectations among officers about the time taken by police controllers to authorise pursuits, suggesting a need for better alignment between decision-makers in control rooms and officers involved in pursuits to reduce the risk of future deaths."

Obviously this omission did not have an impact upon Lewis Johnson's death, but it did have an impact upon the inquest. It meant that the jury had no clear objective evidence about the distance between his motor cycle and the police car behind. Given that learning and at times policy are informed by such findings, it appears that this would be helpful to include in future investigations when death follows a police pursuit. 6","Lewis Johnson, aged 18, died in a road traffic collision on 9 February 2016 at Clapton Common, London, following a police pursuit while riding a motorcycle with a pillion passenger.

Specifically, the terms of reference for the forensic collision investigator did not include measuring the distance between the pursuing police vehicle and Johnson's motorcycle at points where they appeared close. This omission did not affect the cause of death but limited the evidence available to the jury and may impact future learning and policy. It is recommended that future investigations into deaths following police pursuits include such measurements to provide clearer objective evidence."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 14 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was an open inquest, as the cause of Mr Fraser's death was unascertained.","Mr. Fraser was a 37-year-old gentleman who had suffered from schizophrenia, hypothyroidism and misuse of alcohol. He required admission to a mental health hospital under a section of the Mental Health Act from 20 February 2024 to 18 March 2024. On discharge, he received very regular input from the Home Treatment Team until 9 May 2024, when he was transferred to the Mental Health & Wellbeing Team. There was no clear care plan in place whilst he was under the care of the Mental Health & Wellbeing Team. A new Care Co-Ordinator was allocated on the 5 June 2024. This Care Co-Ordinator met with Mr. Fraser on only one occasion (19 June 2024). Mr Fraser did not converse with the care co-ordinator at this time, so a meaningful risk assessment could not be completed. The last recorded contact with Mr. Fraser by the NHS services was an administrative call on the 9 July 2024. Family last had contact with him on the 8 July 2024. Visits were made by the mental health and wellbeing team on 16 July 2024, 22 July 2024 and the 24 July 2024 but there was no response. The family were informed that Mr. Fraser was “denying entry”. The team did not make it clear to the family that they had received no response at all from Mr. Fraser – either to home visits or telephone calls. The mental health team did not notify the family that a friend had also raised concerns about a lack of contact with Mr Fraser on the 18 July 2024. When a further failed visit occurred on the 29 July 2024, the mental health and wellbeing team requested that the family assist them in gaining access to Mr. Fraser. Mr. Fraser's sister attended his home address and found him clearly deceased within the premises. A paramedic attended and pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. A post-mortem examination was carried out. Despite a post-mortem examination, which included specialist tests for toxicology and neuropathology, a cause of death could not be identified. The pathologist considered that Mr. Fraser had likely passed away a few weeks before he was found. There was a lack of clear risk assessment, risk management and care planning by the Mental Health and Wellbeing Team, but it is not possible to reach a conclusion about the causal effect of this, as both the date when Mr Fraser passed away and the cause of death are unascertained.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) There was no clear and documented care plan in place whilst Mr Fraser was under the care of the Mental Health and Wellness Team. There was a lack of structure to the care provided to Mr Fraser by the Mental Health and Wellness Team. (2) There was no robust risk assessment carried out by the Mental Health and Wellness team. (3) The Mental Health and Wellness Team had been unable to reach Mr Fraser from the 16 July 2024. On the 18 July 2024 a friend contacted the mental health team to raise concern about his lack of contact with Mr Fraser. No action was taken at this time to review the risk of harm to Mr Fraser or to determine whether the Trust's missing person procedure should be activated. There was no meaningful contact with the family to report the concerning lack 3 of contact with Mr Fraser, until the 29 July 2024. 6","George Kenneth Fraser, aged 37, with schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and alcohol misuse, was discharged from a mental health hospital in March 2024 and subsequently cared for by the Mental Health & Wellbeing Team from May 2024. There was no clear care plan or robust risk assessment during this period. A new Care Co-Ordinator met Mr Fraser only once, with no meaningful engagement. From mid-July 2024, the team failed to make contact despite multiple visits and a friend's concerns raised on 18 July. The family was not informed of the lack of response until 29 July, when Mr Fraser was found deceased at home. The cause and date of death remain unascertained despite post-mortem examinations. The coroner identified concerns including the absence of a documented care plan, inadequate risk assessment, failure to act on concerns or consider missing person procedures, and poor communication with the family, highlighting a risk of future deaths without remedial action."
8,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/etta-lili-stockwell-parry-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2025-0236,2025-05-21,Kate Robertson,North West Wales,Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) 1,"On 20 May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Etta-Lili Stockwell-Parry (DOB 3/7/23) who passed away on 7 July 2023 (having received a transfer from the Coronial jurisdiction where Etta passed away). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 May 2025. A narrative conclusion was recorded with the cause of death as:- 1a Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy Etta Lili Stockwell-Parry was born at 40+13 gestational weeks on 3 July 2023 at 00:51 at Ysbyty Gwynedd in poor condition following an instrumental assisted birth. Etta was transferred later that day to Arrowe Park Hospital, Liverpool for specialist neonatal support where she passed away on 7 July 2023 as a result of inutero compromise which led to the condition from which she died. There were several opportunities not taken by those caring for Etta's mother antenatally including at 40+1 gestational weeks and at 40+5 gestational weeks and at 40+12 gestational weeks to escalate from a midwife to a registrar due to static growth which would have led to induction of labour and likely safe delivery of Etta. There were opportunities to identify concerns with Etta through her mother on the midwifery led unit on 2 July 2023 including properly conducting holistic assessments, properly completing partogram and manual palpation of maternal pulse which would also likely have resulted in earlier detection of distress and successful delivery. Etta's death was contributed to by neglect.","The circumstances of the death are as follows :- Etta was born in poor condition at Ysbyty Gwynedd on 3 July 2023 where her Mother's pregnancy was uneventful up until 21 June 2023 (40+1 gestational weeks). Static growth had not been identified by the community midwife at this time and therefore there was no referral to obstetrics. The static growth was not identified for a second time at 40+5 gestational weeks on 25 June 2023. Again, there was no referral to obstetrics. When Etta's mother was 40+12, on 2 July, she arrived at the Maternity Outpatient Assessment Unit for induction of labour. It was not noted that there was static growth. She ought to have been referred to the labour ward for close monitoring. Instead, she was induced. She received intermittent monitoring. The holistic assessments were not always completed and not entirely complete, the partogram did not note baseline fetal heart rate only as required, the maternal pulse was not always taken and recorded and there was no recognition that Etta's mother's pulse was being recorded as opposed to the fetal heart rate. There were several gross failures identified in Etta's mother's care which resulted in opportunities not taken to deliver Etta before she became distressed. Etta was transferred to Arrowe Park Hospital for specialist neonatal care where she passed away 4 days later. There were many incidences of learning from a neonatal perspective relating to Etta's resuscitation at Ysbyty Gwynedd.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows – The maternity and neonatal departments undertook an investigation into Etta's mother's care antenatally and after Etta's delivery. The concerns are as follows:- a. The neonatal investigation was not thorough. The investigator did not obtain or request statements from doctors directly involved in Etta's resuscitation, nor did they meet with them to understand what had occurred. The investigation was based on records alone. The records themselves, identified as part of the investigation, were often incomplete or included retrospective entries. Despite this, the investigator nor the panel involved considered speaking to or obtaining statements from crucial individuals. Coroner's Office, Shirehall Street, Caernarfon b. There was no sufficiently full contextual sharing of the investigation or its findings from a neonatal or maternity perspective. Some witnesses had only received and read the report several weeks prior to the Inquest. c. The memoranda sent to staff highlighting the learning did not include context or narrative around the circumstances of investigation. Therefore, those not directly involved would not have been fully aware of the context of what had occurred. Having issued Reports to the Health Board regarding quality of investigation previously, this concern remains. Specifically, I have concerns that the neonatal element of the investigation was not thorough enough such that without this genuine learning and change will not and cannot occur. Even where learning has been shared, I am concerned that this is not contextualised sufficiently. I am also concerned that staff not involved in the incident will not learn fully enough from events where there is inadequate sharing of learning from an incident. 6","Etta-Lili Stockwell-Parry was born at 40+13 weeks gestation in poor condition following an instrumental birth and died four days later from hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy due to in utero compromise. Multiple missed opportunities to escalate care antenatally were identified, including failure to recognise static fetal growth at 40+1, 40+5, and 40+12 weeks, which would likely have led to induction and safer delivery. During labour, inadequate monitoring and assessments, including incomplete partograms and failure to distinguish maternal from fetal pulse, contributed to delayed recognition of fetal distress. The coroner found neglect contributed to Etta’s death. The maternity and neonatal investigations into the care were criticised for being insufficiently thorough, relying solely on incomplete records without obtaining statements from key staff involved in resuscitation. There was poor sharing and contextualisation of learning from the incident, limiting staff awareness and preventing meaningful improvements. The coroner expressed concern that without better investigation and dissemination of findings, similar deaths may occur in the future."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest 07/05/2025 . The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide. 1a Pressure On Neck, Consistent With Hanging 1b 1c II","These were recorded as follows Robert Maxwell Smith died on 26 th October 2023 at [REDACTED], Cardiff. Mr Smith died by hanging [REDACTED]. It is more likely than not that he intended the consequences of his action to result in his own death. Mr Smith had recent contact and intervention from mental health services and was known to be at risk of suicide due to a deterioration in his mental health presentation over the preceding weeks. Mental heath services did not inform Mr Smith's wife of the extent of his suicidal ideations. Mr Smith had indicated that he would inform his wife of his raised suicidal ideations but did not do so. On balance, it cannot be said that if such information had been provided, Mr Smith's suicide would have been prevented. Conclusion: Suicide","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. The guidance provided to clinicians and nursing staff within the mental health services as to when information and sharing and information gathering was to be undertaken with, and from, family members and how such decisions are to be recorded on the standard forms lacked clarity, particularly as regards the distinction between information sharing and information gathering. Such guidance being of relevance when a patient has given consent for information sharing and gathering to take place and when, and in what circumstances, such steps would be taken. 2. The information leaflet provided to patients lacked sufficient detail of the approach taken by mental health services on the issue of information sharing and information gathering so that patients could readily understand the difference between the two and understand when the need for information sharing and/or gathering could arise and what steps would be taken by mental health services. 6","Robert Maxwell Smith died by suicide on 26 October 2023 in Cardiff, having recently been under mental health care due to a deterioration in his condition and known suicide risk. Mental health services did not inform his wife of the extent of his suicidal ideations, although Mr Smith had indicated he would do so himself. It is unclear whether sharing this information would have prevented his death. The coroner identified concerns regarding unclear guidance for clinicians and nursing staff on when and how to share or gather information with family members, particularly distinguishing between these actions and how to record them. Additionally, the patient information leaflet lacked sufficient detail to help patients understand the mental health services' approach to information sharing and gathering. The coroner warned that without action on these issues, future deaths may occur."
