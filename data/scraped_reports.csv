Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.","On 11th March 2020, Alison Mutch OBE, Senior Coroner for Greater Manchester (South), opened an inquest into the death of Dr Malcolm Dixon who died on 29th December 2019 at the Priory Hospital, Altrincham. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I heard between 1st and 5th November 2021.

The consultant pathologist who undertook the post mortem examination determined Dr Dixon died as a consequence of:
[REDACTED]

At the end of the inquest, I recorded a narrative conclusion that Dr Dixon took his own life whilst his state of mind was adversely affected by a severe depressive illness.","During autumn of 2019, Dr Dixon became unwell with what was later diagnosed as a severe depressive illness.

Dr Dixon was admitted to the Priory Hospital, Altrincham as an informal, voluntary patient and was treated by means of medication, observation by and interaction with staff, and participation in activities sessions.

Dr Dixon died on 29th December 2019 at the hospital, as a consequence of [REDACTED].

This was an impulsive act undertaken within the context of an episode of severe mental illness.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. -
The Court heard it was likely that an observation chart, designed to record regular observations, had been pre-populated by a staff member to show when observations were intended to be taken as opposed to recording when they actually took place.
Additionally, the Court heard that the automatic timings generated by the electronic care record system in use at the Priory could be over-written manually, thus leading to inaccurate times being recorded in the records.
The following concerns arise from the above:

1. Given the particular importance of documented observations being taken at specific intervals on mental health wards, it is a matter of concern that standardised observation charts (together with accompanying standard rules as to how they should be completed) are not in use across these settings both in the NHS and private sectors;

2. For similar reasons, it is a matter of concern that automatic time-stamps generated by electronic care records systems can be overwritten by users without the corresponding record showing clearly that this has happened, whilst also recording of the actual time an entry has been made.

3. It is a matter of concern that, where record keeping on a ward is undertaken by unregistered staff such as Nursing Assistants and Healthcare Assistants, such individuals are not subject to professional"

Health and Safety executive [REDACTED],"On the 7th June, the senior coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Shaun Carter. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19th July 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion. The medical cause of death was:

1a) Blunt Head Trauma.","Shaun Carter was employed by Tonic Construction and on 31st May 2016 he was engaged in removing spoil to a spoil heap at a construction site in Cirencester. Evidence demonstrated that Shaun drove his dumper truck up the spoil heap, however at the top the truck went over the edge. Shaun jumped from the dumper truck but was struck by it during the fall. He suffered catastrophic injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

1. At the inquest there was evidence that the risks associated with the use of dumper trucks was recognised and that risk assessments and method statements were written which reflected these risks. However the safety procedures were not followed, not seen by all relevant personnel (some of whom could not read) and the practice in this regard was not audited.

2. At the inquest it was confirmed that there was no process in place to ensure that spoil heaps were managed safely, nor any guidelines issued by the HSE in this regard. This has been addressed by Tonic Construction in relation to the sites it manages, but there are still no industry standards relating to the management of spoil heaps.

3. Dumper trucks are designed to ensure that drivers are protected, even if the dumper trucks topple over. However the inherent open nature of trucks can nonetheless make the driver feeling vulnerable and despite the instructions which require the driver to remain seated during an incident, statistics indicate (as in this case) that the natural reaction of drivers is to jump from the truck."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8th August 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased died as a result of an adverse reaction to the drug nitrofurantoin and that her death was due to misadventure.,"The deceased had a history of severe urinary tract infections with severe symptoms of both a physical and mental nature. In 2007 her General Practitioner [REDACTED] having taken advice from a consultant prescribed the drug nitrofurantoin on a prophylactic basis. The deceased subsequently suffered from serious lung disease as an adverse reaction to the drug and when in 2008 this was recognised as a probability, the prescription of the drug was discontinued and an alert was subsequently posted in the patient's medical records. In 2011 the deceased again suffered a urinary tract infection. [REDACTED] failed to heed the alert within the medical records and on 10th August 2011 issued a prescription for nitrofurantoin. [REDACTED] issued a further prescription for the drug on 12th April 2012 and on 26th July 2012 a nurse practitioner within the medical practice also issued a prescription for the drug. On 1st August 2012, without examining the patient, a final prescription of nitrofurantoin was issued. On 8th August 2012 the deceased died at her home at [REDACTED] Palacefields, Runcorn as a result of an adverse reaction to nitrofurantoin.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. [REDACTED] ignored a warning alert in the medical records that his patient had suffered an adverse reaction to nitrofurantoin without checking the nature of the adverse reaction and issued a prescription for the drug regardless.

[REDACTED] on commenting on alert warnings, said that most are ""trivial, spurious, irrelevant or just wrong"", identified a phenomenon that he described as alert fatigue and further stated that colleagues within the practice had admitted that they ""may well have done the same in my situation"".

I am concerned that if [REDACTED] comments correctly describe the attitude within his medical practice to patient safety alerts this is a matter of considerable concern and warrants investigation by you to ensure first of all that the practice has a robust system in place for posting such alerts, secondly that such alerts when posted, correctly and sufficiently identify the problem and thirdly that doctors and medical staff within the practice have full understanding and training to respond to such alerts in an appropriate manner."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5th March 2025.

The medical cause of death was:
1a Hanging

The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows:

Jean Pike was a vulnerable women aged 54 at the time of death and had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and suffered from a depressive illness. Jean resided in supported accommodation and was under secondary mental health care. In the three months prior to her death Jean's mental health deteriorated and she engaged in serious self-harm to manage her suicidal thoughts. At this time all those involved with Jean knew she was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was expressing an intention to hang herself and was impulsive. Jean had two hospital admissions in the three weeks before her death and during this time support staff at Jean's accommodation and Jean's care co-ordinator were clearly communicating to the acute hospital where Jean was admitted on both occasions that they could not keep Jean safe in the community in her supported accommodation and that they were concerned that Jean was going to hang herself. Seven days before Jean's death a decision was taken by a consultant psychiatrist to discharge Jean from hospital nine hours after she had been admitted and at time when Jean was still actively experiencing suicidal thoughts. This decision was taken without any consultation with the professionals involved with Jean and there was no risk assessment of Jean's risk of suicide undertaken by the consultant before Jean was discharged. I find that these actions including the decision to discharge Jean from hospital constitute a gross failure to provide Jean with basic medical attention which she obviously needed and that this contributed to Jean's death. On the day of her death Jean experienced a",On 18 May 2022 Jean Pike was stating that she was suicidal and intending to hang herself. Jean Pike was left unattended and unobserved for between 20 	6 45 minutes. Jean Pike was then found suspended in her supported living accommodation on 18 May 2022 and declared deceased at 14.27.,"During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.

I am concerned that Jean was discharged from Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital on two occasions shortly before her death by a consultant psychiatrist and that prior to the decision to discharge on both occasions there was no multi-disciplinary meeting between the consultant on Ward F and the professionals directly involved in caring for Jean in the community about Jean's mental health and the risks she posed to herself in the community. This was in circumstances where the consultant knew before the decisions to discharge that these professionals, which included Jean's care co-ordinator, were clearly stating that they were extremely concerned about Jean's mental health and that they did not consider that they could keep Jean safe in the community and that they thought that Jean would hang herself in the community 	6 which is in fact what happened in this case. I am particularly concerned by the evidence I heard from Jean's care co-ordinator that care co-ordinators are rarely if ever consulted by consultant psychiatrists in Ward F of Neath Port Talbot Hospital before a decision is made to discharge a patient/person under secondary mental health care. This issue was not identified by Swansea University Bay Health Board ('SUBHB') in their internal investigation into Jean's death. This investigation found that ""there is evidence of regular and effective communication between support staff, community staff and hospital staff"".

The above finding of SUBHB's internal investigation raises a concern that critical lessons have not being identified and learnt by SUBHB from Jean's death about the importance of multi-disciplinary decision making in clinical care and risk management and the importance of including care co-ordinators and professionals in the community before a decision is taken to discharge a patient from Ward F. This creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F. I am also concerned that if there is a lack of clarity or a reluctance in Ward F at the consultant level to engage with care co-ordinators and professionals in the community (and before decisions are made to discharge) there is a risk that the concerns of the professionals managing a patient/person under secondary care will not be adequately considered in the decisions made by Ward F clinicians. This also creates a continuing risk to life as it may lead to risk being ignored or not properly considered by Ward F."

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) 7. The British Standards Institution","The inquest into the death of Mr Ashley Bullard, aged 32, was opened on 6th December 2018. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20th December 2022.

The medical cause of death was:
1a Head injury

The jury’s Narrative conclusion to the inquest was:
The car was placed by Ashley on outer pick up points, which was one of the set of points recommended by both Volvo and 'Autodata', the industry standard software.
The lift was examined after the incident. A feature of the lift, namely freeplay within the arms, contributed to the car not being held by the lift.
The combination of the alignment of the pads on the pick up points, the work being carried out on the car and the freeplay within the lift arms contributed to the car falling and as a result caused the death of Ashley Michel Bullard.","Ashley died due to a vehicle leaving a Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lift whilst he was working underneath it, at his place of work Wheel Art Ltd, now called Precision Bodyshop Ltd. The vehicle lift had been installed by Liftmaster Ltd, and was last serviced some 9 months before the incident, by Liftmaster Servicing.
The lift had not been serviced in accordance with the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998, nor maintained in accordance with guidance in the lift’s installation and operating manual, and contained grade 4.8 bolts not intended to have been in use at that time.
On 28.11.2018, Ashley used the vehicle lift to raise a Volvo S80 car using the outermost lift points, on or near the metal sill that formed the front user jacking points.
As Ashley worked on the car, the alignment of the pads and the freeplay within the arms of the vehicle lift contributed to the frame contact pads moving from beneath a structural part of the car to a non-structural part that could not support the vehicle. This led to the car falling, causing Ashley fatal injuries.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

Concerns directed to Bendpak Inc

CONCERNS

Freeplay:
1. Evidence was given that it could be possible to reduce the degree of freeplay in Bendpak 2-post vehicle lifts. Given lift points positioned close to the edge of the vehicle may be in danger of allowing lifting pads / frame contact pads on the Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lift and possibly other similar 2-post lifts, to move from a position under the structure of the vehicle, to a non-structural part of the vehicle, with a risk of the car leaving the vehicle lift, it appears the level of tolerated freeplay creates a risk of injury or death to those operating the lift.

Lift pad adapter:
2. It is unclear whether a narrow vehicle lift point is suitable for 2-post vehicle lifts using frame contact pads, or whether a better fitted lifting pad adaptor is available. Evidence was provided by an HSE expert engineer, that some form of slotted vehicle lift pad would be better suited when using a 2-post vehicle lift to raise a car by way of the narrow outer lift points that are more often used with vehicle jacks.

Warnings:
3. There are no warnings on the Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lift or in its installation and operation manual, that suggests caution or a prohibition on using a 2-post vehicle lift in conjunction with the outer most lift points on the underside of vehicles, that may be positioned on or near the sill or seam of the vehicle and often within a few inches from a non-structural part of the vehicle for lifting purposes.

Manuals:
4. At the point of providing suppliers / installers with the lift, Bendpak did not require any form of written confirmation of acknowledgment that suppliers received all manuals that Bendpak intended to provide, and considered important to the operation of the lift. It was unclear whether all such manuals were in fact provided.

Evidence was provided by the Bendpak CEO [REDACTED], that if he had known the XPR9 lift had grade 4.8 bolts in the gear ring, he would have considered it required being taken out of service unless and until those bolts were replaced by grade 8.8 bolts.
Bendpak issued, and Liftmaster supplied to its engineers, a Technical Service Bulletin Bendpak TSB 42-10201, that related to replacing the gear ring and bolts in lifts manufactured between 01.01.2010 and 01.01.2014, that may have replaced all grade 4.8 bolts with grade 8.8 bolts, and yet the XPR9 lift in question was manufactured on 14.07.2014 and still had slotted holes and a mixture of grade 4.8 bolts and grade 8.8 bolts on 28.11.2018.

Gear ring bolts:
5. There was no evidence as to whether all Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lifts with grade 4.8 bolts had been recalled or whether grade 4.8 bolts had been replaced in all existing XPR9 lifts, nor any evidence as to what efforts had made to contact customers that might still have such lifts in operation, in order to replace grade 4.8 bolts in lifts manufactured after 01.01.2014.

6. The specification of the grade and size and torque settings of gear ring bolts provided by Bendpak prior to installation was not sufficiently clear within Bendpak’s installation and operation manual, and appeared to cause confusion amongst engineers tasked with installing the lift and those required to service or maintain the lift.

7. It is not clear within Bendpak’s installation and operation manual as to which components and bolts in particular, are the subsequent lift owner’s responsibility to maintain.

Concerns directed to Liftmaster Ltd and Liftmaster Servicing

CONCERNS

Advice to lift owners:
1. There was little evidence of consistent practice amongst Liftmaster workers regarding informing the owners of vehicle lifts of the need to read the installation and operation manual, or in highlighting the important parts of the manual such as the need to tighten gear ring bolts. Liftmaster workers were not always aware that tightening a ‘safety-critical’ component such as gear ring bolts, were the customer’s responsibility, and hence that was not communicated to customers.

Engineers reading the installation and operation manual:
2. An experienced Liftmaster employee gave clear evidence that he did not read all of the installation and operating manual for the XPR9 lift, in spite of being said to have received refresher training from his employer less than 5 months before giving evidence. He said he was not required to read the manual when he was trained, even though he had also signed a letter confirming that he had in fact read the manuals for the XPR series. At the time of giving evidence, he was unaware of the torque table and the full extent of the lift maintenance requirements within the installation and operation manual, notwithstanding the fact that tightening of gear ring bolts was considered by all relevant witnesses, to be critical to the safety of the vehicle lift. That employee was said to be presently employed by Liftmaster and Liftmaster was said to presently install and service Bendpak lifts.

Physical clearance surrounding lifts:
3. Photographs suggested the clearances recommended by the manufacturer, between the lift posts and the nearest obstruction, were not maintained at the time of the incident. Those clearances were said to be 13 feet at the front of the lift, 11 feet at the rear of the lift, and 5 inches from the sides to the nearest wall.
Photographs taken very shortly after the incident, disclose the presence of a different vehicle within just a few feet of the rear of the lift used by Ashley in a neighbouring XPR9 vehicle lift / lift bay. It is unclear to what degree the recommended clearance requirements within the manufacturer’s installation and operating manual were considered or adhered to at installation.

Concerns directed to Precision Bodyshop Ltd, formerly Wheel Art Ltd

CONCERNS

Adherence to operating manual:
1. There was no evidence that Wheel Art Ltd ever required vehicle technicians operating the Bendpak XPR9 lift, to read the installation and operating manual or to maintain the lift in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. I am informed that Precision no longer owns any Bendpak XPR9 lifts, but instead uses Hoffman scissor lifts. This concern is not focussed on the make or model of lift but the use of lift operating manuals.

Maintenance records:
2. There was no evidence that Wheel Art Ltd ever kept records of inspections, maintenance, or repair of the Bendpak XPR9 lifts in accordance with the Bendpak XPR9 installation and operating manual. Again, whilst Wheel Art Ltd may now use different vehicle lifts, this concern is not focussed on the make or model of lift but on the maintenance of relevant records.

Concern directed to vehicle manufacturers and associations

(a) Volvo Car Corporation

(b) International Organization of Motor Vehicle manufacturers (OICA)

(c) The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA)

CONCERN

Outer lift points used with Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lifts:
1. Volvo (and/or other manufacturers) appear to designate lift points towards the edge of vehicles, that are near, on, or outside the sill or seam of the underside of the vehicle. Lift points in a position so close to the edge of a vehicle frame, appear to be in danger of allowing frame contact pads on a Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lift, and possibly other similar 2-post vehicle lifts, to move from a position under the structure of the vehicle, to a non-structural part of the vehicle, due to tolerated freeplay within the vehicle lift, leading to a risk of the car leaving the vehicle lift.
Whilst multiple lift points are identified in manuals and/or on Autodata, no warning is given with regards to any danger of using 2-post vehicle lifts on the outer most lift points.

Concern directed to The British Standards Institution

CONCERN

British Standards on the degree of tolerated freeplay in 2-post vehicle lifts:
1. There appear to be no British Standards for the safe, acceptable and/or tolerated degree of travel or length of travel in terms of freeplay in 2-post vehicle lifts in the UK. Whilst evidence was provided by the HSE that the industry body SAFed suggested an acceptable degree of freeplay is the diameter of the vehicle lift’s frame contact pad, it is noted that various 2-post vehicle lifts have different diameter pads, and hence there is no consistency in the amount of freeplay tolerated in 2-post vehicle lifts. It was also noted that the diameter of pad in the present case, at 130mm, could allow a frame contact pad, to move from a position underneath the structure of a vehicle, to a position under a non-structural part of the vehicle, which can cause the vehicle to leave the lift. An HSE engineer’s expert evidence was that it might be more sensible for tolerated freeplay to not exceed half the diameter of the frame contact pad."

The Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I conducted on 19th June 2024. The conclusion was that Ms Stapleton died from suicide. The medical cause of death was 1 (a) Incisional Injury to Right Femoral Artery and Vein.,"These were recorded as: -
Isobel Stapleton, aged 32, suffered depression. She was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan hospital as a voluntary inpatient on 18th June 2022 for assessment and was reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist. She was discharged on 24th June 2022, returned to reside with her father and received treatment from the home treatment team. On Saturday 9th July 2022 Ms Stapleton was at home and appeared to give no cause for concern until her father heard her call from upstairs. He found her on the floor of her bedroom with significant bleeding [REDACTED] He summoned help and comforted her as she lost consciousness. Paramedics were deployed at 14.49 and attended at 14.54 but her life could not be saved. It is likely that her injuries were self inflicted. Ms Stapleton expressed a clear intention to end her life in a hand written note found at the scene.
The Inquest focused upon the following: -
1. The assessment and management of the risk posed by Ms Stapleton to herself.
2. The information available to medical professionals and information sharing between professionals and agencies.
3. The availability of psychological assessment and treatment resources to the inpatient team at the Royal Glamorgan hospital and the home treatment team covering Merthyr Tydfil.
4. The involvement of Ms Stapleton's family in discharge planning.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
For your information the MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: -
(1) Mental health practitioners are not easily able to access all of a patient's relevant clinical records pending the introduction of a ""Once for Wales"" solution, for which there is currently no timetable for implementation.
(2) Mental health practitioners may not be aware of the existence of all such records, some of which may be in paper.
(3) Mental health practitioners in Wales currently have no way easily to access NHS England clinical records.
(4) The inpatient hospital team at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital did and does not have access to a clinical psychologist to provide direct assessment and treatment of a patient.
(5) The Home treatment team covering Merthyr Tydfil does not have access to a clinical psychologist to provide direct assessment and treatment of a patient. The waiting list for any necessary psychotherapy is months in length."

SG8 6EN","On 17 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Geoffrey Douglas HOAD aged 85. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 07 September 2023.

The medical cause of death was:
1a) Sub Acute Myocardial Infarction
1b) Coronary Artery Atherosclerosis
1c)
2) Hospital Admission for Post Operative Ileus

The conclusion of the inquest was:
Mr Hoad underwent an appropriate, elective medical procedure on 3 August 2022, following which a paralytic ileus was diagnosed. Mr Hoad's condition fluctuated and did not respond to conservative management. The decision was made to transfer Mr Hoad to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital at approximately 18.00 on 6 August 2022 and an ambulance called. The ambulance arrived at 08.26 hours on 7 August 2022. Mr Hoad's condition continued to fluctuate. At 18.50 Mr Hoad rapidly deteriorated and he died at 23.45 hours.","On 3 August 2022, Mr Hoad underwent a total hip replacement at The Spire Hospital. On 5 August 2022, Mr Hoad was diagnosed with a paralytic ileus and some respiratory compromise with gradually deteriorating renal function. On 6 August 2022, Mr Hoad's transfer to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital was agreed due to possible bowel obstruction, possible pulmonary infection and deteriorating renal function.

Ambulance service was called at 18:16 hours and again at 23.45. On 7 August 2022, the ambulance service was called again at 07.38 hours. The ambulance was on scene at 08:26 hours.

Mr Hoad was transported to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. At 11.30 am ECG was undertaken which showed signs of cardiac ischaemia. The evidence does not reveal whether this ECG was reviewed. The cardiac ischaemia was not noted and acted upon at this time. By 18.52 Mr Hoad had clinically deteriorated with continued low blood pressure and increased oxygen requirements. A repeat ECT showed ongoing ischaemia which was recognised and Mr Hoad was taken to Critical Care Complex at 20.18 hours with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Despite treatment, Mr Hoad continued to deteriorate and he died later that day on 7 August 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. The ambulance service was called on 6 August 2022 at 18.16 hours. The call was coded as a Category 3 call, requiring a response within 2 hours. The Spire Hospital were told the response would be 6 hours.
2. The ambulance service was called again at 23.45 hours and the call was again coded as a Category 3 call.
3. The ambulance service was called again on 7 August 2022 at 07.38 hours and the call was now coded as a Category 2 call, requiring a response within 40 minutes and with an average time of 18 minutes.
4. Due to continuing demand on the ambulance service, an ambulance did not become available until 08.16 hours. The ambulance arrived on scene at 08.26 hours.
5. The time between calling the ambulance service and an ambulance arriving was in excess of 14 hours.
6. Evidence was heard as to the very high call demand overnight on 6th and 7th August 2022 and with regard to the number of ambulances waiting at Hospitals in the region to hand over patients and as to the significant pressure the healthcare system was under.
7. Evidence was also heard as to the steps being taken by EEAST in an attempt to deal with this pressure on the healthcare system, including by way of training, recruitment, working with other ambulance services to develop a shared plan for these circumstances and also by way of collaboration with local acute and mental health hospitals in the area to look at ways to attempt to alleviate the difficulties experienced.
8. Despite the steps being taken by the EEAST, considerable delays in attending to calls continue."

National Medical Director, NHS England & NHS Improvement","On 23 September 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Richard STOCKIL aged 74. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 April 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

William Richard Stockil died on 6 September 2022 at Royal Surrey County Hospital, Egerton Road, Guildford, Surrey from a pneumonia. This developed following his admission for treatment of conditions caused by a long lie at his home where he had been on the floor for more than 8 hours on 31 August 2022.","On 31 August 2022 Mr Stockil was admitted to hospital having been found on the floor at home that day by his family. He was reportedly walking when his legs gave way and he was unable to get himself up. He had evidence of rhabdomyolysis and dehydration on admission.

I heard evidence that there was a suspicion Mr Stockil may have an infection due to infection markers, but I also heard that this could have been a result of inflammation following being on the floor. In any event he was prescribed broad spectrum antibiotics to cover an infection having been seen by a Dr at 1am on 1 September 2022.

Mr Stockil's prescription was completed using the Trust's electronic prescription system. It was intended by the Dr that he would receive IV 1.2grams of Co-amoxiclay once every 8 hours. When inputting the prescription, the Dr inadvertently selected 18 rather than 8 hourly administration using the drop-down menu. The Dr prescribed the medication for 72 hours on the basis that Mr Stockil was awaiting blood results and that once those were received, likely within 72 hours, there would be a review of his medications.

On 3 September 2022 Mr Stockil received the last dose of the prescription made on 1 September 2022. It had not been extended. The electronic prescription system sent out alerts to any member of staff who accessed his medical records on the system to make them aware that his prescription was due to end. It is not clear who received these but I heard evidence that they may have been received by a number of staff who would not consider that this was relevant to their role in the care of Mr Stockil and as such ""clicked"" off the alerts to them on the system. It was not the case that the alerts were only sent to prescribers but instead anyone who accessed his medical records for whatever reason.

The alerts were not picked up or actioned by any clinician. The system sent out the pre-agreed number of alerts and then stopped sending the alerts.

Mr Stockil received no further antibiotics until 5 September 2022 when he developed signs of infection and clinicians prescribed further antibiotics. The Court found that the cessation of medication was not on the balance of probabilities causative or contributory to Mr Stockil's death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

I heard evidence that the electronic prescription system at the Royal Surrey Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is provided by Cerner.

The system has been changed since the death of Mr Stockil in that alerts of medication ending are now only sent to clinicians who have the right to prescribe in order that alerts are seen by the correct staff. It is no longer the case that the alerts can be used up in sending alerts to clinicians who do not have the ability to address prescriptions.
The current version of the system generates alerts when anyone with a prescribing right accesses the patient's records.

This means that an alert will only be shown to a prescriber and only if they access the patient's records. Therefore, it was accepted that there was a risk that the alerting system would not operate to draw attention to the need for prescription review before the medication ceases if no prescribing clinician accesses a patient's record.

This creates a risk that medications will cease when they should be continued and creates a risk of future deaths."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 06 September 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Narrative Conclusion - Brian Beer, an 86 year old gentleman, died due to a recognised complication of necessary surgery on a fractured hip sustained in an unwitnessed fall. The development of this complication was contributed to by the fact that local guidelines were followed as to the cessation of prophylactic anti-coagulants after surgery, whereas evolving international policy indicates that prophylaxis should be continued for a longer time period. The death was also contributed to by frailty and advanced dementia, which both contributed to the fall and compromised Mr Beer’s physiological reserve, such that his capacity to recover from fracture, surgery and serious illness was compromised.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1a Small Bowel Ischaemia
1b Superior Mesenteric Artery Thrombus
1c

2 Advanced Dementia, Left Hip Hemiarthroplasty 08.01.24 with VTE Prophylaxis for 28 Days","Brian Beer died peacefully at the West Suffolk Hospital on 1 March 2024. He died of small bowel ischaemia, suffered due to a blood clot in an artery that provides blood to the small bowel. Sustaining such a blood clot is a recognised complication of surgery on a hip fracture. Mr Beer underwent a left femur head replacement on 8 January 2024, owing to a hip fracture. This fracture was sustained in an unwitnessed fall at his care home, which was contributed to by advanced dementia and frailty.
Although Mr Beer received prophylactic anti-coagulation after the hip surgery, in accordance with and for the duration required by local hospital guidelines, the international policy in this regard is evolving such that patients may be given anti-coagulation after surgery for a longer period of time. The cessation of anti-coagulation in Mr Beer’s case at the time it was ceased contributed to his death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

If NICE guidelines as to prophylactic anti-coagulation after surgery on a hip fracture do not reflect the most up-to-date international learning, then there is a risk of future deaths being contributed to by hospitals following NICE guidelines when a longer period of anticoagulation post-surgery would better protect them against recognised complications of the surgery.

Explanation:

On referral of the case to the Coroner's Court: [REDACTED], Medical Examiner, wrote:

""Given that he had no history of atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease or diabetes and atherosclerosis was not noted on the CT scan, there appears to be a temporal relationship between the discontinuation of the Tinzaparin and the superior mesenteric arterial thrombus causing the ischaemic bowel. Local policy was followed. Internationally the policy is evolving ... patients have longer on an anticoagulant after fractured neck of femur. Referral in light of a potential indirect link between the discontinuation of the anticoagulation and the death.""

In further communication with the Court in the course of the investigation, [REDACTED] wrote:

""His death is directly related to the thrombus within the superior mesenteric artery and his only other co-morbidity is advanced dementia and frailty. It is likely that if recommendations for fracture neck of femur is brought into line with the recommendations for elective hip replacement surgery, he would not have had this thrombus. Therefore, to the best of my knowledge, the cessation of the anti-coagulation did make a material difference to his death.""

The findings and conclusion of the Inquest were based on this evidence.

After the conclusion of the Inquest, I received further communication from [REDACTED]. In that further clarification, she stated that ""venous thromboprophylaxis ('VTE') prophylaxis ... was for the prevention of venous thrombosis and this gentleman died of an arterial thrombus, therefore it is not clear what role the VTE prophylaxis plays in this, however there is potentially a state of hypercoagulability following discontinuation of VTE prophylaxis."" [REDACTED] went on to add that ""our local guidelines are in line with NICE guidelines""; but she queried ""whether the NICE guidelines (now 5 years old) need to acknowledge this potential risk of hypercoagulability in the immobile, elderly patients on discontinuation of the VTE prophylaxis and/or consideration of alternative agents or regimes in this particular demographic, should it become evident that there is indeed this risk.""

After the conclusion of the Inquest, I was also provided with an opinion from [REDACTED], an expert haematologist. [REDACTED] advised that the guidance relating to venous thrombosis is not relevant to an arterial clot - and prophylaxis is not given against arterial clots. In her view, and that of two other expert practitioners in this area, the cessation of VTE prophylaxis and the development of the arterial clot were not related. [REDACTED] added that neither she, nor her two colleagues, are aware of an evolving international consensus over the length of time for prophylaxis after a fractured neck of femur.

A communication was also then received from [REDACTED] who added: ""The Hip fracture team are aware of some emerging early evidence regarding extending VTE prophylaxis in such patients beyond the 4 week point.""

Bearing in mind [REDACTED] evidence regarding evolving international policy, and [REDACTED]'s indication of ""some emerging early evidence"" in this regard, in my opinion it is appropriate to ensure that this concern is brought to the attention of NICE, to ensure that appropriate consideration be given as to whether the national guidelines in this area require revision, particularly bearing in mind that surgery on hip fractures is far from uncommon in immobile and elderly, and therefore vulnerable, patients."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 April 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

The deceased (who was a vulnerable adult upon a care package ) died on 27th November 2021 at Lincoln County Hospital, Greetwell Road, Lincoln where he was admitted having been found in a collapsed state by his carers earlier that day. Sadly despite treatment his condition deteriorated and he passed away the same day. A safeguarding referral was subsequently made.",Please refer to above and below,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

1. Adult Social Care were first involved in 2017 due to the deceased self neglecting. It is recorded assessments were not able to be completed.

2. It was not until April 2021, 3 years later and despite care packages being in place and funded by Lincolnshire county Council, that the deceased became known again to Adult Social Care where it was deemed necessary to provide ongoing support of the Wellbeing team and Adult Social Care until his passing in November 2021.This was as a result of a referral from the GP.
What happened in those 3 years by way of observations upon the deceased by safeguarding and if none shouldn't there have been something in place? Nothing has been evidenced to date. Shouldn't measures have been in place to review/monitor?

3.EMAS make there own safeguarding referral on 29th November 2021 as he appeared to them on the one time they saw the deceased that he was underweight and showing signs of clinical dehydration. If they were able to observe this why is none else in Adult Social Care making the same assessment during his lifetime?

4.After his death LCC decide to undertake a s.42 assessment under the categories of neglect and acts of omission.

5.The outcome from the admitted ""limited information gathered"" was that no risk was identified and no action taken. Despite the toxicology report still to be received the enquiry was closed and never reopened. As a result no appropriate action was taken to mitigate any risks to others.

6.Conflicting evidence was provided by bluebird care that :
 Registered Manager (02/02/2023) - ""the only drink we pour for him is water, we never poured alcohol for him""
""26th November 2021 14:24 from carer's log - ""water and whiskey provided on top of ongoing medication""
EMAS report (12/04/2022) - ""bottles of alcohol were found by his bed and enquired with the carers ,however they believed he doesn't drink a lot as he was unable to pour on his own"".
If that is right somebody was pouring for him. Shouldn't all this have been picked up by the safeguarding assessment?

7.Instead the s.42 reporter according to the live evidence of the principal practitioner of the Adult Safeguarding team of the day, appears to have collated only limited information and closed the inquiry down prematurely without looking at material documents or even awaiting the toxicology report. At the very least it should be reopened to see if there was any missed opportunities from which lessons could be learnt and future deaths prevented and to embody the whole purpose of a s.42 assessment in deciding what action to take to support and protect the person in question. It being reiterated that this assessment was only commissioned after the deceased had passed away."

2. [REDACTED] Director General Chief Executive – HM Prison and Probation Service (formerly known as The National Offender Management Service)","On 21 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Floyd Everton CARRUTHERS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was;

Conclusion of the Jury as to the death

These are the points that the Jury have discussed and reached a unanimous decision based on the following:-

1. The fact the Mr Carruthers died of an infected heart valve and this was from a natural condition.
2. The fact that Mr Carruthers had probably had the infection for weeks if not months.
3. Based upon the evidence heard in court, on the balance of probabilities the source of infection was not contributed to by the pressure sores found on Mr Carruthers body.
4. A blood test was ordered on 15/05/2021 but was not carried out. Based upon the evidence heard in court a blood test may have shown markers of inflammation and possibly infection which could have prompted earlier intervention.
5. The Prison staff involved in delivering the regime on Lima Wing in relation to Mr Carruthers from 10/05/2021 - 29/5/2021 had 10 weeks basic training at the start of their service but had insufficient ongoing mandatory training and understanding of the matters contained in the National Offender Management Service, Adult Safeguarding in Prison Policy, PIS 16/2015 dated 31/3/19, to enable them to undertake their role in compliance with that policy.
As per evidence heard in court there was no safeguarding training in place during the period of Mr Carruthers incarceration.
6. The Prison staff on Lima Wing and the HMP Birmingham Healthcare staff took insufficient steps to safeguard Mr Carruthers throughout the period 10/5/2021 - 29/5/2021. This includes insufficient record keeping, handover and escalation of events, such as missed meals and not leaving his cell.
7. There were failures of Prison staff to make a referral to healthcare in response to Mr Carruthers condition, as reflected in his overall pattern of behaviour and his presentation, between 25/5/2021-29/5/2021
As a result the Jury have reached a conclusion that death was contributed to by neglect.","1) Mr Carruthers was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2003.
2) Mr Carruthers was under the care of the Mental Health Team and on the whole had a good rapport, however could become irritable if challenged on his mental health by mental health professionals. Mr Carruthers was self aware of his condition and learnt to manage it, it is noted that he heard voices as part of his paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis even when stable. Whilst compliant to taking his medication, Mr Carruthers was stable. Mr Carruthers compliance with medication over time decreased and he subsequently stopped taking his medication.
3) Mr Carruthers was not on medication at the time of arrest and subsequent transfer to HMP Birmingham.
4) Mr Carruthers was arrested on the 09/04/21 and was taken to Perry Barr Police Station.
5) Whilst in custody at Perry Barr Police Station, Mr Carruthers underwent a Mental Health Act Assessment on the 10/04/21 which determined he was fit to be interviewed and did not meet the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act 1983.
6) Mr Carruthers arrived on remand at HMP Birmingham on 12/4/2021. He was sentenced to 66 days imprisonment on 6/5/2021.
7) Mr Carruthers underwent a reception medical screening at HMP Birmingham identifying his pacemaker. The resulting HMP Birmingham procedure is to raise a task, for a follow up on the pacemaker, this was not done.
The reception medical screening did not identify Mr Carruthers mental health history or the Mental Health Act Assessment completed on the 10/4/2021. The HMP Birmingham procedure is a mental Health Nurse Review within 48 hours, this was not done.
8) A mental health nurse attended Mr Carruthers cell on the 7/5/2021, this was triggered by concerns raised by Mr Carruthers family, to conduct an assessment. The assessment was completed from outside Mr Carruthers cell and was around one minute long. Mr Carruthers declined to input, he was polite but abrupt and the Nurse deemed Mr Carruthers had capacity to refuse mental health input.
9) Mr Carruthers was moved to Lima Wing on 10/05/2021 to a double cell. At the time of his transfer to hospital he was a single occupant of this double cell. It is noted that Mr Carruthers had multiple cell mates during his time on Lima Wing. From evidence heard in court, having multiple cell mates does not trigger a Health Care review.
10) A blood test was ordered on the 15/5/2021, it is unclear why it was ordered and why it was not undertaken.
11) There is a general agreement that during Mr Carruthers time on the Lima Wing he presented as reserved, shy and polite; he kept himself to himself.
12) The regime on Lima Wing changed regularly due to Covid restrictions and government regulations. It is generally accepted that the regime included a morning meal, delivered to Mr Carruthers cell, a hot meal to be collected from the servery and association and medicine collection.
13) A summary of interaction between Prison staff and Mr Carruthers between the 25/5/2021 - 29/5/2021 based on limited CCTV and Prison Officer statements, shown during the inquest is as follows. Between the days of 25/5/21 and 29/5/2021, Mr Carruthers had multiple interactions with Prison Officers summarised as including food deliveries, unlocking of his cell and officers entering and leaving Mr Carruthers cell.
The most notable event was when we last saw Mr Carruthers leave and return to his cell on the 25/5/21 having collected his hot meal. Following this we did not see Mr Carruthers leave his cell again.
With regards to meals - we saw Mr Carruthers collect food once on the 25/05/21, had food delivered as customary between the 25/5/21 and 28/05/2021. Mr Carruthers did not have a hot meal on the 26/05/21 or 27/05/21 and his hot meals bought to him on the 28/05/21 and 29/05/21. Multiple statements show evidence of Mr Carruthers not wanting meals or association time.
14) Evidence from Prison Officer statements show no concerns or observations raised or logged for Mr Carruthers during his time on Lima Wing up until 29/05/2021. Evidence shows that Prison Officers failed to notice a pattern due to no written log of observations or events.
15) A Prison Officer raised concerns regarding Mr Carruthers' health on the 19/05/2021 based on his presentation and appropriately escalated to his Custodial Manager. A Hotel 2, high est escalation, call was made to Prison Healthcare staff, to attend which occurred
16) The Prison Nurse attended and conducted initial observations which promoted a 999 call.
17) Paramedics attended and followed appropriate care, allocating roles to facilitate transfer to hospital and highlighting to Prison Officers that Mr Carruthers required a time critical transfer to City Hospital to gain essential input from the cardiac team.
18) Following treatment in his cell, Mr Carruthers was transferred to an ambulance for transfer to City hospital. Significant delays occurred in the Sterile Area of HMP Birmingham whilst paperwork, personnel and handcuff procedure were complete - it did not contribute to the death of Mr Carruthers
19) Upon presentation at City Hospital Mr Carruthers was extreamly unwell and was reviewed by the cardiac team. An ultrasound of the heart was used to quickly diagnose Mr Carruthers endocarditis and start treatment.
20) When Mr Carruthers was admitted to the Acute Medical Unit he was at the point of multiple organ failure with septic shock, acute renal failure, hepatic failure, and delirium probably related to sepsis and cerebral hypoperfusion.
21) Evidence suggests Mr Carruthers had staphylococcal endocarditus for weeks or potentially months prior to his hospital admission.
Evidence suggests Mr Carruthers is likely to have developed sepsis in the 1-3 days prior to his hospital admission, leading to septic shock and multi-organ failure on admission to hospital.
22) Mr Carruthers acute medical review led to a plan to take Mr Carruthers to New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton on 3/6/2021 with a view to open heart surgery. There he was reviewed by 2 Consultant Cardiac Surgeons who felt that with multiorgan failure he was very unlikely to survive open heart surgery at that point and he was therefore transferred back to City Hospital.
23) During this time, Mr Carruthers was in a critical condition, it was noted that Mr Carruthers was hand cuffed during the transfer from City Hospital to New Cross Hospital, at the recommendation of the Govenor) despite multiple conversations with the Prison Officers present. This showed a lack of consideration to Mr Carruthers medical condition and the true risk to Hospital staff and the public.
24) Following his return to City Hospital, he became more drowsy and less responsive over the following days. He passed away peacefully on the morning of 14/6/2021.

Following a post mortem, the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a Cardiac tamponade. Hypostatic pneumonia

1b Haemorrhagic pericarditis

1c Infective endocarditis (implanted electronic cardiac pacemaker for 2nd degree atrio-ventricular block).

II","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

1. At the time Mr Carruthers resided in HMP Birmingham, National Offender Management Service, Adult Safeguarding in Prison Policy, PSI 16/2015 dated 31/3/19 was in force. This policy states at paragraph 1.10 (under the heading 'Mandatory Actions') ""Governors must have systems in place to protect adult prisoners from abuse and neglect"". At paragraph 2.4 the policy states ""Neglect also includes self-neglect, which covers a wide range of behaviour such as neglecting to care for one's personal hygiene, health or surroundings and behaviour such as hoarding"". My concern is that while there is a national policy dealing with safeguarding, to include instances of self-neglect, no adequate training exists at either national or local level to ensure the effective implementation of that policy.

2. While evidence was heard from prison staff detailing a number of potential escalation routes for what might be termed 'social isolation' (an instance, as with Mr Carruthers, where they had not left their cell for a period of days but had not declared they were self isolating), notably ACCT and CISP, none of the officers appeared aware of a corresponding process for raising safeguarding issues. The known escalation routes (ACCT and CISP) are more focussed on violence and self-harm, leaving at the very least a conceptual gap in how best to deal with injurious activity which is neither violent nor directly/obviously contributory to self-harm, such as self-neglect. My concern is that the existing safeguarding escalation process is either inadequate, inappropriately trained or both"

The Chief Executive of the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust 2. The Chief Executive South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,"Inquest opened 12th July 2019 into the death of Denton Donovan Duhaney Inquest concluded 30th March 2021

I recorded the medical cause of Mr Duhaney's death was due to Hanging (Asphyxia) and a conclusion of suicide","On the 22nd June 2019, Mr Duhaney had been admitted to the Accident and Emergency Department of Dewsbury District Hospital with both physical and mental health concerns.

He was assessed by a nurse from the Psychiatric team, who recommended he should be admitted as an informal patient on to a psychiatric ward. However, no bed was available and he was therefore transferred to Pinderfield's Hospital early on the morning of the 23rd June 2019 and admitted on to the Acute Medical Assessment Unit.

Mr Duhaney underwent a further mental health assessment at 17.00hrs by a member of the Wakefield Home Based Treatment team following a request by the Kirklees Home Based Treatment team within whose area Mr Duhaney resided.

At this point a psychiatric hospital bed could still not be found within the area (Mr Duhaney had requested to remain in the area as his partner was gravely ill).

At the time of this assessment an alternative treatment plan was agreed with Mr Duhaney namely that when he was physically well enough to be discharged, he would be provided with care and support in the community setting by the Kirklees Home Based Treatment Team. At the time of this assessment Mr Duhaney was assessed as being at high risk of further mental health deterioration.

Following assessment the Wakefield Home based Treatment team referred Mr Duhaney back to the team in Kirklees.

It appears that at no time either at the time of transfer or during his admission was Mr Duhaney referred to the psychiatric services within Pinderfield's Hospital.

In the ensuing days the Kirklees Home Based Treatment team made telephone contact with both Mr Duhaney and Acute Medical Assessment unit, leaving contact telephone details and a request that they be contacted and notified when Mr Duhaney was to be discharged.

It appears Doctors on the ward believed Mr Duhaney was awaiting a hospital Psychiatric assessment.

On the afternoon of 25th June 2019 Mr Duhaney approached a member of the nursing team at the nurses station and stated he wished to self-discharge. Blood test results were still awaited. The nurse gave evidence at the inquest, she stated that she spoke to a female doctor the identity of whom she could not recall advising her of Mr Duhaney's wishes, the doctor did not undertake an assessment upon Mr Duhaney, the nurse proceeded to warn Mr Duhaney that his discharge was against Medical advice and got him to sign the appropriate form.

The nurse in evidence stated she was unfamiliar with the trusts protocol document ""Standard Operating Procedure for Managing the Discharge of Patients. Mr Duhaney left the hospital. No hospital staff member contacted Kirklees Home Based Treatment Team of Mr Duhaney's self discharge.

The lead Investigator of a Serious Incident Investigation Report undertaken by South West Yorkshire Partnership Trust in respect of the involvement of Home Based Treatment Teams stated in evidence that he was advised by the Modern Matron at Pinderfield's Hospital that it was normal Practice of the hospital not to arrange follow up in the community in these circumstances when it was planned for if, the patient self discharges.

Five days later on 30th June 2019 a staff member from Kirklees Home Based Treatment team contacted Pinderfield's Psychiatric Liaison Team seeking an update upon Mr Duhaney, only to be advised that Mr Duhaney had self discharged 5 days previously. Immediate steps were taken by Kirklees Home Based Treatment to try and make contact with Mr Duhaney to no gain. As a result the police were contacted who attended at his home, now the early hours of 1st July 2019, they forced entry and found Mr Duhaney with a length of medical plastic piping around his neck which had been secured to an adjoining door handle, his death was confirmed a short time later by an attendant paramedic.

Mr Duhaney appeared to have been dead for some time, he was still wearing hospital clothing beneath his own clothing.","The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows: 1. Mr Duhaney was a patient at Pinderfield's Hospital between 23rd and 25th June but at no time was he assessed or receive treatment by the in house psychiatric team despite the fact that he had an underlying psychiatric presentation.

2. Pinderfields hospitals discharge protocol does not appear to have been adhered to when Mr Duhaney expressed a wish to self-discharge.

3. No one from Pinderfield's Hospital contacted Kirklees Intensive Home Based Treatment Team to notify them of Mr Duhaney's self discharge.

4. Kirklees Home Based Treatment Team last had contact with Pinderfield's Hospital on 24th June 2019. It was 6 days later that they made a further call to the hospital seeking an update upon Mr Duhaney."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8th August 2014 .The conclusion of the Inquest was - A Narrative Conclusion - [REDACTED]",Please see Record of Inquest.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) Although this man arrived in A & E on the 28th March 2014 at approximately 12:30, having been suffering confusion, abdominal pain and vomiting for some three days with raised white cell count and markedly raised C-Reactive Protein. He was not commenced on antibiotics until over 48 hours later at 14:00 hours on the 30th March, 2014. At Inquest I was told that he should have been commenced on Pragmatic antibiotics shortly after his arrival and assessment by a Doctor in A & E.

(2) At 20:00 hours on the 28th March 2014 after he had been admitted to The Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton his NEWS rose from 1 to 6. NEWS' own Guidance and the Hospital's Protocol require that Mr. HILL should have been referred to the Critical Care Outreach Team. He was not. His NEWS rose to 6 again on the 30th March 2014 at 00:20 hours, However, he was not referred then either. He was not referred to Critical Care Outreach until his NEWS rose to 10 at 07:00 hours on the 30th March 2014.

(3) Whilst it is noted that Mr. HILL was admitted at lunchtime on a Friday and the critical events took place over a weekend, nonetheless he was known to be an intravenous heroin user on a Methadone prescription and yet he was given no treatment for withdrawal treatment save for 2mg of Diazepam on the 28th March at 22:15 hours and another 2mg of Diazepam at 09:00 on the 30th March. Also on the 30th March PABRINEX was considered and he was written up for this, although this was not given. On the 30th March at 09:50 hours he was given 5ml of METHADONE and later at 13:00 on the 30th March he was given another 5ml of Methadone. (NB: His daily Methadone prescription was 50ml)

(4) When Mr. HILL arrived in A & E it was found that he was suffering from constipation with impacted faeces in his bowel. He was written up for an enema and the Doctor who saw him directed that he should be given laxatives. The latter were never written up for him and the former was never given. In the event, careful study of the notes showed that he opened his bowels for the first time on the evening of the 28th March 2014 but this information was not apparently noted by the Doctors who were still talking about constipation over the next 24 - 36 hours. This shows poor patient handover and poor communication between the shifts and poor note taking.

(5) There are serious omissions on the Medical Administration Record. I was told that it was believed that no Senior Pharmacist reviewed the MAR charts over a weekend. Given the importance of medicating patients correctly, it would seem advisable that there should be a review, if indeed it is the practice that records are not reviewed. It seems that in this particular case the charts are particularly poorly written and perhaps those involved with this patient would benefit from a discussion with the Chief Pharmacist."

London SW1A 2NS",On 14/06/2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Galea. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20th November 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was that he killed himself.,"Peter Galea was a 51 year old male, who lived with his mother as her main carer. When his mother had been diagnosed as terminally ill, Mr Galea was unable to cope and his alcohol intake increased.
In the morning of 8th June Mr Galea accompanied by his brother attended Cherry Knowle Hospital, being the Mental Health Hospital for the City, and was redirected to the Accident and Emergency Department of Sunderland Royal Hospital, where arrangements were made for a mental health assessment to be undertaken at 10:30hrs. Mr Galea was assessed as low risk and he was given contact numbers of services he could contact for support.

Mr Galea also presented to the Emergency Department of Sunderland Royal Hospital on 10th June and was subject to a mental health assessment at 13:45hrs. There was no change from the first assessment. Other referrals were instigated, self help material given and it was noted that Mr Galea had an appointment to see his GP on 11th June at 8:40am.

On 11th June at 04:40hrs Mr Galea presented again to Sunderland Royal Hospital and was subject to a third mental health assessment and was assessed as low risk. The plan for him was to see his GP the following day to discuss a possibility of being prescribed appropriate medication.

Each of three mental health assessments was faxed to Mr Galea's GP.

During the course of the Inquest it became apparent that Mr Galea had been involved with a number of other agencies over this 72 hour period, including the Ambulance Service and Police. It was also the case that Mr Galea had engaged and disengaged from his GP on 10th June.

Mr Galea had also expressed the view that he wished to be admitted to Cherry Knowle Hospital and although compliant on occasions, he appeared to become frustrated when this did not become a possibility.

When Mr Galea attended his GP on 11th June shortly after 8am, he was persistent in his demand to be admitted to Cherry Knowle Hospital. I heard evidence that this was not for the GP's to do, and although Mr Galea was extremely agitated, the GP deployed all of his available skills to try and calm Mr Galea. The GP discussed other options with Mr Galea, including a referral back to the Mental Health Team, prescription of medication and a possibility of the GP contacting the Police to have him removed to a place of safety. No options would be considered by Mr Galea other than going to Cherry Knowle Hospital for admission. Mr Galea threatened to jump from a bridge and left the General Practitioner's surgery. The GP contacted the Police and they conducted a search. Mr Galea's body was found under the Queen Alexandra Bridge on 11th June and he was pronounced dead at 12:51hrs.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  -

Mr Galea was not known to mental health services and experienced multiple presentations to a number of professionals and agencies within a 72 hour period and had 3 mental health assessments, all of which placed him at a low risk.
Whilst it is a tragedy that the professionals and agencies did not have more of an opportunity to work with Mr Galea before he took his own life, I was concerned, that: -
1) there appeared to be limited mechanisms available to break the cycle of referrals between agencies without more positive action being taken whereby Mr Galea could be in a safe place whilst a more detailed assessment of his needs could be carried out possibly involving a psychiatrist. The family described the referral between agencies as ""ping pong"".
2) there were limitations upon the GP making a direct referral to have Mr Galea admitted to Cherry Knowle Hospital, because to do so Mr Galea would have had to go back to the Mental Health Team, with whom he had had three contacts within a 72 hour period. From the evidence it was clear that the GP had a positive relationship with his patient (for 4 years) and although prospectively acquiescing to the patient's wishes, in exceptional circumstances, it may be that a GP should be able to achieve an admission to a place of safety, even if only for a limited period of time. I readily acknowledge some of the disadvantages which may come into play by way of admission but in raising it there may also be advantages which would promote a patient's welfare.
3) I was grateful for the assistance of [REDACTED] Consultant Psychiatrist, but he was not able to offer to me any view about what may have been done differently for Mr Galea to avoid this very tragic outcome. In raising the matter with you, it may be that some solution to enhance patient's welfare and wellbeing can be found to prevent future deaths."

Chief Coroner,"An Investigation was opened into the death of Mr Benjamin Williamson on 11 April 2018 following his death on 4 April. This culminated in an inquest on 8 November 2018 where I found Mr Williamson had died from 1a) Asphyxia 1b) Hanging II) Alcohol intoxication

I recorded a Conclusion of Suicide.",Mr Williamson had a long history of alcohol-related issues for which he had been receiving treatment from Addaction and Freshfield. He had regular contact with his GP and had appeared to be doing well. His death was a shock to all concerned.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  -

CMHT Commissioners

At inquest, I heard from [REDACTED], a partner at Mullion and Constantine Group Practice and the Locality Lead for Commissioning. Mr Williamson was his patient. [REDACTED] told me that Mr Williamson had been referred twice to CMHT. On both occasions, he had been seen, assessed and discharged. [REDACTED] described this as having a significant impact upon his patient who was left feeling he was not ill enough to be worthy of support. [REDACTED] expressed his view that the system is not set up to serve the population. He said it was his experience that patients like Benjamin are bounced between the various mental health services seemingly with no one willing or able to accept responsibility for providing professional care. [REDACTED] said he anticipated CMHT had met the letter of its contractual commitments but he felt it had failed to meet the needs of his patient. [REDACTED] identified that the problem was particularly acute for patients who have a mental health issue plus an alcohol (or drug) problem. He felt that while referring Benjamin to Addaction had addressed his alcohol-related concerns, there had been a total lack of consideration of any underlying mental health issue.
This is not the first occasion on which observations of this nature have been made before me although in [REDACTED] I have rarely had a more articulate or well-placed witness.

Addaction

[REDACTED] told me that after referring Benjamin to Addaction he had no communications or feedback from the service. I heard from [REDACTED] in this regard. It was accepted that there should have been more liaison with the GP and that, in particular, a letter from the doctor in January 2018 was not answered and should have been.
Upon further exploration, it emerged that Benjamin had not given full consent for disclosure to his GP. I was told that his Recovery Plan had been reviewed on 25/5/17, 16/8/17, 27/10/17 and 12/2/18. I was advised that the issue of consent should have been considered at these reviews but that did not appear to have happened. Both Benjamin's mother and [REDACTED] were of the view that if this matter had been dealt with fully, consent for disclosure to the GP would have been provided. [REDACTED] felt that the lack of feedback compromised his ability to provide care to his patient."

The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 17th January 2020. How, when & where she came about her death were found as follows:-

On 28.3.19 Deborah Margaret Lamont has travelled to the Village Hotel, Whitchurch. There, at some time after 9.40pm she has tied a ligature around her neck and suspended herself from an anchor point above the entrance door. She was found deceased by South Wales Police Officers just after 11pm. The evidence was sufficient to determine that she intended the consequences of her actions to be her own death.

My conclusion was Suicide","SWP officers attended room 161 at the Village Hotel at approximately 23:05 on Thursday 28/03/19 in response to a report from Hotel staff, concerned for the guest Debbie Lamont (DL).
Staff had been unable to get a response from Debbie and when opening the door to her room they believed that she was slumped behind the door and were unable to open the door further than a few inches.
Upon officers arrival staff used a key card to open the door and it was noted that a white bed sheet was wrapped around the overhead fire door closer which was attached to something heavy behind the door and inside the room.
Officers have at this point tried to remove the sheet however it was taut. Officers managed to slide inside the room and found Debbie slumped on her knees facing the bathroom with the bed sheet tied in a noose around her neck and suspending her slightly against the door. She was limp, cold to touch & pale.
There were no obvious signs of a disturbance.
Officers have commenced CPR chest compressions and rescue breaths and applied the defibrillator pads to her for around 10 minutes until Paramedics arrived. The defibrillator repeatedly advised no shock was advisable and to continue CPR.

Eventually Paramedics arrived and continued with CPR for around 30 minutes eventually declaring ROLE at 23:43 hours.

DL had experienced a suicidal episode earlier in the day in the hotel where response officers have attended. They have noticed that she was upset, sat with tights tied around her neck and superficial scratch's to her wrists. Paramedics attended and she spoke with the police control room Mental Health supervisor at the time. It was determined that she would be able to stay at the hotel as follow up mental health contact would be arranged.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

(1) The Inquest focused upon the response of the emergency services - SWP, WAST & CTMUHB Mental Health Nurse, to the earlier suicidal episode. Evidence was received from amongst others [REDACTED] of SWP, [REDACTED] – paramedic from WAST & Mental Health Nurse, [REDACTED] regarding their involvement with DL.

[REDACTED] gave evidence as to his interpretation of s136 Mental Health Act 1983(MHA). In particular, whether he believed that the power to remove DL arose in the particular circumstances he was presented with on the evening of 28.3.19.

In summary, his interpretation of s136 was that, even if he had been satisfied that DL was suffering from a mental disorder & in immediate need of care, or control, the power to detain would not have been available to him, due to the exclusion in s136(1A). His interpretation of that sub-section was that as DL had paid for the hotel room in which she was staying, that was a room in which she was living.

Regard was had during the Inquest as to the Department of Health Guidance to the changes to the MHA 1983, published in October 2017. No specific guidance as to the classification of a hotel room for the purposes of whether that falls within the exception in s136 (1A) is provided.

Whilst it is accepted, both by myself, & in the Guidance, as above, that there will always be some degree of discretion for a police officer to exercise in relation to the interpretation of whether a person is living in a hotel room, the evidence here was that DL had booked into the room for one night & had no more than a bare licence to occupy it (which would contrast with, for example, an individual or family temporarily housed in a hotel room by a local authority, or a care home resident occupying indefinitely a room in a care home).

Hence, based upon the evidence I received, and my interpretation (in these particular circumstances) of whether a hotel room came within s136 (1A) MHA, I found it likely that [REDACTED] did have the power to remove DL to a place of safety

My concern is that faced with a similar situation (albeit in circumstances were the officer did consider a person was suffering from mental disorder and requiring of immediate care, or control), an officer may reach the same conclusion as [REDACTED] determine the power to remove did not exist, and this may lead to a risk of death to that individual.

I would emphasise that whilst I interpreted s136 MHA as likely to afford [REDACTED] the power to remove DL on the night in question, I found his assessment of DL to be a reasonable one, and that the grounds to remove her did not exist as she was not in immediate need of care, or control.

(2) I consider that it is necessary for the police to consider their interpretation of whether a hotel room falls within the exception provided for by s136 (1A) MHA, and to provide clear guidance, and instruction to officers faced with exercising their powers under s136 MHA in circumstances were an individual presents with suffering from mental disorder, is requiring of immediate care or control and at that time is located in a hotel room."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 25th of September 2013 conducted by Assistant Coroner Nicola Jones. The conclusion of the inquest was Natural Causes and the medical cause of death was 1(a) Bronchopneumonia, Vulvulus of Sigmoid Colon with Infarction and Intestinal Obstruction.","The Deceased had been admitted to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd on the 1st of December 2012 feeling very poorly and with extensive bruising sustained in a fall from a ""stand aid"" used to assist her with her toileting needs. An autopsy was undertaken and the above medical cause of death was established.","During the course of the investigation it became apparent that Mrs Jones had sustained severe bruising to her upper body following the fall referred in paragraph 4 and that she should never have been placed in this ""stand aid"" which required her to some extent weight bearing. Mrs Jones had not been weigh bearing for over three years.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows :-

1. An inadequate assessment of the mobility of Mrs Jones was made
2. The stand aid was unsafe for use with Mrs Jones
3. Not all staff were aware of the limitations of Mrs Jones with regard to her mobility
4. Not all staff were able to operate the stand safely.

Whilst the incident did not contribute to this death I feel it is necessary to bring this to your attention due to the fragile and vulnerable nature of other patients cared for at the home for whom an injury in these circumstances could result in death."

The Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21st October 2014. The Conclusion of the Inquest was a Narrative Conclusion: Sonielia Laura Caya HOLMES was admitted to Bedford Hospital on 17th April 2013 suffering from confusion and seizures; she had a history of tonsillitis for the previous two weeks. She was eventually diagnosed with Haemophagocytic Syndrome on 2nd May 2013 following a fall which, as a result of her blood disorder, caused a bleed in her brain. The brain injury resulted in a lost opportunity to treat her underlying condition and she deteriorated and died from Multi Organ Failure at 17:06 hours on 4th May 2013.","The Deceased was taken to Bedford Hospital South Wing on 17th April 2013 suffering acute confusion and seizures. She was very unwell and taken to the Critical Care Complex the following day. She had mixed clotting abnormalities and was ventilated and treated. She was returned to Ward on 22nd April 2013. She deteriorated again and got out of bed on 2nd May 2013 and fell over. A CT scan revealed extra cranial and intracranial injuries. She was taken back to the Critical Care Complex, ventilated again and had a repeated CT scan. A referral to Addenbrooke's Hospital and The National Centre for Neurology in London was made, but both stated that she was not suitable for further intervention. Her pupils had become fixed and she died whilst still receiving supportive treatment.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. That on numerous occasions it proved impossible for the doctors attending Miss Holmes to contact the Haematology Department at the Hospital. This was despite the staff using all known contact details, including mobile phones and bleep numbers.

2. That the Haematologists working within the Hospital failed to respond to messages left for them to offer advice and to review Miss Holmes.

3. It was apparent from the evidence that Haematology is a vital service within the Hospital and any failure to respond to requests for assistance from other clinicians will put lives at risk."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Dr K D Foord sustained a Type A Aortic dissection on 2.5.22. His symptoms caused him to request an ambulance to go to the A and E Department at Conquest Hospital, Hastings arriving at 9.30am that day. An accurate diagnosis was made at 12 midday and arrangements were made with Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton to transfer his care to their cardiac surgery unit. A Category 2 ambulance was called for which took 1hr 19 minutes to arrive, 1 hr later than the 18 minute response time required by a Category 2 case.
Dr Foord was taken to theatre and underwent a lengthy operation, but the right coronary artery had completely detached from the aorta by the time surgery began which disaffected significantly his chances of survival.
Dr Foord died at 7.30am on 3.5.22, the cause of death being:-
1a) Acute type A Aortic Dissection (Emergency Aortic Repair 2/5/22).","Dr Foord died as a result of an Acute type A Aortic Dissection in spite of undergoing emergency repair on 2nd May 2022. He had presented to A and E at The Conquest Hospital where the correct diagnosis was made in a timely manner. He required an ambulance to take him to Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton where the regional cardiac surgery is undertaken. His case was categorised as 2 for response time for the ambulance service when all of the clinical, paramedic and expert witnesses whose evidence I heard at the inquest advised that it should be correctly categorised as 1 given the critical requirement for emergency surgery.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern, namely that for aortic dissection requiring emergency surgery and inter facility transfer, the category of this type of case for transfer should be raised to category 1. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 January 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was death by natural causes from multi organ failure due to Iliac artery rupture (operated), due to sever peripheral vascular disease, with underlying osteoporosis and pulmonary hypertension","Mr Moran was admitted acutely to the Royal Free on 25 July having been seen at the vascular clinic at UCLH on 20 July 2017 due to ongoing leg pain with left foot gangrene on the tips of his toes and chronic peripheral vascular disease.

He was expedited urgently to theatre where an angiography and angioplasty of the left iliac system was performed under local anaesthetic. During the procedure he suffered an iliac artery rupture, which was successfully treated. He initially made good clinical progress. However, the left lower limb became non-viable and an above knee amputation performed. His right lower limb then deteriorated and it was agreed that the collective morbidity meant that further interventions would be futile.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

(1) During the procedure under local anaesthetic on 25 July 2017 Mr Moran continued to bleed due to the unknown existence of the rupture at that time. He developed hyperkalaemia and was administered an insulin-dextrose infusion. He was to be infused 10 units (0.1ml) on insulin but was mistakenly infused with 100 units (1ml). The serious incident investigation identified that the ST4 Anaesthetist did not use an insulin syringe but instead used a normal 1ml syringe. The use of this syringe was common practice within the anaesthetic department in spite of the issue of alert NPSA/2010/RRR013.
(2) Since 2010 diabetes was removed from the mandatory training requirements across the organisation. As a result there is currently no mandatory training provided to doctors within the Trust to advise them of use of insulin specific devices when drawing up and administering insulin. It is apparent from the action plan that emails have been sent to Consultant Anaesthetists in this regard.

(3) There is currently no process across the organisation to review continued compliance with CAS alerts and ensure that changes made across the Trust still reflect the requirements of previously issued alerts."

The conclusion of the inquest was Jennifer Lewis died at the Darent Valley Hospital, Darenth Wood Road, Darenth on the thirty-first July 2017 as a result of malnutrition due to inadequate provision and intake of sufficient nourishment and nutrition furthered by an inability to appropriate the necessary medical intervention whilst at the Bracton Centre.","Ms Lewis was brought to the emergency department on 21/07/2017 via ambulance from the Bracton Centre at Oxleas NHS Trust.
The admission history states that the nursing staff at the Bracton Centre had been concerned about the poor intake, diarrhoea, confusion, and hypotension.
On observation she had low blood pressure (99/61mmhg), was dehydrated, and tachycardic. She appeared unkempt, lethargic and had reduced responsiveness.
The history shows that diarrhoea started two days prior to admission, and she had a gradual decline in mobility over the two day period and has been noted to be less talkative than normal.
Leg oedema was noted and a healed left leg superficial ulcer.

Working diagnosis of dehydration, sepsis (likely urinary), anaemia, and muteness (long standing) was made. She was treated with IV fluids, dietician referral, and Intravenous antibiotics.

At 9.45 on 20 July 2017 the patient was reviewed and it was noticed that the patient had an unidentified feeding tube (later established to be a surgically inserted PEG) institute which was tied up and not in active use. Further investigation is documented on 24 July that the PEG tube was used for 2 years post insertion, and not used since that time. It is documented that the patient had lost 10kgs since March 2017. The patient had been managed at the Whittington Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital prior to admission to DVH.

CT CAP on 21 July 2017 revealed extensive ascites affecting all peritoneal compartments, with associated oedema of the colon, bilateral pleural effusions and hepatic varices.
CT head scan 21 July NAD.

Medical emergency call was placed on 21 July 2017 due to raised heart rate and low BP. Impression was that she was severely dehydrated, and hypoglycaemic secondary to malnutrition. She was treated with 10% Glucose (IV) IV Pabrinex, and Iv fluids bolus? to keep her blood pressure above 100mmhg systolic.

26th July 2017 reviewed and discussed the possibility of needing parenteral nutrition (PN) as not improving clinically and not able to receive oral/enteral nutrition.
28th July 2017 A central line was inserted on and she was given Total parenteral Nutarian (TPN). This was started at 10mls per hour given the risk of refeeding syndrome. The decision to commence PN was discussed with and agreed with psychiatry consultant.
She became breathless after the commencement of the TPN. A CT scan of the thorax was undertaken (post CVP line insertion and commencement of PN) this revealed a pneumonia.

She was reviewed by the on call Psychiatric liaison team (consultant Psychiatrists on 24 July 2017.

The patient was thought to be Jehovah witness and there was differing information provided by the family members about whether the patient was Jehovah Witness or Presbyterian. Documented in the notes not to give blood products unless the patient was haemodynamically unstable or evidence that she was actively bleeding, and must have consultant approval to do so.

1. It was clear both from the evidence and subsequent correspondence that the correct process for making decisions, such as (but not exclusively), removal of 1:1 observations, is not understood adequately by all parties who should be involved in that decision making process.
2. Whilst the Council understood this to be a multi-disciplinary process involving any professional involved in the patient’s care, the care home, Connaught House, indicated that this decision rests solely with the Council.
3. This is concerning for two reasons. Firstly, the correct procedure is not understood and therefore has not been followed. Secondly, the fact that the care home, where the patient resides is of the view that they are not responsible for making decisions as to removal of observations ahead of transfer. They, in my view, should be pivotal in this decision as the organisation who have had the most contact with the patient and therefore in a position to provide important information as to risk and behaviour.

Following the deceased's cardiac arrest on 8 March 2021, a retrospective review of the telemetry monitoring was carried out and two periods of ventricular standstill were noted - one at 12:43, 6 March 2021 where the telemetry recorded a period of 4 seconds ventricular standstill; and one at 13:09 on 8 March 2021 where the telemetry recorded a period of 10 seconds ventricular standstill.
3. Medical engineers were asked to analyse the telemetry and noted that on 8 March the monitor's alarm had triggered and that it was a self-terminating alarm as the heart rhythm had corrected itself. There was no evidence that staff muted the alarm or that there was any fault with the equipment. Thus, this self-correcting function is an intended function of the monitor.
4. Following the Trust's internal investigations, it was recommended that discussion with the manufacturers of the cardiac monitoring equipment take place to establish whether the alarms can be configured in such a way that the alarm does not self-terminate when certain abnormal heart rhythms correct themselves. The evidence was that this discussion took place on 31 July 2021, but that there has been no progress since that time, with the responsibility now lying with the manufacturer (i.e. yourselves) to develop a software update or alternative system to ensure that the issue of self-terminating alarms is remedied.
5. At inquest, it could not be determined whether Phillips central monitoring stations (model number M3151) are utilised by other Trusts nationally, but given that Philips is one of the largest providers of cardiac monitoring equipment to the NHS, it is presumed that this monitoring station is deployed in other Trusts nationally.
6. I therefore have concerns that, unless immediate consideration is given to this issue by the manufacture (i.e. yourselves), there is a risk of future deaths occurring - both within the Trust and nationally within other Trusts - and will continue to exist in the future until such time as this is addressed."

This response is provided to address the concerns raised by your Regulation 28 report dated 12 December 2024 in which you invite me, on behalf of City of Doncaster Council (""the Council""), to consider the following:

(1) The training of staff regarding the importance of recording instances such as falls and escalating the same.

(2) Following up on recommendations for aids and equipment required to ensure a safe home environment for elderly persons such as Mrs Mullen.

(3) The importance of full and accurate record keeping.

I have been able to consider the aforesaid points with reference to the heads of the relevant services and am able to provide the following information by way of reassurance that the Council's systems of record keeping and communication are robust and effective:

(1) The training of staff regarding the importance of recording instances such as falls and escalating the same:


ll of our social care staff undergo specific training as a matter of course on the need for detailed accurate records to be maintained in care settings, including the recording of slips and falls and general health related events.


s a matter of practice, we use the Mosaic electronic recording system to facilitate our record keeping and all social care staff are fully trained and familiar with the processes involved. Pre-populated forms are available for various tasks, including reports, risk assessments and interactions that need to be recorded and this has the advantage of directing staff to the questions and issues that need to be addressed.

y way of reinforcing this and other aspects of training, front facing social care staff are required to attend one to one supervision sessions on a monthly basis. The purpose of these sessions is to discuss ongoing cases which are specific to that member of staff and to provide the opportunity to raise any issues of concern.

 The discussion of matters of concern is not limited to the monthly sessions and social care workers are constantly engaging with each other and sharing experiences and knowledge to solve any problems arising.

 The need for detailed accurate records to be maintained in care settings is stamped into the DNA of our social care staff, as well as being a key requirement of CQC, whose jurisdiction we are subject to as care providers. We are well aware of our reporting and recording obligations and are fully compliant with these standards and requirements.

 In addition to the measures above, we undertake internal audits on a regular basis to ensure consistency in reporting. Cases are selected on a random basis at the rate of two cases per team per month and the records are scrutinised for discrepancies and any failures to follow up concerns and/or recommendations for referrals etc.

 Care packages are provided by independent care providers who are not associated with the Council, but who are subject to regulation by CQC and who are engaged pursuant to contracts that stipulate the care standards to be expected. They are also required to adhere to the same protocol as the Council in respect of record keeping.

 The records produced by care providers are subject to internal audits by the Council's commissioning department on a regular basis in the same way that the Council's own records are subject to scrutiny.

 The care providers also have their own internal auditing processes and would face significant commercial disadvantage if they failed to adhere to the standards expected. In such event they might lose the benefit of any contracts or more significantly, might be held responsible for any safeguarding issues arising, which had not been properly addressed.

 It should be noted that carers and social care staff are not qualified to diagnose medical conditions or to make recommendations for aids and equipment. Their role is to raise any perceived concerns and to direct the person in question to the relevant professional for advice, usually an occupational therapist, physiotherapist, or District Nurse. All staff are aware of this process and do not require permission to take such steps.

(2) Following up on recommendations for aids and equipment required to ensure a safe home environment for elderly persons such as Mrs Mullen: where a recommendation has been made for aids and equipment, this will be ordered by the professional making the recommendation. The Council will always follow up any delay in provision and assist in any way possible.

Since this incident and as part of ""lessons learnt"" we have set up a ""Home First Forum"" with a view to providing all domiciliary home care providers information as to when and to whom they should direct any referrals. The first event was held on 30 January 2025 and further events will be held on a quarterly basis.

(3) The importance of full and accurate record keeping: the Council is well aware of the importance of full and accurate record keeping and has robust systems in place to ensure that this is maintained, as set out above.

I consider that it might be useful to make some further points to put Mrs Mullen's situation into context and to address some of your observations made in respect of the events leading up to her fall.

I understand that Mrs Mullen was admitted to hospital for several days after a fall from her bed (in the context of suffering with a urinary tract infection) and was discharged home on 22 March 2024. Whilst she was in hospital, a needs assessment was carried out by the Council's STEPS team. This team provides reablement to persons from hospital to home and if care is required, this will be provided by the Council free of charge for 6 weeks.

The STEPS team concluded that Mrs Mullen needed assistance to manage at home and a care package was set up with carers visiting twice a day in the morning and evening. At the same time an assessment was carried out by the NHS occupational therapist, Beverley Hanes, who passed her fit to manage on stairs. Beverley Hanes also visited Mrs Mullen's home the day before the discharge date and maintained her advice in respect of the stairs. This decision was not within the expertise of the Council's social care staff but lay within the expertise of the occupational therapist.

Mrs Mullen did not return home until various remedial measures had been taken by her daughter (the owner of her home) including a general clean up and securing pieces of loose carpet. Mrs Mullen then received reablement care for 6 weeks and no concerns were raised during this period about her ability to manage at home.

At the 6 week point a review was undertaken by the Council ([REDACTED]). It is correct that she did not undertake a stairs assessment. Mrs Mullen had been passed fit to manage on stairs by the occupational therapist and a further assessment was not considered to be necessary. It would not have been within [REDACTED]'s remit to undertake such an assessment in any event. If there had been any concerns about Mrs Mullen's ability to manage stairs, this would have been referred back to Beverly Hanes for further assessment.

Following this review, Mrs Mullen's daily care package continued, with additional care being provided on top 3 days per week to assist her with showering. The care provider was Newdon Care.

The Council does not have any record of Patricia Mullen informing social care that the stairs were becoming too much for her mother and neither was this identified as an issue by the carers. If any concerns had been expressed by Patricia Mullen, the carers or Mrs Mullen herself (who had full capacity), this would have been recorded and investigated.

Mrs Mullen also had daily contact with a neighbour with whom she had a close relationship. The neighbour spent most of each day with Mrs Mullen at her home and was present at the NHS home assessment prior to Mrs Mullen's discharge from hospital. The neighbour did not express any concerns either to social care about any deterioration in her condition.

The reference to the grab rail appears in the Ambulance records and is attributable to the paramedics who attended upon Mrs Mullen after her fall. This suggestion was not taken up by the occupational therapist and would not therefore have been followed up by social care.

Following the Inquest, we have made further enquiries and have established that the reference to the fall in the shower relates to an isolated event that was in fact documented by Newdon Care. I understand that this party was not required to give evidence at the Inquest and therefore this documentation was not available to the Inquest.

As a matter of practice, a single fall event would not be expected to raise a referral. Mrs Mullen was in receipt of care specifically to assist her with showering and any concerns in this respect would have been referred by the carers from Newdon Care to RDaSH for the falls service, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy, in the event that they considered this to be in Mrs Mullen's best interests.

Learning from the incident: we strive as an organisation to improve our practices wherever we can and have reflected at length on the sad outcome for Mrs Mullen. In terms of action to be taken, we will continue to provide training to our staff and will continue to reinforce the need for accurate record keeping, particularly in relation to instances such as falls. We will also reinforce the need for carers and social care staff to escalate any concerns by making appropriate referrals to professionals who will be able to assess the risk and recommend further measures that might need to be put into place to address such risk. This will be further facilitated by the establishment of the ""Home First Forum"".

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance."

Although there was a large element of the patient herself declining contact and care from healthcare providers, her repeat prescriptions (of Cramorph, co-codamol, Amitriptyline and Furosemide) continued despite there being no obvious regular attempt, or any, to assess and check up on her.

Caring for patients refusing patient care is obviously challenging. However, I am concerned that there is a system in place in the future to ensure that these patients are regularly assessed, even if that assessment bears no fruit due to a competent patient declining help. I am reassured that the GP practice has put into place a system now whereby these patients do not get forgotten but this report asks for confirmation of such a system."

From the evidence heard, it does not seem that these concerns have yet been addressed or sufficiently addressed by amendment of the Operational Policy and consequential staff training.

(2) It was apparent from the evidence that the nursing staff who found the Deceased in an unresponsive state on the 12th September 2011did not attempt to resuscitate her in accordance with the guidelines of the Resuscitation Council. They understood that resuscitation should be started if the patient was not “breathing” whereas the Council states that it should be started if the patient is not “breathing normally”.

The evidence heard as to what training the nursing staff had been given concerning when resuscitation should be started was unclear and confusing. It remains unclear whether the resuscitation training now being given to clinical staff (a) is fully and clearly in accordance with the current guidance of the Resuscitation Council and (b) includes training as to what observations should be taken and recorded.

Further, it was apparent from the evidence that the resuscitation bags used by staff contain a laminated aide memoire which is itself misleading as it refers to the use of resuscitation when the patient is not “breathing” rather than “breathing normally”."

Francis Williams was the subject of a sentence of imprisonment for public protection (""IPP""), imposed in 2006.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

My investigation reveals two relevant concerns:

1. That probation officers need to understand, and be constantly alert to, the risk of suicide/self-harm in IPP offenders. It is clear from Mr Williams' case, but also from other cases and other evidence, that this cohort often experiences a particular kind of despair. That is fuelled in part by the particular sense of unfairness that they feel about being on an IPP at all, now the sentence has been abolished and all agree that IPP sentences were a terrible idea. The other factor is the absence of hope of ever getting off it.

2. Linked to that second point, it is crucial that probation officers are also fully versed in the processes for suspending parole licence supervision and then cancelling it altogether. One of the real tragedies of Mr Williams' case is that in 2019 he had been free for ten years, so he should have been referred for licence cancellation. It did not happen, and it is not clear why, but it may have been because no-one was actively looking at him given that his supervision had been suspended. In any event, the referral system did not work and Mr Williams was never referred, at any stage, for cancellation.

Mr Williams was then overtaken by lockdown and related matters in 2020, which pulled the rug on his business and other protective factors, and he then returned to supervision and ultimately recall to prison. Following release in 2022 he was still not referred, and even at the end of that year - which I note was now after the amendments to s.31A of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the introduction of an entitlement to automatic referral to the Parole Board for cancellation - no referral had been made. By then, of course, Mr Williams might have found cancellation much more difficult. However, it is noteworthy that even with those well publicised changes, which Mr Williams had heard about, his probation officer seemed to be struggling to find out how the process worked (entries in the probation records in December 2022 confirm).

Again, the point is that there is a particular kind of despair among the IPP cohort. The main safeguard is the facility for getting off that, or at least giving these men hope that they may be able to get off it. Mr Williams and his probation officer were struggling to find out how to access even that limited (and automatic) safeguard. It was very shortly after that (within a month or so) that he took his life. The jury was clear that the fact of the IPP caused his state of mind and so caused his death.

It seems to me that these two concerns at least give rise to a training need. There may be more. But I consider that action should be taken."

Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14th December 2018. The conclusion was Drug Related (prescription) Accidental death and the medical cause of death was 1a. Morphine Toxicity and Bilateral Rib Fractures 1b. Mechanical Fall 2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease,"On 19.4.18 Janice Davies fell out of bed at home sustaining fractured ribs. She attended the Royal Glamorgan Hospital that day, given 2 x 5ml doses of oramorph, prescribed 4 x 10mls oramorph daily - a supply of around 2 weeks and then, discharged home. She was unable to tolerate the oramorph after around lunchtime on 20.4.18 and following medical advice from her GP, switched to her usual pain killing medication - co-codamol and oxyNorm. Sometime thereafter, the concentration of morphine in her blood reached a toxic level, likely contributed to by her undiagnosed chronic kidney disease (discovered at post mortem examination). This has likely caused respiratory depression, which, on the background of impaired lung function has led to her death at home at [REDACTED] in the early hours of 21.4.18.

In broad terms, the Inquest focused upon:-

a. The appropriateness of the care provided to the deceased at Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 19.4.18 & from her GP on 20.4.18
b. The dosages of oramorph given & prescribed to the deceased at Royal Glamorgan Hospital.
c. The observations of the deceased on 19.4.18
d. The discharging of the deceased on 19.4.18
e. The content of the advice (by telephone) given by her GP on 20.4.18 regarding her toleration of oramorph
f. The causal effects of the dosages of oramorph in the setting of the posthumously identified chronic kidney disease","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) There was an absence of documented (despite indicated) observations of the deceased post her doses of oramorph at around 13:55 hrs & 15.40 hrs on 19.4.18.
(2) There was an absence of an updated & documented pain score prior to discharge. Most significantly, this, on the evidence of [REDACTED] would have been desirable/required to inform the prescribing clinician, [REDACTED] of the most appropriate prescription of oramorph to be given to the deceased upon discharge.
(3) Most significantly, there appeared, on the evidence, to be an absence of formal guidance or instruction-- written or otherwise to clinicians in the Accident & Emergency Department regarding the prescribing of oramorph to discharging patients. This would appear then to give rise to potential inconsistencies in the prescribing of oramorph to discharging patients. Not only in terms of prescribed dosages, but also in respect of the extent of the supply. The deceased was prescribed 40 mls per day & given a supply lasting two weeks. [REDACTED] evidence was that in the absence of clear evidence as to the deceased's tolerance to morphine, he would be uncomfortable with this dosage & supply. His evidence was that a prescription of 20 mls per day, & a supply for 5 days (then review by GP if symptoms persisted/to assess the patient's reaction to the oramorph) was more appropriate in the circumstances."

She was not felt to be suitable for neurosurgical intervention and was pronounced deceased at 19:55 hours on 3rd January 2014. There was a delay in treatment which could have affected the outcome.

The inquest was informed that at the time of Mrs. Lloyd's attendance at the hospital her triage assessment was undertaken by a junior paediatric staff nurse, and that these nurses were sometimes utilised to provide cover in the ambulance triage area when staff shortages ensued. Further, that although Mrs. Lloyd was triaged correctly, that the inexperience of the nurse meant that information that the patient was a very urgent priority was not passed on to either the nursing staff for the relevant area or a senior doctor and so was not acted upon as an emergency.

The inquest was told by an independent Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine that given the patient was suffering from a time critical lesion any delays in assessment, diagnosis and treatment must be regarded as contributory factors to a poor outcome and that certain aspects of her care could and should have been addressed more promptly in terms of:

 Medical assessment within 10 minutes of triage;
 Initial neurological observations including assessment of pupils and Glasgow Coma Score, plus ongoing regular monitoring of her neurological state starting with every 10 to 15 minutes;
 A more immediate response to a history of warfarin use and findings of a raised INR requiring treatment;
 CT scanning of the head should have taken place as soon as possible after arrival and certainly within one hour of arrival;
 Earlier discussion with the Neurosurgical team.

The Consultant further informed the inquest that having triaged the patient and designated her as a ""very urgent"" priority and then doing nothing about it was completely unacceptable. He added that it is also unacceptable that it was over two hours before Mrs. Lloyd had a second GCS score recorded by an examining doctor and that there was then a further long delay before a GCS score was taken again and recorded on an observation chart. Also, he felt there too long a delay in administering drugs to reverse the effect of warfarin therapy in someone who was actively bleeding.

He concluded that it is vital that the Trust undertake a review of this case to address these areas to ensure that any future patients with time critical neurosurgical lesions have prompt assessment, investigation, referral and transfer to optimise the potential for a better outcome.",See the contents of section 3 above.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  	6

At the conclusion of the inquest, I indicated to the Properly Interested Persons that I proposed to write to the Trust by way of a report in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.

 During the Inquiry, I received written evidence a review has taken place further to this incident, and that it is now only the very senior paediatric nurses who are able to triage and that a triage training plan has been implemented which is to be completed by all nurses who triage and is designed to ensure all triage staff are able to assess and direct initial care for patients and ensure they are placed in the most appropriate area post triage.

 I was further informed that changes made to departmental policy have incorporated the necessity to consider the effects of patients treated with warfarin, and that A & E consultants are working to improve and implement an

However, having concluded this inquest, I now write to the Trust to confirm that in my view the Trust should take action because:

Although encouraged by the steps being taken, I remain concerned that the procedures in place at the hospital are insufficiently robust, and that staffing levels do not provide the Trust with sufficient resilience, to enable the Trust to minimise the risks of further deaths in similar circumstances particularly given the criticisms made by the independent expert and the number of areas of concern he raises.

I would therefore be obliged if the Trust would write to me in due course to confirm what steps if any the Trust proposes to take to address these areas of concern."

The inquest concluded on the 29th July 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was ""Unlawful Killing"", the medical case of death was 1a Incised wound to the throat and blunt force trauma to the head.","On the twenty second of January 2013 Chloe Siokos was found in a kitchen at her home having been killed by her husband who had set a fire in the house before hanging himself.

There were 3 relevant factors :-
That Mrs Siokos shared a home with Mr Siokos. That Mrs Siokos was subject to a pattern of abuse by Mr Siokos over a number of years. That Mr Siokos had, at some point, begun to suffer a deterioration in mental health leading to a delusional state of mind.

Mr Siokos had no history of psychiatric illness and he never showed any psychotic ideation.

On the 16th January 2013 the GP telephoned to speak to Mr Siokos but spoke to Mrs Siokos instead. Mrs Siokos asked the doctor if it was about the results of the X-ray that was undertaken on the 11th January 2013. The doctor explained that it was. Mrs Siokos then called for Mr Siokos to come down from upstairs, the portion of the house where he lived separate from Mrs Siokos, The doctor explained that there was a problem with the X-ray and that Mr Siokos would need to be seen urgently the following day. Mr Siokos then asked the doctor to speak to Mrs Siokos again and it was agreed that Mrs Siokos would bring him in to see a different doctor .

Concerns were raised at the inquest about whether in the circumstances, that Mr and Mrs Siokos lived separately at the same address, had separate door bells and Council Tax and largely lived separate lives an interpreter should have been used.

Concerns were also raised that when looking at Mr Siokos's GP notes there was no flag to indicate that it may not be appropriate to use Mrs Siokos as an interpreter for Mr Siokos.

Mrs Siokos did accompany Mr Siokos to that appointment and again assisted with interpreting what was said.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

That there was no framework for primary care staff to make a decision when an interpreter is required.

That interpreters should be available to primary care staff more readily

That there is no system of flagging to alert primary care staff to the need to consider the care provided to a patient in the context of another patient where that is relevant."

Equalities, Rights and Decency Group, The Ministry Of Justice, Clive House, 70 Petty France, London SW1H 9EX","On 13/02/2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Andrew Douglas Frere, 34. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 September 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that he took his own life whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed.","On 19th January 2014 Andrew Frere self harmed whilst a prisoner at HMP Moorland, Doncaster. He was placed on an ACCT, which remained open and which was subject to 11 reviews under the ACCT procedure until 10 February 2014, when he died as a result of suspending himself by a ligature formed from a bedsheet in his cell.

He was initially placed on continuous observation and for this purpose was moved from the houseblock where he was located to a gated cell in the Induction Wing. He was diagnosed as suffering from depression with some psychotic features, and appeared in particular to have concerns about returning to reside on the houseblock and about which would happen following his forthcoming release from prison. As regards the former concern, although he clearly felt more comfortable on the Induction Wing, it was recognised that long-term residence on that wing was not practicable, and that he would have to be reintegrated onto the houseblock at some point. It was also recognised that it was undesirable for him to remain under constant observation for any longer than was necessary.

Andrew Frere appears to have made good progress under the ACCT, but the improvement was not without setbacks during which he felt low in mood and expressed suicidal ideation. Those were appropriately recorded in the ACCT ongoing record.

At the ninth review, held on 31 January 2014, the level of observation was reduced to one per hour. At the tenth review, on 4 February 2014, it was decided to move him back to his cell in the houseblock. At the eleventh review, on 7 February 2014, this level of observation was further reduced to 6 per 24 hours. He hanged himself in his cell during a short period when prisoners were locked up for lunch, between 12.30 pm and 1.30 pm.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) Prison Service Instruction 64/2011 requires that prisoners under continuous observation should be seen by a doctor very 24 hours. The evidence given at the inquest indicated that this was not practicable, and the rule was widely recognised as not being so practicable.

My concern is less or to the apparent impracticability of the PSI, but more that, this impracticability having been recognised, the rule appears to have been ignored, rather than any attempt having been made at least to comply as closely as possible. Since Andrew Frere's death this is now done at HMP Moorland by having nursing staff see the prisoner when a doctor is not available, but the problem with the impracticability of the PSI appears to be national, rather than a local one, and ought to be the subject of some sort of guidance at national level.

(2) The PSI does not appear to include any specific instruction that the case manager, or others attending ACCT review, should ensure that they read the ongoing observations, at least as far back as the previous review, in order to ensure that they are aware of recent events when they carry out such a review.

My concern is that potentially important information, which might affect decisions taken at the review, may be missed if the recent observations are not read."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
1. The intermediate care arrangement at Darnton House, I was informed, was a joint venture between L and M Health care and Tameside Hospital, but there seems to have been inadequate planning and unclear rules as to the level and type of management required for the patients/residents. Was the required standard that of a hospital or that of a care home. No-one seemed to know and this led to general uncertainty.
2. Perhaps as a result of the problems highlighted at (1) above, the ward appears to have been inadequately staffed, both as to numbers of staff and the level of expertise thereof.
3. The staff, or some of them, who gave evidence at the inquest, had either failed to read the medical/nursing notes, or if they had so read them, they had failed to understand them. The consultant surgeon had clearly indicated that the patient was to mobilise and was able to fully weight-bear, however for the whole of the week she spent in this ward she was nursed in bed and not mobilised at all.
4. There was no apparent handover from the hospital to this ward, as to the individual needs of the patient, and the staff were therefore placed in an impossible position.
5. Mrs Kirkham was moved to the intermediate care ward on a Friday preceding a bank-holiday weekend, and despite the clear indication that she was to have physiotherapy, none was arranged for four days after her arrival.
6. Despite the request from me as HM Senior Coroner, it appears that no records were available relating to the whole of her stay in this ward."

The medical cause of death was vascular dementia.,"Philip Allen was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2009. In September 2012 following a deterioration in his condition he was transferred from The Oaks Care Centre to QEH where he died.

Mr Allen was admitted to The Oaks on or around 6 June 2012.

Not only was this advice not followed but the Quetiapine, which [REDACTED] had stopped, continued to be prescribed as a repeat prescription on several occasions.

The evidence at the inquest was that the further prescriptions of Quetiapine did not contribute to the death. However, I am concerned that the system at Eltham Palace Surgery did not prevent the repeat prescription. [REDACTED] was unable to say if changes have been made since this incident."

He elected to undergo surgery for the removal of the tumour which took place on 1st May 2015. During the lengthy and complex surgery he developed several episodes of abnormal heart rhythm which caused the surgery to be suspended. The surgery was eventually completed, successfully, and he was taken to the intensive care unit for further support.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

During the evidence it transpired that an ECG test which was undertaken on 21st April 2015 was not available to the reviewing consultant anaesthetists prior to surgery. The evidence suggested that there was a problem within the hospital, not specific to ECG tests whereby results from investigative tests and scans are not kept with the patient's medical notes. In this instance, it appeared that there was a facility for the result of the ECG to be electronically uploaded onto the hospital computer system but this had not happened. The evidence at the hearing suggested that this was a not uncommon problem. In this case the unavailability of the scan was not in any way causative of Mr Parry's death but could have been.

During the evidence it became clear that whilst in intensive care an intravenous line administering noradrenaline was disconnected from Mr Parry which caused his blood pressure to drop significantly to the point of requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The evidence indicated that it was likely this line was disconnected by one of the attending nurses by ""accident"" as the line was not labelled as best practise dictates. The evidence revealed that there were no labels for the line to be labelled with and there is no protocol requiring intravenous lines to be labelled to ensure that they are not accidentally disconnected, for example, when other drugs are administered. The evidence clearly showed that if the noradrenaline line had been clearly labelled it would not have been disconnected as the nurses and medical team within the critical care unit would fully appreciate the implication to the patient."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

Steven Trudgill had a long and complex mental health history dating back to his childhood with a range of different treatments and different possible diagnoses.

It was also clear that he had formed good and meaningful longstanding therapeutic relationships with mental health professionals in the recent past and, although he had expressed a wish not to go onto the mental health caseload in his new prison during his short time adjusting and settling in after his transfer to HMP Highpoint, he had been cooperative and compliant with treatment in the past (after a period of non compliance), and there was no reason to believe from the detailed picture that the evidence gave of Steven, that this could not be achievable again.

He was clearly a young man with some insight and some complex mental health issues, and the firesetting offences and behaviour, longstanding in his case, for which he had been convicted was a form of behaviour, according to the forensic psychologists' report, that could, in some cases, have a significant underlying psychological component. The same detailed psychological report also identified five main factors which had been recognised to underlie deliberate fire setting behaviour, and found they could all be related to Steven's own history. It was also stated that there are currently no standardised treatment programmes for fire setters available within HM Prison Service, and a pilot that had been running was no longer accepting referrals.

A Therapeutic Community, after further assessment of Steven's personality, was a suggested option for Steven's care and treatment, but this option, also contained in the same psychology report prepared for the probation service in advance of any future parole hearing, was never taken forward as Steven sadly died before any further parole hearing took place."

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 18th December 2024.

The Medical Cause of Death was:

1a Hanging

The conclusion of the Inquest recorded that Alexander Channing died as a consequence of suicide in circumstances where decisions were made at the time of discharge from hospital on 19/1/22 not to involve the Home Treatment Team and to postpone a Community Mental Health Team meeting on 25/1/22 which has led to missed opportunities to reassess his risk of suicide, the last missed opportunity being two days before his death.","In 2021 Alec had been diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. He had been detained in hospital under s.2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 between 29/7/21 and 11/8/21. Following discharge he was seen by the Home Treatment Team and then the Community Mental Health Team. There was a delay in the transfer of care from the Community Mental Health Team based where his family lived to the Community Mental Heath Team in his university town.

It was believed that the transfer could not take place until he had registered with a GP surgery in his university town. The referral was opened by the new Community Mental Health Team on 24/11/21. Alec was detained in hospital under s.2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 between 7/1/22 and 19/1/22. On discharge a decision was made not to involve the Home Treatment Team. An appointment was fixed for Alec to meet with the Community Mental Health Team on 25/1/22 for an assessment. Alec contracted Covid on or around 25/1/22 and the assessment meeting was postponed as it was deemed necessary for there to be a face to face assessment. On 27/1/22 Alec was found suspended by a ligature in his room at his university halls of residence. Paramedics attended and pronounced him dead at the scene. Dorset Police investigated and found no suspicious circumstances.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. The number of students commencing or resuming studies following the Covid 19 pandemic with mental health issues and requiring support from the wellbeing services at Arts University Bournemouth has significantly increased.

ii. Alec was to be transferred from the Community Mental Health Team in his home town to the Community Mental Health Team in his university town. The transferring CMHT were unaware that it was possible to arrange a direct transfer to the receiving CMHT without the need for Alec to be first registered with a GP surgery in his university town.

iii. Alec was admitted to a district hospital on 7/1/22 and seen by the Liaison Psychiatry Team. Following a decision to discharge Alec from hospital it was decided that a referral to the Home Treatment Team was unnecessary. Alec was discharged to a date provided by the CMHT in his university town. There was no involvement of that CMHT in his discharge planning.

iv. Alec had initially indicated that he would consent for information to be shared with others but that consent was withdrawn. There was no pro active approach taken by the CMHT in his home town to seek his consent to share information.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. There is no training provided to the wellbeing services at the Arts University Bournemouth in relation to students diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.

ii. There appears to be a failure amongst staff at the Exter CMHT to appreciate that there can be a direct transfer of a patient's care to another CMHT Trust without the need for a patient to have to first register with a GP surgery

iii. There was a lack of involvement of a responsible clinician in the process of discharge planning from the district hospital in Exeter to the care of Bournemouth CMHT at Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.

iv. There is no policy in place at Devon Partnership NHS Trust which encourages a repeated proactive approach in seeking consent from a patient to share information at relevant times."

The doctors caring for him decided to administer Phenytoin, an anti-epileptic medication. The junior doctor instructed to administer the drug sought advice from a more senior doctor as to the dose to be administered. As a result of a failure in verbal communication between the doctors, aggravated as both were masked, a dose of 15 mg/kg was heard as 50 mg/kg and an overdose was administered.

The medical cause of death was:
1a upper gastrointestinal bleed and haemorrhagic shock
1b oesophageal tear extending to the aorta
1c foreign body in oesophagus.","Kazarie died as a result of swallowing a foreign body (a googly eye) in February 2022.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

In February 2022, Kazarie was taken to hospital suspected of having swallowed a plastic foreign object. He then underwent an x-ray and a fluoroscopy, each with a negative result.

It was suggested to me in evidence that children suspected of having swallowed a non radio opaque object such as a googly eye, whose symptoms (unlike Kazarie’s) persist, should undergo an endoscopy even if they have had a negative x-ray and fluoroscopy.

I was told that there is a lack of national guidance for such a situation. I appreciate that there are multiple considerations in planning investigations, such as the risks associated with CT scanning and the risks associated with the administration of a general anaesthetic. It seems that the matter would benefit from consideration at a national level."

The investigation concluded following an inquest in June 2018 where the Jury's narrative conclusion (copy attached) was to the effect that Mr Bingham died from injuries received when he was hit by a police vehicle whilst crossing the A61 Penistone Road at Owlerton Green.,"Mr Bingham had approached the A61 along Owlerton Green on his way to a family celebration at the Greyhound Stadium. He was not affected by drink or other substances. The exact path taken from the kerb on the West side of Penistone Rd (ie: adjacent to the Pizza Hut) is unknown but Mr Bingham got safely onto the first pedestrian refuge which is roughly triangular in shape. At this point he had only crossed the lane for traffic turning left into Owlerton Green and still had the two northbound lanes of the A61 to cross. The evidence was that Mr Bingham then stepped into the northbound lanes of the A61 notwithstanding the approaching police vehicle. It is clear that the traffic lights for the police vehicle were on green.
The final conclusion of the jury as to the crossing itself reflected evidence (and in particular a viewing) as regards the positioning of the red/green pedestrian indicator lights on the triangular refuge. Mr Bennett from the City Council was present throughout and can no doubt assist you further but in summary the jury feared that a pedestrian approaching from Owlerton Green might be misled by a green pedestrian light intended only for those crossing the mouth of Owlerton Green in a northbound direction. The sequence is such that this (first) light will be green for a large part of the time that the pedestrian indicator to cross the northbound lanes of Penistone Road is red. The first light has been designed to be particularly bright with a narrow viewing angle but it is highly visible to those approaching from Owlerton Green, particularly if the corner to reach the refuge is cut very slightly. The jury were plainly of the view that Mr Bingham may have had only this bright green light in mind as he progressed towards the refuge and thought that this gave him clearance to cross the A61 in front of the approaching traffic which he may well have assumed was being shown a red light.
I would respectfully agree with the jury's conclusion on this point. Whilst this is a difficult junction to provide for, it remains a significant hazard with a high likelihood of serious injury for anyone who makes this error.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed a matter giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.
In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows --
The evidence showed that there was a significant possibility that a pedestrian approaching the A61 from Owlerton Green adjacent to the Pizza Hut may be misled by a green light intended for pedestrians crossing the mouth of Owlerton Green and thus miss a red light prohibiting them crossing the northbound lanes of the A61.

Upon the arrival of the police he was recovered face down in the water and was found to have passed away.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26th November 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mrs Miller had died from natural causes.",N/A: Not found,"The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) Mrs Miller's notes and records were unavailable to the GP surgery at Broughton Gate despite having been transferred to the surgery, following the closure of the Willen practice in April 2013. Indeed I was informed by a GP who gave evidence before me that she was still, in November 2013, unable to access the patient records. Over 2000 patients were transferred to Broughton Gate and if the circumstance above continues there is a possibility that lives will be put at risk.

(2) On the 23rd July 2013 the GP had requested the district nurses to attend Mrs Miller to carry out an urgent blood test. The GP was dismayed to discover a week later that the blood sample had not been taken and that the results, therefore, were not available to her. There appears to be no system for effective communication between the GP surgery and the district nurses. Again this gives rise to a concern that lives may be at risk.

(3) During the inquest hearing it became apparent that the surgery at Broughton Gate did not have access to a pulse oximeter to measure Mrs Miller's oxygenation. This is a relatively inexpensive item and should perhaps be available in every doctor's surgery throughout the country.

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by January 23rd 2014. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Jan Bagley, Counsellor","On 4th August 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Victoria Georgia Halliday.

The Inquest concluded on 23rd September 2016.

Cause of death:

1a Hanging","Narrative.
Vicki's mental health started to deteriorate in the early part of 2015 following a year of stability. She was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and admitted for inpatient care in the Bradgate unit, Leicester for diagnosis and treatment. She was diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder.
The plan was to care for Vicki in the community with expected ongoing brief admissions in times of crisis.
During June and July 2015 Vicki repeatedly presented in crisis. Numerous missing person reports required police involvement across various geographical locations and she was brought back for psychiatric assessment in Leicester due to concerns for her and the public's safety. On each occasion she was discharged back into the community. There was no effective or robust community support.
Ample evidence was available to suggest that Vicki was starting to experience psychotic symptoms from May onwards, but opportunities were missed to fully and adequately explore these and reconsider the necessity for in-patient care.
On 29 July the final missing person search was commenced. Vicki was discovered to have taken her own life, but her intent could not be established given the well-documented bizarre thought processes she had been experiencing.","1) There are currently no local psychiatric intensive care unit beds for female patients and this means all female patients can only be placed out of area, potentially many miles away from home and local support.

2) There was no, or no effective, community psychiatric nurse involvement and this was a missed opportunity to monitor and assist Victoria when she was in the community.

3) The ""community support"" referred to by the in-patient clinicians does not exist in reality for patients with this challenging presentation, leaving discharged patients and their families without adequate support.

4) The care programme approach (CPA) was not adhered to and NICE guidelines were not followed, specifically in ensuring there was a review after 2 admissions within 6 months, and to ensure the roles and responsibilities of all health and social care professionals involved were identified.

5) There is no local network for the community support of patients diagnosed with personality disorder, although evidence suggested such networks were effective when adopted elsewhere."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17th December 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was a short form conclusion as follows:

""Joanna Sarah Louise Orpin killed herself.""

The medical cause of death was found to be:
1a Multiple Traumatic Injuries.
1b
1c
II","1) Joanna Sarah Louise Orpin was born on 19th January 1976. At the time of her death she was 42 years old and worked as a Senior Recruitment Consultant.

2) In late November 2017 Miss Orpin had developed a lingering cough and chest infection and visited her GP who prescribed her antibiotics.

3) She had two teleconsultations with a GP at her practice on 16th and 19th January. During the course of the latter one, it was clear that she was highly stressed, agitated and anxious, so her GP prescribed Diazepam for her severe anxiety. A further review was diarised for 22nd January.

4) At the consultation on 22nd January, it was clear to her GP that she was still very anxious and agitated and was not sleeping, so she was prescribed Mirtazepine and a referral was made to Primary Care ""Improving Access to Psychological Therapies"".

5) Miss Orpin's mother contacted the GP the following day (23rd January 2018) to say that her daughter was still struggling to sleep and remained anxious.

6) On 24th January 2018, Miss Orpin attended the GP's surgery and was seen in an emergency appointment. The GP assessed her as being very anxious and she expressed many negative thoughts and a feeling of worthlessness. She had no active suicidal plans but had thoughts of not wanting to be there. Her presentation was both unkempt and agitated. The GP arranged for an urgent referral to the Hospital Mental Health Team due to her agitated depression deteriorating so significantly over a short period of time. A face-to-face assessment was booked for the following day with a Mental Health Nurse. Again, her presentation was described as being severely anxious, agitated and restless. She paced around the room as she spoke. The Nurse referred her on to the Home Treatment Team and arranged an appointment with a Consultant Psychiatrist the next day. Her medication had been increased to include Zopiclone and Quetiapine, but her presentation had not altered from agitated depression.

7) The Home Treatment team indicated that they planned to visit Miss Orpin daily to help her manage her mental health crisis. These visits commenced on 27th January 2018 except when Miss Orpin requested a family day with her partner and two young sons. They were interspersed with appointments to titrate her medication. Her agitated depression remained resistant to treatment. Miss Orpin's presentation varied a little on occasion, and she had better days as well as days when she continued to feel deeply anxious and agitated.

8) By 7th February 2018, Miss Orpin had asked to reduce the Home Treatment Team's visits to every third day. In reality, she declined visits over 5 consecutive days before agreeing to be visited again by the Home Treatment Team on 12th February 2018. On that occasion she was feeling very low; she was tearful and anxious. She didn't believe that her medication was working, and she had become stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. She had no suicidal plan or intent. She agreed to a visit from a Consultant Psychiatrist the following day. As with all her other visits from the Home Treatment Team, no risk of harm was identified, and she underwent a Mental State Examination and assessment of capacity.

9) The following morning, 13th February 2018, Miss Orpin woke up early and went downstairs to feed her sons breakfast and hot chocolate whilst her partner slept. She then told the children that she was going to go for a run, which is something she hadn't done for a while. By the time her partner woke up she had gone and taken the car – something she wasn't supposed to do whilst on these potent medications.

10) Miss Orpin's partner immediately took their boys out to search for her. She was not at the local Tesco supermarket, and when he drove up to Culver Cliff, he did not see her vehicle there. Having dropped the boys with Miss Orpin's mother, he heard that Miss Orpin's car had now been located in the car park at Culver Cliff. (It was later discovered that she had stopped off to buy some cigarettes at a shop en route to Culver Cliff.) Miss Orpin's partner immediately returned to discover a large police presence which Miss Orpin's disappearance, as a vulnerable person due to her fragile mental state, had generated.

11) Amongst the Police personnel present was a dog handler whose dog tracked Miss Orpin's scent approximately a quarter of a mile from the car park, where she had left her unlocked car, to a kissing gate in the main fence which runs along the length of the cliff edge. It was at that point that Miss Orpin's scent could be detected no longer, and the logical inference was that she had crossed over the kissing gate and protective fence at that point. Later, her car keys and mobile phone were found and had been thrown approximately 5 metres from this point. It should be mentioned that the weather conditions on this day were atrocious with high winds which would have forced anyone back inland from the edge of the cliff, with cold rain coming in sideways. No trace of Miss Orpin could be found on that date.

12) Whilst Miss Orpin's trainers were found at the base of the cliff at a later date, Miss Orpin's body was not located until 18th February 2018 when she was found naked on mudflats at Bosham Quay, Chichester, West Sussex.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: –

1. I heard evidence from Inspector [REDACTED] that there are at least 3 or 4 people per month who are found in a state of mental distress at Culver Cliff who require the assistance of the Police or other agencies to ensure their safety.

2. I was also informed that whilst there used to be signs at the top of Culver Cliff akin to those which are found at Beachy Head in East Sussex and the Itchen Bridge in Southampton which have wording such as ""Suicidal? Despairing? Call Samaritans on [local number]"", these signs appear to no longer be present.

3. During the course of his evidence, Inspector [REDACTED] told the Inquest that he had made recommendations for these signs to be displayed approximately 3 years ago, and he was aware that a Consultant Psychiatrist had made similar recommendations within the last 12 months. Concerns had been ventilated in relation to how many signs would be required and at what intervals. It was the opinion of Inspector [REDACTED] that just a small number of strategically placed signs (perhaps in the car park, and at various intervals along the length of the fence as well as at places where it is easier to cross the protective fence at the kissing gate) would be adequate – in his words, ""If they save just one life, then it would be worthwhile."" I agree with his views.

4. I also heard evidence from [REDACTED], a Consultant Psychiatrist at the Isle of Wight NHS Trust that he sits on a Suicide Prevention Group, and they had also tried to get these signs reinstated at the top of Culver Cliff, to no avail."

1b) Road Traffic Collision (driver)

The jury made the following factual determinations: ""Mr Rogivska died at the scene of a road traffic collision on 14th December 2016 at the junction between Carr House Road and Cooper Lane, Shelf, Halifax. Factors which contributed to the collision were that Mr Rogivska was an inexperienced driver under the influence of cannabis and he entered the corner too fast to safely negotiate it.

In further addition, Mr Rogivska collided, not with another vehicle, but into a domestic property abutting the opposite carriageway of Carr House Road from where he had entered Carr House Road from Cooper Lane. Reconstruction evidence was given to the effect that Mr Rogivska entered the junction at 45 mph, when the maximum speed his intended left turn could have been negotiated while remaining in his appropriate carriageway was 20mph.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The Coroner's short-form conclusion was that of ""suicide"".

The family's concern at inquest related to the University's long waiting list for Mental Health Adviser support; a failure to expedite Daniel for mental health support knowing that he had expressed suicidal ideation and suffered ASD; and the lack of safeguarding by the University.","These were recorded as :-

On 29 September 2019 and 23 October 2019 Daniel had face to face meetings with Nurse Adviser, [REDACTED] as a part of his DSA Needs Assessment. On both occasions he expressed suicidal thoughts.

[REDACTED] signposted Daniel to the 'Request for Support' form and the Samaritans. Following completion of these forms Daniel received confirmation on 17 and 22 October 2019 that his name had been placed on a waiting list to see a Mental Health Adviser. Due to ill-health and absences of the University's three Mental Health Advisers, there were ~200 students awaiting mental health support. Daniel was 16th on the waiting list to be seen.

Daniel was prescribed antidepressant medication by his GP on 30 October 2019 but failed to attend his follow-up appointment on 27 November 2019. [REDACTED], noting this failed appointment arranged for Daniel to be seen by the GP on 29 November 2019 and again on 11 December 2019. His antidepressant was providing little 'mood elevating' cover.

On 15 November 2019 a referral was made for Specialist Mentor support and [REDACTED] was allocated to support Daniel on 21 November 2019 and she introduced herself to him at a meeting on 3 December 2019. There is no attendance note of this meeting or arrangements made for further contact.

British Society of Dermatological Surgery","On 21st February 2024 I concluded an investigation into the death of Dr Alan William Kingsbury.

The medical cause of death recorded was:-

1a Pneumonia

1b Fractured right neck of femur (repaired surgically 21/10.23)

1c Fall secondary to anaemia, secondary to bleeding chest wall lesion (excised squamous cell cancer 19.10.23)

3 Severe frailty of Old Age

I returned a narrative conclusion:

Dr Alan William Kingsbury was extremely frail with poor physiological reserve. On the 19th October 2023 he was admitted into Worthing Hospital, Worthing as an emergency for excessive bleeding secondary to an excision of a left cutaneous chest lesion (squamous cell carcinoma in situ) earlier that day whilst anticoagulated with aspirin and clopidogrel.

In the early hours of 21st October 2023 Dr Kingsbury had a fall in the hospital in circumstances whereby neither a sitting and lying blood pressure or a falls assessment had not been undertaken. He sustained a right neck of femur fracture requiring surgical repair later that day alongside further surgical revision of the chest wound for dehiscence and ongoing bleeding.

The combination of frailty, ongoing bleeding from the chest wound and complications of the fall all contributed to his death at the hospital on 29th October 2023",The conclusion reflects the circumstances of Dr Kingsbury's death.,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. BSDS (British Society of Dermatological Surgery) Guidelines on Anti-thrombotics and skin surgery for dermatological excisions in the community.

The guidelines as to the suitability of maintaining patients' anti-thrombotic medication prior to surgical excision are insufficiently robust to reflect bleeding potential from a myriad of factors including the condition of the skin being excised, the position of the lesion and the underlying frailty and medical co-morbidities of individuals requiring dermatological surgery in the community. Dr Kingsbury was extremely frail taking Aspirin and Clopidogrel. The lesion to be excised was on the upper chest wall with extremely fragile skin and the excision was larger than expected with some difficulty in obtaining primary closure.

2. The lack of a Preoperative assessment and advanced consent

Dr Kingsbury was not assessed or consented either in person or by telephone consultation prior to the day of the procedure against current accepted guidelines for surgical procedures. No risk/benefit analysis was undertaken as to the suitability of undertaking the procedure whilst Dr Kingsbury was taking Aspirin and Clopidogrel. Mrs Kingsbury made multiple attempts at communicating with the service without success to obtain advice as to the necessity or otherwise of discontinuing the anticoagulants.

3. Guidance as to the appropriateness of the surgical technique for wound closure

Evidence was heard that due to the fragility of the skin the initial wound closure was not sufficiently deep to effectively achieve haemostasis, requiring closure at a muscular level with different suture technique."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 March 2017. I made a narrative determination at inquest, which I attach. I recorded the medical cause of death as:

1a multiple injuries including ruptured left kidney.","Mariana Pinto jumped from the third floor balcony of her home as a deliberate act, but without a proper understanding of what she was doing.

She had attended the emergency department of the Homerton University Hospital the day before and had been assessed as not detainable under the Mental Health Act.

On the day of her death, her husband called the City and Hackney Crisis Line at lunch time and was told that she would receive a home visit between 5 and 7pm. He then called back at 3.32pm, explaining that his wife was deteriorating rapidly and needed to see someone urgently.

Half an hour later, Mariana Pinto jumped.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. It seemed to me at inquest that, when Ms Pinto left the emergency department the day before her death, the limitations of the crisis team were not made clear to her family and friends.

2. The view of the psychiatrists treating Ms Pinto in the emergency department was that she was suffering cannabis withdrawal, which I heard is generally at its worst during the first three days.

Her symptoms were now quiescent, but it would have been very helpful for her family to know that, most particularly as she had taken cannabis the night before, once the lorazepam wore off she might well have a resurgence of symptoms though these were not expected to be as severe as they had been. Worsening advice could then have been delivered in this context, with a clear plan of action.

It is a theme I have noticed in deaths such as Ms Pinto's, that clinicians' expectations of illness progression are not necessarily communicated effectively to families, to enable families to identify unexpected deterioration and then to act swiftly and appropriately.

3. The band 7 mental health nurse who took the call to the crisis line at 3.32pm on 16 October, did not suggest to Ms Pinto's husband that [REDACTED] call the emergency services while the nurse rang Ms Pinto and spoke to her to offer what support he could.

When [REDACTED] told him that the situation was now urgent, the nurse responded that the time for home visits was 5-7pm.

After the call had ended, the nurse did not discuss with colleagues the potential to bring the home visit forward.

The nurse did not ring the emergency services himself in case [REDACTED] had been unable to make the call."

1a) Alcohol, Citalopram, Codeine, Paracetamol and Propranolol Toxicity

2) Bronchopneumonia, alcohol dependence and depression

In box 3 of the Record of Inquest I recorded how, when and where Heather came by her death as follows:-

""Heather was confirmed dead at 1838 on Sunday 22 June 2019 by an attending paramedic at a location on waste ground to the south of The Recycling Centre, Churchfields Industrial Estate, Salisbury, Wiltshire. Earlier that afternoon against a background of excess alcohol consumption Heather consumed excess amounts of Paracetamol (88mg/l blood), Codeine (1.6mg/l blood), Propranolol (4.2mg/l blood). The combination of the above more likely than not led to respiratory depression and death. Heather also had a developing bronchopneumonia which more likely than not contributed to the mechanism of her death. Heather was dependant on alcohol and also more likely than not was suffering from depression both of which contributed to her actions.""

Having considered the evidence I felt that there was insufficient evidence to make a finding of fact, on a balance of probabilities that Heather had intended to take her own life at the time, she took the medication in conjunction with previous alcohol consumption and I therefore recorded as a conclusion one of Drugs/Alcohol related.","Heather was a homeless lady having lost both her parents during her teens. A forensic psychiatrist was of the view that she did have mental health problems although sadly for Heather, whilst having mental capacity she appeared to be reluctant to engage with mental health professionals.

As part of the investigation and although Heather actually died on the 22 June 2018, she had come into contact with the Police on 17 and 18 June 2018 the latter of which she had been arrested and taken to Melksham Police Station. Whilst at the police station she was subject to an alcohol withdrawal assessment which did include a mental health assessment undertaken by a paramedic. A decision was taken later the same evening to release Heather back into the community. There was no finding of any failure on part of either the Police or the healthcare professionals insofar as the care afforded to Heather whilst a Melksham Police Station. The investigation did however as part of the wider investigation give rise to some matters which are of concern to me which I have addressed in the next section,","At the final hearing I heard evidence from [REDACTED] who was the paramedic involved in the assessment of Heather on 18 June 2018. He had primarily been called to give evidence so that I could understand a little more in terms of the process by which a detained person is medically assessed whilst in police detention and also there was an issue in relation to the recording of his findings which needed to be raised with [REDACTED]

What arose during the questioning was a problem which may affect other healthcare professionals in a similar situation and in respect of which may cause a problem that may lead to a future death if not addressed. Wiltshire Police contract with G4S Health Services (UK) Ltd in relation to the provision of healthcare services at their custody suites in Wiltshire and Swindon. Principally due to the ever-increasing challenges that people with mental health issues present to front line emergency services, Wiltshire Police operate an arrangement called ""Street Triage"" whereby 24 hours a day there is a mental health professional available at the Force Control Room with full access to mental health records. Working alongside the G4S healthcare professionals, at least between the hours of 0800hrs-2000hrs, are personnel from the Liaison and Diversion Service (LADS). Coincidentally the same healthcare trust is responsible for the provision of both those services. As you will appreciate when somebody is in state detention, the state is under an obligation having regard to Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights to safeguard life in those circumstances. One of the concerns that arose relates to G4S healthcare professionals and any other healthcare professional in this situation when asked to carry out a front line assessment which could include mental health features, that those individuals may not have the fullest amount of information that is available so that they can make an informed decision as to whether or not for example further healthcare input is required, such as for example a formal mental health at assessment. Whilst a problem insofar as getting a complete picture did not seem to be quite such an issue when personnel from LADS were available it would appear that out of those hours, if a G4S healthcare professional wanted to make enquiries insofar as an individual's mental health background which potentially might be within the knowledge of the relevant healthcare trust, that when an approach is made to the Street Triage team out of hours that more often than not the issue of confidentiality was raised to withhold information or I felt that equally there was a danger that selective information might only be passed at best to the G4S healthcare operative. The concern that I was left with was that the healthcare professionals from G4S and arguably at the end of the day Wiltshire Police whose ultimate responsibility it is to safeguard life when an individual is in Police custody are effectively trying to do a job, through their contract service providers (G4S), in circumstances whereby in trying to discharge their duty having regard to Article 2 of European Convention of Human Rights they were doing so effectively, as a consequence of patient confidentiality, with one arm tied behind their back.

The reason I am writing to you is that I am aware that currently mental health legislation generally is under review and to the extent that this issue insofar as confidentiality as between healthcare professionals from different organisations including healthcare providing companies has not already been raised, then I would like to air the concern via this report. It is my view in relation to other hearings that confidentiality can equally pose a problem insofar as communications between healthcare practitioners on the mental health side and a patient's family. Either of which may have relevant information that would have been of benefit to the other and in respect of which could prevent the loss of life through self-harm and suicide. Whilst the issue of confidentiality should be respected I am concerned that consideration needs to be given to realistic and practical exceptions to that general principle especially if the aim is with a view to safeguarding life. At the end of the day such a matter in terms of reforming mental health legislation is a matter for Parliament but I would like to raise this concern with you following the evidence I heard as part of Heather's inquest final hearing."

Department of Health & Social Care","The death of Louise Cooper on 16/05/20 at her home address was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 17th December 2021.

I determined that the medical cause of Ms. Cooper's death was 1 a Severe Malnourishment

In box 3 of the Record of Inquest I recorded as follows:

Louise Cooper had been diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa for many years. She has received care for this condition during a number of in-patient admissions, the last of which ended in July 2019. Over subsequent months she continued to receive care from an eating disorder service until she was discharged on 2 January 2020. Louise knew that the Clinical Psychologist with whom she had worked for a number of years was due to go on maternity leave. She did not wish to work with any other members of the Eating Disorder Service [EDS] team. When discharged her Body Mass Index [BMI] is estimated to have been at a significantly low level of 12.5. She was discharged on the understanding that she would receive ongoing monitoring from her General Practitioner. The GP surgery was notified about the discharge but due to an administrative issue the need for Louise to be monitored was not appreciated. She did not receive the necessary monitoring. During the weeks preceding Louise's death, her health went into further decline. This was in part contributed to by the Coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 which left her more isolated. Having last exchanged text messages with Louise on the 15th May 2020, a friend attended her home address at approximately 12:30pm on the 16th May 2020 to deliver some shopping as previously arranged. Unable to obtain a reply he forced entry and he found Louise to be deceased on her bed in the rear bedroom. A subsequent post mortem examination confirmed she had died from the consequences of severe malnourishment.

The conclusion of the Coroner was a Narrative Conclusion as follows:

Having been discharged from an eating disorder service on 2nd January 2020, Louise Cooper's condition had not been monitored by medical professionals by the time she died on 16th May 2020 as a result of complications of her previously diagnosed anorexia nervosa.","In addition to the contents of section 3 above, the following is of note:

 Louise was known to have suffered with anorexia nervosa for many years. During the weeks preceding Louise's death, those close to her report a decline in her health.

 It is reported that she stated to friends that the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 Pandemic had removed all of the mechanisms that she had for coping with her condition. A Trust review would later find that as Louise was self-isolating due to Covid - 19, this may have impacted upon her mental and physical wellbeing due to reduced social contacts.

 Louise did not received the monitoring she was expected to receive during 2020. The court found that had she received that monitoring as envisaged, there was a good chance she would not have died when she did, but was unable to say that she would have survived","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

 Louise was known to have suffered with anorexia nervosa for many years and during that time her treatment had included a number of in-patient admissions at times when her extremely low weight became concerning. Neither Louise nor her Father felt that these admissions were in fact helping her to improve.

 Louise had for some time also received treatment from an eating disorder service. Her treatment had included supported eating whereby once per week a professional would sit with her whilst she ate a meal. She responded positively to this. Indeed, it is of note that when her Father attended our court not long after her death, he commented that had Louise been able to have a professional with her once per day whilst she ate, then the outcome for her may have been different and the costs of providing such a service would have been far less than the significant costs of admitting her for periods of treatment in a hospitals. He described her regular hospital admissions as a ""revolving door"" which was not helping her.

 The Consultant Clinical Psychologist responsible for her care at the eating disorder service had tried to commission an increase in the level of supported eating for Louise but unsuccessfully. She told the court Louise needed this support at least once per day.

 There will be many patients such as Louise who appear to make minimal if any improvement in a hospital setting but who may benefit - according to the clinicians treating them - from sustained supported eating. If that option is not available, these patients may be left with no realistic chance of any meaningful improvement."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 17 -27 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide in addition the Jury answered a series of questions raised by me.

In summary, the Jury concluded that Mr Stanley's death was probably caused or contributed to by a failure to follow the processes resulting in the staff best qualified to appreciate Stewart's risk to himself being excluded from the decision to remove him from constant watch. In the addition the Jury concluded that the multi-disciplinary processes in place were adequate however they were not fully complied with in this case.","On 23 June 2020 Mr Stanley was remanded in custody to HMP Exeter.

On the night of 9 to 10 July, Mr Stanley's cellmate found him [REDACTED] seemingly trying to hang himself. He alerted prison staff, who started Prison Service suicide and self-harm prevention procedures (known as ACCT). The staff placed Mr Stanley under constant supervision and moved him to a special cell that allowed an officer to observe him continuously. On 11 July, after a case review it was decided that constant supervision should end and directed that Mr Stanley should now be observed at least once every half an hour during the evening. At around 1.20am on 12 July, the night patrol officer, found Mr Stanley hanging. She called for staff assistance and, when it arrived, they opened the cell, removed the ligature and began chest compressions. Paramedics arrived and took Mr Stanley to hospital, where he died on 14 July.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

(1) The evidence revealed that there was an inconsistent approach taken by staff when conducting and recording observations on prisoners subject to the Prison Service suicide and self-harm prevention procedures (known as ACCT).
(2) The evidence also revealed that some Officers had a different interpretation of the requirements of set out in PSI 64/2011 in respect of the timing of observations.
(3) The evidence also revealed that precise times of such observations were not routinely being recorded accurately.
(4) During the evidence it became apparent that a prison officer worked 23 hours out of 24, he was asked if this was normal and he replied, ""yes, to make the regime work."""

The medical cause of death was E. coli sepsis, resulting from mild renal abnormalities and a urinary tract infection. His death was contributed to by a non-therapeutic circumcision which had been performed a few days days prior. An inquest into his death was opened on 7 January 2015 and heard on 15 May 2015, at which I recorded a narrative conclusion (see attached).","Oliver was born on 9 October 2014. His parents identified a Rabbi who agreed to perform a non-therapeutic circumcision. The Rabbi gave evidence at the inquest that he had been certified to perform the procedure by the 'Initiation Society of Great Britain' (the organisation which supervises the training of Rabbis to perform circumcisions) and that he has performed two to three circumcisions per week over the past 15 years, without any complications to his knowledge. He set out that his sterilisation procedures include the use of an autoclave (to prepare the necessary surgical instruments) and the application of 'Dettol' to the surgical site. The Rabbi noted his consenting procedure comprised discussion of the risk of infection through use of that term only, without further clarification of what infections could develop following the procedure.

I heard evidence that the risk of urinary tract infections is increased after circumcision and that this risk is heightened where the procedure is undertaken in a 'non-medical' setting.

On 2 November Oliver's parents took him to their local Emergency Department because he was feeding less well and his sleep pattern had altered. Analysis of his urine demonstrated the presence of an infection. Despite the institution of intravenous antibiotics and attempts to resuscitate him, he rapidly deteriorated and died later on 2 November 2015.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  	6

(1) The Rabbi who performed Oliver's circumcision gave evidence that his practice was not regulated by any official body or organisation. The pathologist who performed the post mortem was clear that she considered the circumcision to be a surgical procedure. The consultant paediatrician, who was involved in attempts to resuscitate Oliver, stated that research has demonstrated an increased risk of infection after circumcision in a non-medical setting.

It was clear from the evidence adduced at the inquest that the circumcision had contributed to Oliver's death, although it was not possible to conclude that the fact it was performed in a non-medical setting increased the risk of infection in this particular case.

I am concerned that future deaths could occur in similar circumstances, owing to the lack of formal regulation of non-medical providers of circumcision."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 August 2017. I made a narrative determination at inquest, a copy of which I now attach.","Mr Meaney's medical cause of death was:
1a morphine and alcohol toxicity

On Monday, 13 March 2017, he took an overdose and was taken to the emergency unit of the Royal Free Hospital, where he was assessed in the early hours of the following morning, Tuesday, 14 March, by a junior doctor from the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust liaison psychiatry team.

She decided that he needed to be admitted to hospital for inpatient treatment, and he agreed. However, no bed was found for him, and on Wednesday, 15 March, Mr Meaney told the assessing mental health nurse that he would prefer to leave and was discharged.

He went home and the following day he took his own life.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. Mr Meaney waited in the emergency unit for 40 hours and so it was unsurprising that he was then keen to go home.

A mental health nurse from the C&I psychiatry liaison team called the bed manager on the morning of Tuesday, 14 March, and then saw Mr Meaney briefly to explain that no bed was available. The same nurse called the bed manager again the following morning, Wednesday, 15 March, and then saw Mr Meaney once again with no news about admission. It was at that point that Mr Meaney expressed a wish to leave.

There seemed no urgency about the need for a bed for such a seriously ill man.

2. When the mental nurse assessed Mr Meaney before discharge on Wednesday, 15 March, he did not question Mr Meaney's assertion that he had not intended to take an overdose two days before. This was despite the fact that Mr Meaney had told the assessing doctor that he had been trying to kill himself and he had written notes of intent.

3. The mental health nurse assessed Mr Meaney as rational and having good insight, despite the fact that Mr Meaney once again (as he had done repeatedly for many months) raised a physical problem for which no organic cause had been found. In court, the mental health nurse told me that he knew that Mr Meaney's illness was mental rather than physical.

4. The mental health nurse did not consult any other member of the team before clearing Mr Meaney as fit for discharge from a mental health point of view. (The assessing doctor gave evidence that, if Mr Meaney had not agreed to admission to hospital when she saw him, she would have sought an assessment under the Mental Health Act with a view to detaining Mr Meaney for treatment.)

5. The mental health nurse who saw Mr Meaney decided to refer Mr Meaney to his general practitioner for counselling, though Mr Meaney had already said that he had not found the crisis team helpful. Then having made that decision, I heard that there was no evidence that the mental health nurse did go on to make the referral. He told me that all he would do in such a situation would be to send the GP a discharge summary, never with a short accompanying note of request."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 December 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was:

Accident","The deceased died on 30th March 2020 at Southampton General Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton, Hampshire.
The deceased suffered an unwitnessed fall on 29th March 2020 at Southampton General Hospital causing a head injury, at the time of the fall the deceased was mobilising to go the toilet. The deceased's head injury was not identified until 30th March 2020 when the deceased had a computerised tomography scan of the head which showed the presence of a subdural haematoma.","The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows:
When found on the floor the deceased stated that he had a head injury. The Trust has a policy for the assessment and early management of head injuries. The policy was, on the evidence, drafted in 2016. The Trust policy is said to reflect the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance on the assessment and early management of head injuries.
The deceased was receiving the anticoagulant enoxaparine whilst in hospital.
The present Trust policy states that a computerised tomography scan of the head should be undertaken within 8 hours of the injury if a patient is receiving anticoagulant treatment.
The evidence suggested that enoxaparine is a ""low dose anticoagulant"" which did not place the deceased within the Trust policy where a computerised tomography scan should be provided within 8 hours of a head injury.
The Trust were not aware of the September 2019 variation in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance which now advises that patients who are on any anticoagulant should have a computerised tomography scan within 8 hours of a head injury.
The Trust's policy does not presently reflect the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence revised guidance, in place since September 2019.
It was accepted in evidence that the deceased would have had a computerised tomography scan within 8 hours of a head injury if the revised National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance had been applied and reflected in the Trust policy.
The deceased's computerised tomography scan was undertaken 30 hours after the deceased had suffered a head injury."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was road traffic collision.","Mr Andrews was a keen cyclist and had been interested in cycling for about 10 years. On 11 July 2022, he was cycling south along the A4251, Tring Road, where he collided with a stationary heavy good vehicle which had stopped outside commercial premises waiting to unload. Sadly, he suffered significant traumatic injuries from which he did not recover, and he died on 12 July 2022 at St George's Hospital, London.

The inquest received evidence that:
 At the location where the road traffic collision occurred, the road is single carriageway road, with one lane serving each direction. The carriageway is 7 metres wide with each lane measuring approximately 3.1 metres in width with a double solid white line system with a gap between the lines of approximately 0.8 metres. Adjacent to the southbound lane is a grass verge, this gives way to an area of hard standing approximately 0.9 metres in width. A footpath is adjacent to the northbound lane.
 The speed limit at this point is 40mph, there are no parking restrictions and it is not a designated clearway.
 Photographs taken of the scene show that notwithstanding the heavy goods vehicle had stopped as far to the left as possible, the vehicle still took up nearly all of the southbound carriageway which bends to the right at this point.
 Heavy goods vehicles frequently park on the southbound carriageway in order to unload, and witnesses have described this as ""...an accident waiting to happen.""
 Evidence was also received from the Forensic Collision Investigator, who gave evidence that in his view the current ability for heavy goods vehicles to lawfully stop outside the commercial premises to unload represents an ongoing risk.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Mr Derek Weaver (died 31.05.18) case ref: 01562-18 (IF.

This followed a hospital death which there was reason to suspect was related treatment and/or a failure to secure treatment by transfer from the Sussex hospital where he was being treated to the local regional thoracic surgery centre. It took several months to secure medical records and statements from the referring hospital.

The inquest was opened but the original listing was adjourned due to the hospitalization of the key medical witness.

On 3rd October 2019, the inquest was concluded thus:

The medical cause of death was

1a Multi-organ failure
1b Systemic Inflammatory response and sepsis (SIRS)
1 Hypertension and Diabetes

The conclusion was recorded thus:

""Whilst he died from natural causes, his death was contributed to by a 14 day delay in transfer for surgery, which was related to exceptional pressures on bed capacity.""","The circumstances were recorded thus:

""Mr Weaver was admitted to hospital in Sussex with a community acquired pneumonia on 8th May after a 3 week illness. He was found to have an empyema which was drained but it loculated. On 11th it was agreed with the Regional Thoracic Centre, that he needed surgery. His clinical condition improved on antibiotics. He was not transferred until 26th, having emergency surgery on 27th by which time he had become septic again. He had washouts on 27th and 29th which triggered a systemic inflammatory response, from which he died at 08.11 on 31st May.""","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern that in my opinion means that there is still a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. -

A consultant thoracic surgeon who was involved in his care after transfer said that had a higher chance of death because surgery was at a time of SIRS. If he had been transferred earlier he would have had surgery when he was not septic. It would have been two stages, the first being key hole surgery, with mortality of only 1 in 100. That may have obviated the necessity of second stage decortication surgery, with mortality of 5%, but it was probably needed anyway. The delay in transfer related to a surge in referrals, limiting capacity. Most regional referrals of this sort needed to be treated at weekends to maintain treatment of cancer cases in the week. There had been pressure to secure greater resources. The risk of potentially preventable deaths will recur whenever there is such a surge in referrals and be mitigated by provision of more beds."

[REDACTED] Accountable Officer, NHS Hardwick Clinical Commissioning Group ('CCG')","On 7th December 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mia Gibson (age 7 hours). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5th May 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows :

Mia Gibson died on the day of her birth, 16 November 2015, at Queen's Medical Centre, Derby Road, Nottingham. Her mother had an uncomplicated and low risk pregnancy, but suffered a sudden and unexpected placental abruption on 16 November 2015. There was no available ambulance to take her mother to hospital initially, resulting in delay in her delivery. The evidence suggested that delivery anything up to 20 minutes earlier is likely to have avoided Mia's death.

The medical cause of death was :

1a Severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy
1b Placental abruption.","Mia Gibson's mother is [REDACTED] Her father is [REDACTED] had an uneventful and low risk pregnancy. She and her partner had attended all antenatal appointments together. [REDACTED] suffered a placental abruption in the early hours of 16 November 2015. [REDACTED] rang the maternity unit and reported that [REDACTED] had lost a significant amount of fresh red blood. They were advised that [REDACTED] should come in to hospital. They were advised to ring an ambulance for that purpose. They did not have their own transport, but the midwife also felt that would be the fastest and safest way for [REDACTED] to come in.

A call was made by [REDACTED] to East Midlands Ambulance Service at 0229 hrs. It was categorised as Red 2. No double-crewed ambulance ('DCA') was available to attend - the nearest resource was a fast response vehicle ('FRV'), then in Ripley in Derbyshire. It was accepted in evidence that [REDACTED] was highly likely from the outset to require transfer to hospital - indeed that was the purpose of the 999 call.

The FRV paramedic attended, arriving at 0245 hrs. He was told that [REDACTED] had lost ""2 or 3 coffee cups"" of fresh red blood, and he called for Red back up at 0248 hrs.

Again no DCA was available. The evidence was that, of the 10 ambulances operating within a 30 minute radius of the scene, 8 were unavailable as they were attending scenes (eg handing over patients at hospital). The remaining 2 were marked 'NPR' (or no planned rest) - ie they had gone beyond their meal window periods, and were therefore both on compulsory breaks - which can only be disturbed for a cardiac arrest call.

I made clear at the inquest that I am in no way critical of systems requiring crews to take breaks, which I accept are vital for staff wellbeing, safety, and staff retention. The evidence also suggested that many problems regarding availability of crews stem from delayed handovers of patients to hospital staff.

A crew became available at 0300 hrs, and was immediately dispatched to the scene, arriving there at 0312 hrs. They left the scene at 0321 hrs, arrived at hospital at 0332 hrs and handed over to maternity staff at 0344 hrs.

[REDACTED] was reviewed immediately by midwives and doctors and Mia was delivered extremely quickly, at 0404 hrs. She was in a very poor condition from birth, and despite the involvement of neonatal doctors from the time of her birth, she died, with her parents, that day.

Evidence suggested that delivery anything up to 20 minutes earlier would, on the balance of probabilities, have avoided Mia's death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows :

1. It appears that great reliance was placed on the fact that [REDACTED] was not in pain and had normal observations. Little consideration appears to have been given to the 'second patient' (Mia), whose condition could not be monitored by paramedics. We heard evidence that in fact not all placental abruptions cause the mother significant pain, or concerning observations, but for the baby, it can be akin to a cardiac arrest. This factor appears to have been overlooked in the trust's subsequent investigation report, which refers several times to how reassuring [REDACTED] clinical condition was, and was repeated in evidence by the paramedic witnesses. This is a clear training issue, and may well apply nationally.
2. No 'open mic' report was put out to see if other crews could make themselves available to attend this emergency.
3. Dispatchers appear to have allowed a situation to arise whereby the only 2 DCAs not attending other jobs were both on compulsory meal breaks and therefore unavailable at the same time. Whilst meal breaks are vital for staff, planning the timing of these, by ambulance control, is critical for patient safety. Meal break management is already under review by EMAS.
4. It was suggested that obstetric emergencies such as placental abruption could
5. It is clear that resources played a part in these tragic events. No DCA was available to attend this emergency until 30 minutes after the call, and it took a further 12 minutes for a DCA to arrive after that. The time between the 999 call and [REDACTED] being handed over to maternity staff was an hour and 15 minutes. It was clear from the outset that [REDACTED] would require urgent transfer to hospital - a mere 4 miles from her home address - but no resource was available. The evidence of those 'on the ground' clearly showed that this is far from an isolated incident, and I remain concerned that there is a risk of future deaths if this is not addressed."

The investigation concluded on the 7th September 2022 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from complications of a neck of femur fracture from an accidental fall where surgery took place outside the recommended timescales. The medical cause of death was 1a) Bronchopneumonia; 1b) Neck of Femur Fracture (operated on); 1c) Fall; and 2) Dementia,"Ellen Lillian MacFarlane had an accidental fall at her care home. She had to wait for over 5 hours for an ambulance due to demands on the ambulance service. At Tameside General Hospital, it was identified that she had a fractured neck of femur. On 3rd February 2022 she was operated on. Post-operatively she was initially stable but with significantly reduced dietary intake. On 21st February she began to deteriorate and was given antibiotics for a suspected infection. She continued to deteriorate and died at Tameside General Hospital on 12th March 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
1. The inquest heard evidence that notwithstanding her age and frailty Ellen MacFarlane had to wait over 5 hours for an ambulance. This was due to the demands on the North West Ambulance Service on the day in question. The inquest heard that such delays were not unusual and were still occurring. The reason for the delay was a shortage of ambulance crews/vehicles due to a combination of high demand, staffing shortages and delays at ED;

2. Evidence before the inquest indicated that over a weekend Ellen MacFarlane required cardiac tests that could not be provided easily in a District General Hospital setting due to availability of services/staff at DGHs out of hours. As a consequence where an operation for a fractured neck of femur has been put on hold pending further tests there is an inbuilt additional delay over a weekend before a decision can be taken as to the optimum point at which to operate. This situation at DGHs appears to create a situation which is inconsistent with the drive to operate at the earliest possible point when a patient has been optimised to secure the best outcome as set out in the NICE Guidance."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 June 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was narrative.,The deceased SAM MALCOLM TAYLOR suffered mental health issues and had on previous occasions attempted suicide. Paperwork found on the deceased suggested the deceased had recently been admitted into hospital due to a suicide attempt which had left him in a coma for 3 days. Updates on the note stated the deceased would feel suicidal if he returned to the tent he seemed to be staying in. The deceased was found in his tent alone next to the RIVER WYE located by members of the public.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) A prevention duty was owed to the deceased and due to Herefordshire Council communication process failure, contact was not made with him or those with whom he had approved contact prior to his death.

(2) Evidence suggests that in reality Mr Taylor would have met the threshold for vulnerability set out in the Housing Act 1996 but the failure to progress the application resulted in this never being established.

(3) A system for identifying process failure should be in place and effective."

The conclusion of the Inquest was a Narrative Conclusion including the medical cause of death of 1(a) Abdominal Haemorrhage due to (b) Penetrating injury to the Abdomen. I attach a copy of the Jury's findings in respect of their Narrative Conclusion.","On 11th November 2010 Elaine Edith Davison was the front seat passenger in a car driven by her husband. At approximately 8.25pm they were travelling along the A642 Aberford Road, Wakefield, West Yorkshire and were passing the grounds of a disused churchyard called St Peter's, which is the responsibility of Wakefield Council to maintain. It was a stormy night with gusts of wind up to 90 miles an hour. Part of a tree fell onto the car, a part of which penetrated the windscreen, and entered Mrs Davison's abdomen, causing her to sustain fatal injuries, her death being confirmed at 2130 hours on 11th November 2010.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) The subject tree had been examined on several occasions and had been diagnosed as suffering with Phytophthora Pseudomonas, more commonly referred to as bleeding canker. The tree had been given a life expectancy of between nought and ten years. At that time it was not considered to be a danger, but will have ultimately been felled.

(2) Post incident the tree was examined by an expert Arboriculturalist who determined that the tree was severely decayed at 8.5 metres in height with insufficient sound timber at this point to support the weight of the tree. The decay was caused by a fungal infection Polyporus Squamosus. The decay was longstanding and progressive. The decay was hidden from sight, but the tree contained visible defects worthy of closer inspection, which would have led to the discovery of this condition, and a recommendation for it to be felled as a matter of urgency.
(3) I am informed that your view is that the risk of people being killed by falling trees is extremely low, in fact one in ten million, but you recognise the duty of holders who are required to take reasonable steps to minimise the risk. Notwithstanding this I recommend that your organisation as having a major influence nationally on tree safety, bring to the attention of those who are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of trees, particularly in places frequented and used by the public, and for trees that are abut and overhang a highway, when such a tree or trees are recognised as having fault or disease, that such trees are automatically examined and tested for Polyporus Squamosus and if such a disease is identified then the tree should be recommended for felling.
(4) It is apparent that the condition Polyporus Squamosus may well be mistaken for the more common condition Phytophthora Pseudomonas or bleeding canker, and the urgency of felling might not be considered.
(5) It would be helpful if you would bring this case and my recommendations to those organisations that you can influence."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 September 2014.

The conclusion of the inquest was Accident. The medical cause of death was traumatic brain injury.","Jake suffered from autistic spectrum disorder with symptoms suggestive of Asperger's syndrome. This condition led him to establish various lifestyle routines. One such routine was that Jake regularly went off on long walks, often alone.

On the afternoon of 6 January 2014 he went walking alone. He told his family that he was planning to explore a new walking route but he did not say where he would be going.

At approximately 5.45 pm he was seen to run across the Manchester-bound carriageway of the M56 close to marker post 43/9 near Junction 12. He was struck by a lorry. He sustained injuries, including a traumatic brain injury which proved fatal.

Jake had apparently gained access to the M56 via a set of steps near a culvert / bridge support structure below the motorway. The steps were not closed off and were easily accessible.

A representative of the Highways Agency [REDACTED] gave evidence at the inquest. He stated that the original purpose of the steps was to permit access by engineers, not the general public. He added that the steps are now redundant, the engineer access no longer being required.

[REDACTED] went on to say that there is long standing damage / deterioration to parts of the timber fencing along this section of the motorway boundary close to the M56.

[REDACTED] also stated that there are no signs in place warning the public of danger due to the close proximity of the motorway.

I heard evidence from Jake's family that there is a children's playground in reasonably close proximity to the area in question.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) Samples being sent to microbiology in the wrong containers and to elaborate on that Mr Barber had a recently diagnosed aggressive lung cancer on the back of which he developed pericarditis. By the 21st July 2016 it was clear that there was a collection of fluid around his heart which was susceptible to draining. This was done and sampling of the fluid was sent to the microbiologists for analysis. However, it was sent in the wrong container, this meant that it needed incubation before it could be dealt with giving a potential delay for results of between 24 - 48 hours. If it had been sent in the correct pot there is a good chance that full results would have been available the same day it was sent as the laboratory is open and testing until 7 p.m.
(2) Delay in reporting important results to clinicians. On the 22nd July bacterial growth was detected in the bottles and gram staining showed gram positive cocci - this information was passed to the medical team looking after Mr Barber. On the next day, Saturday 23rd July, the laboratory found the sample growing two organisms. This indicated that Mr Barber had a bacterial pericarditis - this was a very unusual situation and the identification of the organisms ought to have been given on the Saturday as soon as it was known to the medical team. For some reason the organisms were not reported until Tuesday 26th July shortly after Mr Barber's death.
Had these results been given appropriately on the 23rd July appropriate steps could have been taken to treat the patient with antibiotics.

It is right to say that in this particular case on the balance of probabilities the two failings mentioned above did not affect the outcome - however it is right to report this so that these mistakes are highlighted and do not occur again either in this Hospital Trust or any other."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7th December 2022. The inquest was heard without a Jury.

Mr. SPRIGGS died of:
1a. Multiple Injuries

The jury returned the following narrative conclusion:

Frimley Park (23rd May - 25th May)

Mr Spriggs was admitted to Frimley Park hospital on the 23 rd May 2021 after attempting to commit suicide by overdosing [REDACTED]. He was assessed as suffering a mental health crisis and placed into a highrisk category. He was kept at Frimley Park Hospital until he was transferred to Farnham Road Hospital.

Farnham Road (25th May - 27th May)

Upon admission to Victoria ward at Farnham Road on the 25th May 2021 at 6:45pm, Mr Spriggs's risk was assessed as low, compared to the assessment of his risk at Frimley Park hospital as high. Upon clerking-in he presented as calm, regretful and rational, presenting as low risk to self with no suicidal ideation at the time. The reduction from a previously assessed level of high risk to low risk made a possible contribution to his death as this may have impacted the urgency of the risk management plan. The assessment did however recommend that 1-1 observations should continue.

During the first night of his stay in Farnham Road Hospital, Mr Spriggs attempted to self-discharge in the early hours of the morning due to high dissatisfaction of the room, isolation and observation regime. Mr Spriggs was persuaded to remain on the ward by staff.",The circumstances of the death are recorded in the Jury’s Narrative Conclusion.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

a. The adequacy of arrangements in place at Farnham Road Hospital to assess and manage inpatients risk.

b. Use (or non-use) of anti-anxiety medication in relation to the support of Mr. SPRIGGS' symptoms.

c. Passage of information between staff concerning patients care and treatment.

d. The adequacy of arrangements to manage and implement the intermittent observation regime at Farnham Road Hospital.

e. Processes for the management of incidents at Farnham Road Hospital such as those on the 27th May 2021 when Mr. SPRIGGS fell from the window of his room.

I received further evidence orally and in writing from the Interested Persons’ subsequent to the completion of the Inquest in relation to these concerns.

This evidence included a response from Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SABP). The Trust outlined a number of prospective measures it is either considering the implementation of, or has plans for their implementation.

These measures included:

1. The Trust was reviewing its risk assessment policy, including a new risk assessment tool.

2. Training and induction packages have been reviewed and revised for staff, including junior doctors and temporary ward staff.

3. A draft Care Planning Principles Policy has been developed.

4. The 10 Key Steps to Safety handover document used by the Trust has been reviewed and revised.

5. The Observation Competency Checklist has been changed following review.

6. The Trust is implementing the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS).

It was explained to the court that these measures should be seen in the context of wider cultural change management being undertaken by the Trust at Farnham Road Hospital.

I have taken account of the measures, many of which are prospective, as outlined by SABP. However, I remain concerned in relation to the matters identified at sub-paragraphs a to d (above).

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

Evidence of the cultural change in the delivery of care and treatment of patients, accepted by the Trust as required, was not provided to the court; either in the form of a plan to bring such change about, or evidence that such change has otherwise occurred.

The adequacy of arrangements in place at Farnham Road Hospital to assess and manage inpatients risk, including the prescription of anti-anxiety medication.

Passage of information between staff concerning patients care and treatment.

The adequacy of arrangements to manage and implement intermittent observation at Farnham Road Hospital."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

(1) In the course of oral evidence Dr [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], both Consultants in Accident and Emergency Medicine at the hospital gave conflicting accounts of how much importance they would ascribe to the lactate level which was nearly twice the upper limit of normal and whether they would repeat it before discharge.

[REDACTED] told me he would not repeat it because he saw lots of patients with elevated lactate and with the resources he had available he would be spending a disproportionate amount of time checking lactate levels in patients who ultimately would be fine. We spent some time on the point and with reference to the NICE Sepsis Risk Stratification Tools. The Guideline is clear that if a lactate is above 2 then the patient should be escalated to high risk. [REDACTED] was challenged several times on his position that irrespective of the guidelines he would not routinely repeat the lactate level dismissing it as an unnecessary burden. He maintained that position.

Dr [REDACTED] took a flatly contrary view and said that she would repeat it irrespective of the burden of work it may generate.

These contrasting opinions indicate a degree of confusion amongst the senior staff at Milton Keynes University Hospital Accident and Emergency Department which in my view poses a threat to patients with sepsis and with elevated lactate levels. The disregarding of the NICE Guidelines simply because it is inconvenient is disturbing."

The weather was dry and bright with clear blue skies.

(1) Although it is accepted that this death was accidental, during the inquest the following information came to light as a result of the investigating police officer giving evidence :

(2) There were a number of errors that were made by the driver which caused or contributed to the death. These were

 Wrongly placing the car in drive instead of reverse

 Failing to look down at the camera and pressing the button to move forward by touch alone

 Failing to realise that the reversing warning sound which was said to be very difficult to hear inside the car was not engaged

 Driving forward and continuing to do so for 8-10 seconds after the accelerator was pressed

 Failing to press the brake at any time.

(3) However, these errors occurred as a result of there being no intermediary step within the Jaguar ipace being necessary to put the car into drive / reverse other than pressing a button. In the police officer’s opinion if there had also been a lever or something similar present in the vehicle that needed to be engaged before a button was pressed this may have alerted [REDACTED] to the fact that he had pushed the incorrect button on the 3 button console."

The inquest into his death concluded before a Jury on 22 July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that Kevin had died by suicide. The Jury further recorded a narrative conclusion capturing a series of failings in his prison and health care, which probably more than minimally contributed to his death from suicide.","On 29 September 2022, Kevin was discovered deceased in his cell, having died as a result of ligature asphyxiation. He had a long history of mental ill health, paranoia and self-harm behaviours. He was placed on an ACCT plan and had identified 29 September 2022 as a trigger date when he might be more susceptible to self-harm and suicide on account of this being the anniversary of a relative's death.

There was a failure by prison staff to perform a planned ACCT review on 28 September 2022 and on 29 September 2022. Staff on the wing were unaware of the trigger date identified in the ACCT because this risk pertinent information was not passed on in handover and the ACCT booklet had been taken off of the wing for quality assurance (so was not accessible to staff).

Landing staff were unaware that Kevin was on an ACCT so did not perform any ACCT checks on the morning of his death.

Kevin had appeared agitated overnight and had not slept at all. This information was not shared with day staff.

There was a failure to provide Kevin with the necessary support for his mental health in terms of therapy, medication review and psychiatric assessment.

Following the death, the ACCT observation and conversation history sheet for 29 September 2022 (which had been blank from the day shift at the time of death) was amended by staff, under the supervision of a senior officer, to record all interactions with Kevin that morning, even though none of those interactions were in fact ACCT checks. This tampering with evidence misled the Prison and Probation Ombudsman's investigation, and only fully came to light during the inquest.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. Prison staff were unfamiliar with the need for ACCT observations and conversations to be meaningful and have purpose. Witnesses repeatedly described these checks as simply ""proof of life"" checks. One witness gave the example of an ACCT observation being completed simply by hearing a noise from within the cell or observing the prisoner collecting his lunch from two landings above. Such cursory observations of prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm is inconsistent with the aims and objectives of the ACCT PSI (64/22011).

2. Prison staff have not read and understood the July 2021 annex to PSI 64/2011. There was a failure to share risk pertinent information about Kevin to all staff caring for him that day.

3. Failure to secure and retain documentary evidence following a death in custody. If post-death investigations are misled by inaccurate documentation that has been amended post-death, then the ability to learn from deaths in custody will be hampered. The preservation of accurate documentary evidence must be of paramount concern when a person dies in custody."

It was resumed on 28 November 2017 and concluded on 30 November 2017.

The medical cause of death was recorded as:

1a. Aspiration Pneumonia
1b. Fractured Left femur
II. Old Pulmonary Emboli, Frailty, Osteoporosis, Hypertensive Heart Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

The inquest concluded with a narrative conclusion, covering the matters set out below.","Mrs Silver was an 85 year old lady who resided at West Hall Care Home in West Byfleet.

On 12-15 November 2015 she was admitted to St Peter’s Hospital where she was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis. As a result, she was prescribed Rivaroxaban, (an anti-coagulant) for life. However, the Discharge Summary contained contradictory information in relation to the prescription, stating both that it should continue for 21 days and then stop and also that it should continue for life. The inconsistency was not noticed either by Mrs Silver’s GP or the staff at her care home, and as a result, the Rivaroxaban was discontinued on 6 December 2015.

Mrs Silver attended St Peter’s Hospital on 1, 12 and 13 January 2016 and on none of those occasions was the lack of Rivaroxaban identified or acted upon by the hospital, despite Mrs Silver telling hospital staff on 12 January 2016 that she thought that she was no longer taking it.

Mrs Silver was then readmitted to St Peter’s Hospital from 26 January 2016 to 4 February 2016, at which point she was diagnosed with extensive bilateral Pulmonary Emboli and restarted on Rivaroxaban. Prior to her discharge on 3 February 2016, her mobility was noted to have decreased and the Occupational Therapist recorded that she would require the use of a commode on her return to the care home. It has not been possible to establish whether or not this information was passed on to the care home.

On her return to the care home Mrs Silver presented with reduced mobility and on both 5 and 6 February 2016 it is recorded that she struggled to bear her own weight on being assisted to the toilet. However, no changes to her care plan were introduced and she was not provided with a commode. Information regarding her recent hospital admission and reduced mobility was not passed on to the carers assisting her on 7 February 2016.

On 7 February 2016 Mrs Silver sustained an assisted fall whilst attempting to transfer from the toilet to her wheelchair, sustaining a fractured left femur. The court found that the fall resulted from her general frailty, which was in part contributed to by the development of the pulmonary emboli.

Following the fall she was readmitted to St Peter’s Hospital. She developed a chest infection on 19 February 2016 and underwent surgery on 22 February 2016. Her condition deteriorated and she died at the hospital on 25 February 2016.","The Discharge Summary contained contradictory information in relation to the future prescription of inpatient medication, which led to the medication being discontinued after 21 days when the intention was that it be taken for life.

The fact that the Rivaroxaban had been discontinued was not identified by clinicians at St Peter’s Hospital, despite Mrs Silver attending the hospital on three occasions since her Rivaroxaban had been discontinued, and despite her informing them on 12 January 2016 that she thought it had been discontinued.

Mrs Silver was not provided with the equipment and support which had been recommend by the Occupational Therapist prior to her discharge on 3 February 2016. It was not possible to establish whether the information had in fact been passed on to the care home.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are:

- Current procedures may result in inaccurate or contradictory information about prescribed medication being included in hospital discharge summaries.
- The procedures in place for recording a patient’s medication on admission to, and discharge from, hospital may fail to identify circumstances in which a patient is no longer in receipt of potentially life-saving medication.
- The procedures in place for discharge planning may fail to ensure that occupational therapists’ recommendations regarding necessary support and equipment are not passed on to those caring for patients in the community.

Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on Twelfth April, 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was a NARRATIVE CONCLUSION.","[REDACTED]
Mrs Webb who was an 86 year old woman had been admitted to hospital on the 26th August, 2016 she was moved between two of the cardiology wards and finally was on Emerald Ward. She had six falls during her time in hospital from admission until the 29th October when she fractured her hip in the sixth fall (the fourth fall on Emerald Ward).
The Record of Inquest in the Narrative Conclusion sets out my anxieties about this lady who fell because she was so mobile.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  -

(1) At the Inquest I was told that on Emerald Ward the Nursing staff have a higher awareness of the risk of falls because so many of their patients are at high risk. However, they provide no specialling. Presumably the rationale for this is that they are extremely good at their job and are able to take care of their patients without specialling. Demonstrably in Mrs Webb's case this did not happen.

(2) There was a plan in mid-September put in place by the Dementia Nurse for Mrs Webb to have increased levels of observation, for her to be engaged in meaningful activity and for allowing her to be mobile but using non slip footwear and a mobility aid.
With regard to the observations I really could not see any evidence that this was giving her enhanced protection. When analysing the falls and their timing it was clear that they always happened early in the morning and often round about the end of the night shift and the start of the day shift when clearly this particular lady was more vulnerable because I suppose she was more active, possibly also if she had been in bed for most of the night she might have been less safely mobile. It's a shame that this pattern was not observed and arrangements put in place to keep a particular eye on her around this period of time.
With regard to meaningful activity it never appeared in the notes following the mid-September plan and since it wasn't in the notes I found no evidence that it happened. I would suggest that on each change of shift the meaningful activity which the patient has engaged in is recorded and noted so that if there is something that he or she finds particularly absorbing this activity can be offered at times of particular vulnerability.
With regard to mobilising, I fully appreciate that the wandering patient who is mobile is at particular risk and I also appreciate the difficulty that might be encountered when trying to persuade such a patient to use a mobility aid. Non slip footwear however, is surely much easier to provide. I know that the hospital footwear comprises 'short socklets' in different sizes (thus the right size is always difficult to obtain) with non-slip soles. I was told that these can shift round on the foot so that the sole perhaps rides round to the top of the foot meaning the socklet then becomes dangerous.
Wouldn't it be an idea to see whether proper slippers can be Sourced. Perhaps there is a local firm who would like to provide these - it would be a challenge to make them reusable or alternatively if they are cheap enough to be disposed of after use by one patient.
Is it worthwhile liaising with South East Coast Ambulance asking them to encourage patients being bought to hospital to bring their own slippers in exactly the same way as they bring their own medications. Whilst I appreciate many of the slippers bought in by patients will be unsuitable by the same token many will be perfectly acceptable.

(3) In the Royal Sussex County Hospital, I understand there is to be or already taking place a trial of 'buzzer alerts' for Nurses - I am sure this is an extremely good idea but feel that it may be more profitable to be proactive rather than reactive.
(4) I was also told that patients being nursed in side rooms and in the balcony area can produce problems for the nursing staff who as I understand it are sometimes short staffed. It may be that when the new building is completed there will be less hidden areas but how many falls will take place between now and 2021 when it is hoped that the building may be open?
(5) The final area which concerns me is handover. It is such an important time for exchange of information so that appropriate care can be given to each individual patient and from what I heard at Mrs Webb's Inquest the handover relies more and more on the notes and the notes are relying more and more on tick boxes which are simply not adequate to deal with the individualities of each patient.
(6) During the course of this Inquest I heard that it was very difficult to obtain extra resources for some of the things which were discussed. I suggested that possibly local appeals could be useful and maybe even an article in the local newspaper engaging the local community in an important Ward given that it deals with many elderly demented patients waiting for discharge to ongoing care within the community.
(7) Discharge itself in the MRFD patient must be speeded up.
These matters which were raised in Mrs Webb's Inquest and which have been raised by me in this Regulation 28 Report are truly intended to be helpful but may mean that some of the thinking around forms and engagement of nurses with patients rather than engagement by nurses with patients' notes must be more prominent."

The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 1st March 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was Accidental Death.,"Mr Bevan passed away on 4/10/16 at Bromford Lane Care Centre, 28 Fairholme Lane, Washwood Heath, Birmingham as a result of a head injury following a fall at the home on 22/9/16. Mr Bevan had been a resident of the Home since June 2014 and was subject to a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguarding Order due to his dementia. His health had deteriorated in the summer of 2016 with a number of falls recorded by the Home. On 22/9/16 he suffered another fall which was witnessed by a staff member at the Home. Paramedics attended the Home promptly and Mr Bevan was admitted to Heartlands Hospital quickly. Following medical assessments it was concluded that no treatment or procedure would be beneficial to him. The decision was taken to return Mr Bevan to Bromford Lane to ensure his remaining days were as comfortable as possible. He passed away shortly afterwards at the Home.

Based on information from the Deceased's treating clinicians the medical cause of death was determined to be:
1(a) SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE
1(b) FALL
1(c) DEMENTIA
2 HYPERTENSION","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

I was satisfied that Mr. Bevan's fall was witnessed by a carer [REDACTED] However, two paramedics who attended in response to the 999 call following the fall both gained the clear understanding that the fall was not witnessed, they described that there were 4 or 5 members of staff present and the scene appears to have been somewhat chaotic. The likely explanation for the paramedics misunderstanding is that a clear hand-over of the history of the incident was not provided by the witness, [REDACTED] but rather the nurses who has responded to the emergency call 'took over'. This was accepted as a potential explanation by the home manager Judy Williams, who informed me that the policy is that the lead nurse should give the incident history to the paramedics: my concern is that if the history is not provided by the witness (regardless of whether they are a carer or a nurse) there is a risk that the correct history will not be given to emergency services which in some cases could have a detrimental effect on treatment."

2. The Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police (Chief Constable Jon Boutcher QPM) as the responsible officer for the joint Armed Policing Unit for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire police forces.","On 22 October 2015, an investigation was commenced into the death of RICHARD THOMAS DAVIES, AGED 41. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest with a jury on 21 July 2017. The medical cause of death was 1a gunshot would to the chest. The narrative conclusion of the jury in answering a questionnaire was:
 Richard Davies died as a result of a single round fired by a police firearms officer;
 Lawful killing;
 Richard Davies acted in a way that was intended by him to get the police to shoot him;
 The jury did not find there to be any errors or omissions in relation to the police communications or negotiation attempts which were possible causes of the death. However, they recorded that they were uncomfortable that telephone negotiations were not considered as although there was only a low possibility it would have affected the outcome, it was worth pursuing.","Following a number of developing personal and health problems, on 21 October 2015 Mr Davies threatened his children with a knife and tied them up in the family home. The police were called. Six Armed Response Vehicle firearms officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Police Armed Policing Unit responded. Upon their attendance at the scene, a number of rounds were fired by Mr Davies from a homemade firearm using live .22"" ammunition. After four shots by Mr Davies, one of the firearms officers fired a single round from his police-issue Heckler & Koch G36 carbine almost simultaneously with a fifth shot fired by Mr Davies. Mr Davies was killed by the police shot.

The bullet which hit and killed Mr Davies fragmented in his body. There was no exit wound. The bullet track went through Mr Davies' left clavicle destroying the medial third of that bone. Fractured bone pieces and/or the fragmented bullet pieces caused significant damage to the subclavian artery which was the most immediately fatal of Mr Davies' multiple injuries.

On the evidence heard at the inquest, and given the significant bullet-strike on bone and bone fragmentation, I determined that there was insufficient evidence (and it would be unduly speculative) to conclude that the unbonded construction of the bullet used by the Armed Policing Unit was a possible cause of this death. Accordingly, I ruled that this issue would not be left to the jury.

Nevertheless, the use by this joint Armed Policing Unit of unbonded ammunition gives rise to the concerns addressed below.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. --

Use of unbonded ammunition by Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Police.
1. The joint Armed Policing Unit (APU) of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire (BCH) Police issued their firearms officers with a type of 5.56mm jacketed soft point ammunition which was unbonded (the lead core of the bullets was not chemically treated to bind it to the bullet jacket). It is likely that this type of ammunition was compliant with (now historic) guidance on police ammunition issued in 1988. However, it was not the ammunition contained in (non-binding) recommendations by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) since December 2005. The Inquest heard that this ammunition had been used by BCH for very many years, was used at the date of Mr Davies' death in October 2015, and continued to be used until last month, June 2017.

The National Position: the use of specified bonded ammunition is recommended but not mandated; no bullet mass retention specification issued
2. In 2005 and again in 2012, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) issued ammunition recommendations to police force firearms leads. For 5.56mm ammunition, the ammunition that was recommended was the Federal 62 grain Tactical Bonded round (2005) to which was added, as an alternative, the Federal 55 grain Tactical Bonded round (2012). These are both bonded jacketed soft point bullets.

3. The selection of this limited number of recommended types of ammunition (both of a bonded construction) from 2005 followed ballistics studies carried out on behalf of the Nordic police forces in 2004. The UK Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) contributed to the Nordic specification and studies because many of the requirements of the Nordic countries were shared by police forces in the UK. The Nordic studies identified that several kinds of ammunition tested were considered to cause unjustifiable and excessive injuries due to their propensity to fragment after impact on test firing into a muscle-tissue simulant.

4. The inquest evidence suggested that the selection by ACPO (on the basis of PSDB advice) of bonded jacketed soft point ammunition following these Nordic studies was due to a combination of two features. First, their favourable operational performance characteristics for police use (including retaining their effectiveness and stopping power when shot through glass). Second, the fact that they did not show the concerning fragmentation risks identified in some other rounds during the Nordic studies. In particular, a PSDB letter to ACPO dated 13 July 2005, having identified the desirability of the Federal 62 grain Tactical Bonded round, stated ""Some of the other rounds tested [in the Nordic Studies] exhibited undesirable characteristics, particularly excessive fragmentation, that might call into question their continued use by some forces"" (emphasis added). The particular unbonded ammunition used by BCH was not tested in the Nordic studies.

5. Correspondence dating back to 2005 shows that ACPO/PSDB were on the brink of issuing a new performance specification for 5.56 mm ammunition in the summer of 2005: ""We are ...nearing completion of trials to evaluate 5.56 ...mm ammunition and publish performance specifications for these calibres for the first time"" (26 May 2005); ""The next stage of the process is to finalise the performance specifications. This will be carried out over the summer, with the intention of having them available by the end [of] September"" (13 July 2005). Such specifications would presumably have drawn heavily on the Nordic specification and studies, including avoiding the risk of unnecessary injuries from excessive bullet fragmentation.

6. For reasons which remained unclear at the inquest, no such performance specification was issued, whether in 2005 or since. Instead, the (non-binding) ACPO recommendation for the use of the Federal 62 grain Tactical Bonded round was issued on 20 December 2005. Thereafter, while ACPO/PSDB recommended the use of this specified bonded ammunition, police forces were not mandated to use them and could instead opt to use alternative ammunition of their own choice.

7. In 2009, the Metropolitan Police Service issued an ammunition specification which did draw on the Nordic specification and studies. It included a scoring system for the percentage of bullet mass retained following impact, which favoured bullets which are less likely to fragment. However, the inquest heard that this specification was not adopted nationally, and indeed Bedfordshire Police were apparently unaware of its existence until this inquest.

8. During the course of this coronial investigation, it was made clear to me that neither the Metropolitan Police nor CAST (the Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology, successor to PSDB) had ever tested the type of unbonded ammunition being used by the APU of BCH Police.

9. In May - June 2012, there was an exchange of emails between the Chief Firearms Instructor of Bedfordshire Police and a Senior Scientific Officer of CAST. The email sought confirmation that the unbonded round being used by BCH was ""still suitable"". I was told in evidence by the Senior Scientific Officer that his reply was not meant to convey any approval for BCH's continued use of the unbonded ammunition. However, it appears that the Chief Firearms Instructor of the APU did not interpret the response in this way. The evidence heard at the inquest suggests that there was a misunderstanding in this exchange and a missed opportunity to consider the appropriateness of the unbonded ammunition being used by the APU of BCH.

10. The Authorised Police Practice on Armed Policing (2013) makes clear that:
 CAST has published guidance in respect of ammunition (an apparent reference to the ACPO recommendations of 2005 and 2012 which was based on PSDB/CAST advice);
 Only ammunition subject to strict factory quality control should be issued for operational purposes;
 ""Where forces choose a calibre or bullet configuration that has not been assessed by CAST to ACPO operational requirement, the ammunition must comply with international conventions and any policy issued by ACPO. In addition forces must be satisfied that the ammunition functions correctly in the weapon issued and that the ballistic performance of the ammunition meets operational requirements."" (emphasis added)

11. The evidence called at the inquest suggested that no policy had in fact been issued by ACPO or CAST to cover ammunition specifications in the event that police forces opted not to adopt the bonded JSP ammunition recommended by ACPO/CAST. Accordingly, the evidence suggested that there was no nationally available policy or specification which would guard against the risk of excessive injury through bullet fragmentation in the event that forces did not adopt the non-binding recommendation to use one of the two bonded 5.56 mm rounds.

12. Specifically, evidence from Bedfordshire police suggested that the Nordic specification had included a requirement that the bullet shall retain at least 93% of its weight when shot with a long reference weapon at 10 m into a 20x20x25 cm block of defined 10% ballistic gelatine. The inquest received no evidence to suggest that this 93% threshold had been adopted as a national requirement for ammunition for police forces in England in Wales despite the Nordic report that several bullet types tested were considered to cause unjustifiable and excessive injuries due to their propensity to fragment.

13. Accordingly, as of today's date, I have received no evidence to suggest that the risk of excessive injury from bullet fragmentation identified in the 2004 Nordic studies has been addressed for police forces in England and Wales other than by a recommendation for the use of two types of bonded 5.56mm ammunition, in circumstances where that recommendation is not binding on police forces. The risk of excessive injury from bullet fragmentation is not addressed in the ammunition section of the Authorised Police Practice on Armed Policing and there appears to be no national specification for 5.56 mm ammunition which police forces can apply if (for whatever reason) they do not adopt the non-binding recommendations to use either the Federal 62 grain Tactical Bonded round or the Federal 55 grain Tactical Bonded round.

The Local Police Force Position

14. The current Deputy Chief Constable responsible for the Armed Policing Unit for Bedfordshire, Cambridge and Hertfordshire police gave evidence to the inquest to seek to explain the reasoning for that unit using the unbonded ammunition rather that the ACPO/CAST recommended bonded ammunition. I also received evidence from the former Chief Firearms Instructor of the Armed Policing Unit.

15. The Deputy Chief Constable recognised that the Force had experienced difficulty in retrieving the audit trail of decisions historically on why these three police forces had chosen particular ammunition.

16. Of concern were the following matters:
(1) A report prepared for the purpose of the inquest and adopted by the Deputy Chief Constable set out the background without any reference at all to the ACPO circular of 2005 which had recommended the Federal 62 grain Tactical Bonded round;
(2) The report sought to maintain that the guidance issued by ACPO in 2012 did not supersede previous lists of ammunition. In fact, the 2005 circular had stated in terms that ""Forces should be aware that these are currently the only two products to meet the new performance specifications"";
(3) The report sought to rely upon a tender process that had been ongoing in 2005 when a different police force leading the tender had corresponded with the Home Office's PSDB. While it is right that at that stage the Home Office advised that the previous (1988) guidance could be followed for this tender, the report from Bedfordshire police failed to acknowledge that the Home Office had cautioned in May 2005 that ""It may be prudent to consider your needs for the next 6-12 months as any changes are likely to be introduced during this period"". The report further omitted to mention that seven months later, in December 2005, ACPO issued the guidance recommending the Federal 62 grain Tactical Bonded round;
(4) The report suggested that minutes of an ACPO meeting dated 24 May 2012 evidences that the police forces and officers present raised concerns regarding the over penetration of the recommended bonded ammunition. The Deputy Chief Constable accepted in evidence that, in fact, based on the relevant minutes, that meeting had appeared only to consider the relative performance of the two bonded ammunition types recommended by ACPO;
(5) BCH police relied upon the fact that in 2012, the ammunition being used by the APU was tested as part of a new tendering process. As part of that testing, the ammunition met a series of technical specifications for ammunition quality. However (in the continuing absence of any ACPO/CAST specification and any standard for bullet mass retention), there was no evidence to suggest that this testing had applied the 93% Nordic standard (or indeed any particular standard) for bullet mass retention;
(6) The exchange of emails with CAST in 2012 appears to have been interpreted by BCH as confirmation that the unbonded ammunition it was using was still suitable. The evidence suggested that this was not CAST's intention. Making allowance for the possible misunderstanding in this exchange of emails, there was nevertheless no evidence available to this inquest to suggest that those responsible for ammunition within the APU of BCH were aware of (or had applied their minds to) the risks of excessive injury through ammunition fragmentation, as identified in the Nordic studies, at any time prior to June 2017 when it arose in the course of this inquest.
(7) The BCH report prepared for this inquest and produced on 9 July 2017 relied on manufacturer's data (indicating a bullet mass retention of 92% at 10 yards) and appeared to suggest that this was close enough to the Nordic standard of 93% at 10 metres to aver that the Nordic standard had been met. At least on the evidence produced to the inquest, this was the first time that consideration had been given to the bullet fragmentation risks of the ammunition being used by the APU of BCH police.

17. Accordingly, I am concerned that the Armed Policing Unit of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire police forces:
 Is or may be treating NPCC (previously ACPO)/CAST ammunition recommendations as not superseding previous recommendations contrary to the wording of those recommendations.
 Does not have in place a system to ensure that if NPCC/CAST recommendations on ammunition are not followed, the ammunition it adopts avoids the risk of excessive / unnecessary injury identified in the Nordic studies.
 Has not retained proper records of decisions made in respect of operational ammunition when it has decided in the past not to follow non-binding national guidance."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 February 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mrs Thompson died from head injuries, namely a fractured base of skull and intracrainial bleeding. I recorded a conclusion of accidental death.","Mrs Thompson, who had been diagnosed with dementia, lived with her son and daughter-in-law. She sustained a right-sided fractured neck of femur and was admitted to George Eliot Hospital, Nuneaton, on 1 November 2015. Prior to her discharge from hospital, a site visit was carried out at her address by an Occupational Therapist to assess whether equipment would be needed to assist with Mrs Thompson's on-going mobility and rehabilitation needs. As a result of this visit, a hoist and a Minuet bed were ordered. Following the delivery and installation of the equipment, Mrs Thompson was discharged from hospital on 20 November 2015.

Due to the size and shape of her room, the bed was positioned along a wall. The bed had four wheels, one on each corner, with a separate locking mechanism for each wheel. The position of the bed against the wall meant that only the two outer wheels could be locked. The two inner wheels (that is, those on the side against the wall) could not be reached once the bed was in position, and so those two wheels were not locked.

During the evening of 29 December 2015, Mrs Thompson's daughter-in-law discovered that Mrs Thompson had fallen between the bed and the wall. The bed had moved from the wall. Mrs Thompson had sustained serious head injuries. She was taken by ambulance to George Eliot Hospital, where she died shortly after admission.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

(1) The bed was able to move from the wall because the two inner wheels were not locked.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12th September 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased died as a result of heroin toxicity, that his death was drug related and that failings of the Trust in relation to among other things, section 117 obligations, contributed to the death.","The deceased had a long history of a dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and drug dependency. Following years of homelessness and imprisonment he was sectioned under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1883 (""the Act"") and received treatment in the Eagleton Ward of the Meadowbrook Unit in Salford. He was discharged from section 3 care with an inadequate discharge plan and the requirements of section 117 of the Act were not met. He was housed in unsuitable emergency accommodation, without adequate support, in circumstances where he had access to drugs and subsequently died as a result of an accidental heroin overdose. The evidence revealed that with proper discharge planning and care his death would probably have been avoided. Staff on the Eagleton Ward had insufficient knowledge in relation to discharge planning and duties, particularly where, as in this case, the discharge was to an area outside Manchester.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 20th of January 2014 and I recorded an narrative conclusion in respect of the death in the following terms :-

On the evening of the 20th of March 2013, Fred Pring began to experience chest pains and at 01.08 the following morning, his wife telephoned 999 and requested help for her husband by way of the attendance of an ambulance at their home address of [REDACTED]

Due to a combination of delays in handing over patients at hospitals and ambulance crews being on rest breaks, there were no resources available to allocate to this call nor to the further two calls made by [REDACTED] at 01.19 and 01.38.

Following a fourth and final call at 01.51 in which [REDACTED] informed the call handler that her husband had died a few minutes earlier, three ambulances reached the property, the first of these arriving some 48 minutes after the initial call. The crew of this ambulance implemented their Recognition of Life Extinct policy verifying his death at his home address on the 21st of March 2013. A post mortem later established that Fred Pring had died from a combination of the natural disease processes of Ischaemic Heart Disease and Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

Although it cannot be established with certainty that Mr Pring would have survived if help had reached him sooner, it is probable that if an ambulance had arrived promptly after the first call, (that is to say within their target response time of eight minutes), he would have lived long enough to be transported to hospital where further medical treatment would have optimized the prospects of his survival.",The Circumstances of the death are as set out in the narrative conclusion appearing in paragraph 3 hereof.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows :-

That the current practices in place for the handover of patients at an Emergency Department far too often results in wholly unacceptable delays with patients being kept waiting for long periods in ambulances and ambulance resources consequently being unavailable for allocation to other calls. Whilst this is a multi-factorial problem, improvements must be made so as to reduce the risk of future deaths."

The cause of death was:

1a Inhalational Burns
b Severe Flame Burns","i) Ms Alam had complex physical health problems which included a reported diagnosis of Ehlers Syndrome and Fibromyalgia. She had previously suffered a stroke and had on-going complications including pain and mobility issues.

ii) She had become increasingly frustrated about her accommodation and her perceived lack of engagement by the agencies involved in her care to find practical solutions to help her with her physical health needs. These included the provision of a ramp. She ultimately decided she would prefer to be in supported accommodation.

iii) On several occasions she had threatened to self-harm and had taken impulsive overdoses. A referral was made to the mental health team and the Consultant Psychiatrist's assessment at this time (12 December 2018) indicated that the patient was not suicidal, not depressed, and not psychotic.

iv) The Consultant Psychiatrist recorded that the patient was projecting responsibility to services, had traits of personality disorder, was angry and abusive.

v) On the 7 January 2019 a further referral was made to the Crisis Home Treatment Team (CHTT) after another overdose attempt. She denied any on-going suicidal ideation and was discharged back to her GP.

vi) On the 25 January the CHTT were contacted by the Social Worker. The patient had attended Russells Hall Hospital via an ambulance after having been found by her carers with her gas cooker left on and a lit cigarette. Her gas supply was disconnected, and she was given an electrical fan heater.

vii) She was visited by the CHTT again and reported fleeting suicidal thoughts due to her physical health problems. She reported no active plans to end her life at the time of the assessment. Her risk of suicide was deemed to be low, however it was noted that this could be escalated due to impulsive behaviours.

viii) On the morning of the 28 January 2019 she had a visit from her Social workers for an assessment. However, this wasn't completed due to a reported hostile reception they received.

ix) She was further visited by housing officers from the local authority and they noted a worrying decline in her mental state and referred her through to their safeguarding department and her GP for a mental health assessment.

x) She was last visited by her carers in the afternoon and seemed to have been in better mood. Later that afternoon, she was discovered in her bedroom and had set fire to her bed and herself. She sustained at least 80% burns to her body and sadly died from her injuries later that day at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

1. Evidence emerged during the inquest that there was inconsistent sharing of documentation and case notes between the agencies involved.

2. There was a lack of a joint Mental Health Trust and social care packages for patients with complex physical health needs or opportunities to convene multi-agency meetings.

3. There was a lack of information gathering prior to the visit to see Ms Alam by the Social workers on the day she died. No contact was made with the Mental Health trust and no assessment took place.

4. The Local authority housing officers did recognise the escalating risk in her mental health state but the mechanism for urgent referral via the safeguarding team and GP was a slow and cumbersome process which didn’t work.

1. All agencies involved may wish to consider reviewing their approaches to sharing of information and approaches to multidisciplinary risk assessments for patients with these complex needs.

2. Social Services may wish to consider reviewing their training for the social workers involved and the importance of obtaining accurate and up to date information prior to any visit.

3. The Mental Health Trust in conjunction with the local authority may wish to consider reviewing their joint agency protocols and developing multi-agency protocols to learn from this tragic incident."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) The evidence at the inquest was that the barrier gate from platform 1 onto the rail lines was clearly marked with warning signs and ""witches hat"" matting. [REDACTED] evidence was that normal practice is also to secure the barriers with a cable tie to deter unauthorised access but to allow reasonable emergency access when required. However, the evidence suggested that at the time of the PFSS visit the gate was tied shut using a shoe lace. This visit was several days after the incident and is not necessarily indicative of the situation on 2 October. However, the evidence at the inquest also suggested that Mr Hinchliffe gained access through the barrier with some ease which might suggest that the barrier was not secured. It is not clear how often the barriers onto the lines are checked to ensure appropriate security is in place.
(2) Mr Hinchliffe was seemingly asleep on the platform for approximately one hour before gaining access onto the line. The evidence was that Blackfriars station is staffed 24 hours. It is not clear whether his presence would have been noted and flagged as a possible security/safety concern."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 March 2025. I made a narrative determination having found that Billie died from infective exacerbation of asthma.","Billie had been brought to the Royal Free Hospital just before midnight the night before her death with an asthma attack.

A first presentation of asthma at the age of 16 years without any family history is unusual, and it was a busy night in the accident and emergency department. Billie was inappropriately discharged at approximately 3.30am without adequate repeat observations or senior clinical review, and so her asthma was not diagnosed or treated.

If it had been, she probably would have survived.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

A PSII (patient safety incident investigation) was conducted and learning identified, but some areas of concern do remain.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. At inquest, I heard repeatedly that on the night Billie attended, the Royal Free emergency department was understaffed, and that it remains understaffed of doctors, nurses, and even a healthcare assistant who could take basic observations.

Billie should have had observations every hour. If she had had these observations, the emergency registrar who discharged her would have recognised that she was not as well as he thought, and would have sought senior medical review. That senior medical review would have changed the course of her management and saved her life.

Following the inquest touching the death of Daniel Klosi, I wrote to you on 16 August 2024 about a lack of observations in the emergency department of the Royal Free. Although the circumstances were different, there is a theme.

2. The registrar who saw Billie the night before her death prescribed an antibiotic, but he was not in the habit of giving the first dose in the department and he did not on this occasion. This meant that Billie’s infection was not tackled as quickly as it could have been. This seems to indicate a training and potentially a guideline need.

3. At the time of Billie’s presentation, the registrar was unaware of the possibility of adult onset asthma. This seems to indicate a training and potentially a guideline need.

4. I heard that Billie was safety netted when she was discharged. Her parents were told to bring her back if they had any concerns.

I have heard this safety netting advice being described many, many times in different inquests. What worries me about it in this context is that Billie’s parents had brought her to hospital because they were concerned. They were then reassured by hospital staff. It is therefore difficult to see how this particular advice could be a meaningful instruction.

In reality, her parents’ initial concern was well placed and they had responded to it appropriately by bringing Billie to hospital. When Billie began to deteriorate again, her parents’ natural instinct had been blunted by their first visit to the hospital.

5. Whilst I doubt that it would have made a difference in this case, I understand that blood pressure is not yet an observation included in the national paediatric early warning score (PEWS)."

Mr Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, City Hall, The Queen's Walk, London SE1 2AA","This report arises from the death of Mr Joseph Agnew, who died on 15th December 2016 aged 63 at Kings College Hospital ([REDACTED]). I opened an inquest into the death on 13th January 2017, which was concluded on 17th November 2020. The delay in hearing the inquest was due to a police homicide investigation, which the CPS decided should not be prosecuted. The delay in writing this report is occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic which created unprecedented pressures on the coroner's service.

The jury recorded the medical cause of death as
1a Bronchopneumonia
1b Hypoxic Cardiac Arrest
1c Alcohol and Diazepam intoxication
It was drug and alcohol related death","This death was an out of hospital cardiac arrest, resuscitated and admitted, but found to have a devastating brain injury, dying five days later. On the evening of 8 December 2016, he refused to get off a bus at its terminus at Peckham bus garage. The bus company called the Metropolitan Police (MPS) to assist with his removal from the bus. Whilst awaiting members of the MPS, a bus driver flagged down a passing police car from City of London Police (CoLP). Two members of the CoLP force attended the incident and removed Mr Agnew from the top deck of the bus, by this time it was 00.40 hours on 9 December 2016. After removal from the bus, they propped Mr Agnew in a nearby bus shelter, and left the scene. Within 30 minutes members of the MPS attended the scene in response to the initial call and found Mr Agnew lying face down in the bus shelter. Their attempts to rouse him were unsuccessful and an ambulance was called.

The jury recorded these matters in the circumstances, but they were not found to be causative of his death:
 Training provided to officers around managing intoxicated individuals with reduced responsiveness was inadequate
 Inadequate checks were carried out in assessing his breathing, airway and primary survey.
 There was a serious failure not to carry out an assessment of his respiratory rate and pulse
 Training was insufficient with regard to action to take when he was intermittently snoring.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN: The attention of different organizations is drawn to each according the evidence and the opportunity to mitigate the risks.

1. For the attention of CoLP and College of Policing:

CoLP officers were not taught how to assess people to meet the agreed criteria for finding someone ""drunk and incapable"". A senior officer was not content that the officers involved had given a satisfactory level of questioning nor welfare checks. The risk to life continues since there appears to be no clarity for officers from their training as to when to refer an intoxicated person for medical attention.

2. For the attention of CoLP, MPS and College of Policing:

No police officers who gave evidence understood the significance of snoring in a person with a reduced level of consciousness, nor how to monitor breathing. My independent expert in A&E gave evidence that snoring indicates partial airway obstruction. He dismissed perceptions of officers that there was such a thing as good or bad snoring. He opined that in a person with reduced consciousness officers should assume that snoring needs medical attention. The person needs assessment to exclude when it is not a concern. Whilst he acknowledged the difficulty of assessing breathing, he stressed its importance as an indication of medical emergency, gave little weight to the value of chest movements which officers used, and highlighted the danger signs of very slow or very fast breathing. He also stressed that concern for medical attention should be triggered by unrousability. The evidence suggested that officers were unaware of all these matters and had not learnt how to effectively monitor breathing.

3. For the attention of the MPS:

Two MPS officers who attended the scene gave evidence that they would do nothing different even in hindsight. No evidence was presented as to the post incident performance reviews and individual learning, and there is uncertainty about the adequacy of the corporate process of learning from incidents. There is a lack of assurance to the public that the risks related to the decisions of these officers or other incidents have been mitigated for the future.

4. For the attention of the Mayor of London:

Evidence was heard that whilst the police can refer chronic rough sleepers to charities, there is no facility to which police can refer acutely intoxicated homeless people found on buses. It was reported that such facilities do exist elsewhere and that they create a place of safe refuge where monitoring can be effectively conducted. The potential of such a facility to save lives is drawn to the attention of the Mayor."

II Cardiac Failure","1) John Day lived alone in a small flat which appeared to be within an assisted living environment with no care on site. He had respiratory issues and was on oxygen for much for the time. He suffered with COPD and heart failure.

4) [REDACTED] did not have access to Mr Day’s medical records. Had he been able to access them, he would have seen that Mr Day was, in fact, allergic to Co-Amoxiclav.

5) Mr Day was found dead in his chair whilst still attached to his oxygen supply, by his friend on 6th April 2014.

6) Mr Day’s post-mortem showed that he had died of natural causes and that the Co-Amoxiclav had not caused an allergic reaction despite his known allergy to this drug.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

(1) During the course of my investigation, I heard live evidence from [REDACTED] who was the out-of-hours doctor who visited Mr Day. He told me that he did not have access to [REDACTED] medical records and that this was a common situation. He said that he had asked Mr Day if he had any allergies to medication, and Mr Day replied that he did not have any such allergies. Whilst Mr Day appeared to have capacity, the information which he gave to [REDACTED] was incorrect, and as a consequence, [REDACTED] prescribed Co-Amoxiclav to Mr Day.

(2) In this case, the patient did not die as a result of the medication which was prescribed, but if the patient had died, an inquest would have inevitably resulted. Moreover, the patient had capacity to give an (incorrect) answer, but if the patient lacked capacity to do so, I am concerned that the out-of-hours doctor has no way of verifying the appropriateness of the medication which he wishes to prescribe. Accordingly I am concerned that there is not a way in which out-of-hours doctors can access the “Allergies” section of a patient’s medical notes in every case. As I understand it, even if a patient opts out of the NHS Spine, the information about allergies should still be available to any medical personnel who consult the database."

The cause of death was:

1a) Acute on Chronic Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage
1b) Bleeding Oesophageal Varices
1c) Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis
2) Low volume Subdural Haemorrhage

The conclusion of the inquest was:

Alcohol-related, contributed to by head injury.","Andrew Lewis was a 55 year old man who died at home on the 7th of May 2024.

He called 111 at 13:42 on 7th of May 2024, reporting weakness in his legs and an earlier fall.

The key times are:

13:42 Called 111, categorised as Category 3 (ie response time within 120 minutes for 90% of calls). This decision required confirmation by a clinician within South Central Ambulance Service ('SCAS'), as the original call was to 111.

15:17 SCAS categorised the call as Category 3. The 120 minute 'clock' began to run at this point. An ambulance should therefore have been in attendance by 17:17.

23:45 Ambulance arrived. Andrew was deceased. This ambulance arrived because family and police had attended the property, broken in and found him unresponsive - the call was then categorised as Category 1 (the most urgent category).

I accepted at inquest that the reason for this chronology was that there was simply no ambulance to send earlier.","During the course of the investigation my enquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

Facts of this case

An ambulance resource arrived around 10 hours from Andrew's first call (to 111 services), and 8 1/2 hours after the ambulance service categorised this as a call requiring attendance within 2 hours.

South Central Ambulance Service generally

The NHS has a framework called OPEL (Operational Pressures Escalation Level), designed to manage capacity at times of excess demand. SCAS' version of this is called REAP (Resource Escalation Action Plan).

The levels are:

REAP level 1 - Steady state.
REAP level 2 - Moderate pressure.
REAP level 3 - Major pressure.
REAP level 4 - Extreme pressure.

There are also categories for critical incidents and major incidents.

I obtained information from South Central Ambulance Service about their escalation levels in the last 2 years. The specific data can be provided, but the headlines (for the period 3rd of August 2022 to 9th of October 2024) are:

 SCAS has been at REAP 3 or above for 90% of this time period. They have been constantly at REAP 4 since 9 October 2024.

 The lowest escalation level that this ambulance service has been at in this period is REAP 2. They have never been at steady state (REAP 1) during this period.

 I have also been provided with data regarding the number of hours that ambulances have spent queuing at hospitals in the last 3 months (September to November 2024). This amounts to 23,253 hours. This is an average of 255.5 hours across the service every single day.

The national picture

1. In the period July 2013 to 24th November 2024, 217 Prevention of Future Deaths Reports ('PFDs') were written to ambulance trusts. It is fair to say that not all of these will relate to delay, but a significant number of them do.
2. There appears to be no oversight of this issue, and a number of ambulance trusts have not responded to these reports at all.
3. I have attached an article published by the Preventable Deaths Tracker in November 2024, which provides further information regarding ambulance PFD reports."

The cause of death was given as- 1a Lobar pneumonia. II Suppurative cystitis, sacral pressure ulcer and aortic stenosis, multiple myeloma, stroke.","The deceased had a history of multiple myeloma, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, stroke and urinary tract infection. She was bed bound. She became resident at New Park Nursing Home, Chilvelstone Grove, Trentham, Stoke on Trent in December 2013. She was on occasions non-compliant with feeding, fluid and turning regimes. She developed a sacral pressure ulcer and tissue viability nurses were involved. Her management plan was not always followed and nursing records were found to be inaccurate. On the 15th October 2014 tissue viability nurses found her pressure mattress not alternating and with the alarm turned off despite twice daily records recording it as having been checked and in order. She died at the home at 8.20pm on the 21st October 2014. The cause of death was given as lobar pneumonia, suppurative cystitis, sacral pressure ulcer, aortic stenosis, multiple myeloma and stroke.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

1. The deceased had in place a management plan for dealing with her pressure sores. The plan was not adequately followed; turns were missed leaving long periods when the deceased remained unturned. Records were not appropriately kept when the deceased declined intervention. Records had been falsified and turns recorded when they had not been done. It was not possible to identify which member of staff had completed the forms. Nursing staff were not available to take calls from the Tissue Viability Nurses.

2. Records were difficult to interpret and did not accurately record times at which fluid and food had been offered to the deceased. The amounts taken by the deceased were not adequately recorded.

3. Staff appeared inadequately trained in record keeping.

4. There was poor continuity of staff.

5. Twice daily pressure mattress checks were fully completed indicating an appropriately functioning mattress. However when a mattress check was made by Tissue Viability Nurses the mattress was not alternating and the fault alarm on the mattress had been turned off. The attention of the staff was drawn to this but it was not subsequently recorded in the deceased's records. The staff were inadequately trained in pressure mattresses management. They apparently checked that the mattress had a power source but did not check that the mattress was functioning correctly.

6. Referral to Tissue Viability nurses should have been done sooner.

7. The deceased had lost a considerable amount of weight but there was no referral to a dietician (although the GP had been consulted regarding her weight loss and had prescribed supplements) The importance of the supplements was not fully appreciated by all of the staff. The deceased's weight was maintained during a hospital stay but deteriorated on her return to New Park Nursing Home

8. The deceased was incontinent and had required cleaning before Tissue Viability Nurses were able to examine her.

9. Single agency staff investigating Adult Protections Referrals had closed their investigation and recorded the allegations as unsubstantiated without obtaining full details of concerns raised by other professionals."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 March 2019.

The medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a. Traumatic Injuries

There was a short form conclusion of road traffic collision.","On the 6th September 2018, the deceased was riding his [REDACTED] Super Duke motorcycle along the B1166 on the eastern side of the junction with the A16 Hulls Drove, Crowland, Lincolnshire. The deceased drove past on the nearside of standing traffic queuing at the junction and onto the southbound carriageway of the A16 into the path of a DAF Tipper Heavy Goods Vehicle travelling on the A16 where the vehicles were to collide. The deceased was knocked into the air and sustained extensive internal injuries. He remained conscious for a period following the impact, before suffering a cardiac arrest. Despite attempts at resuscitation, he was pronounced dead at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  -

1. The court heard evidence from a number of current regular road users describing the layout of the A16/B1166 junction as ""dangerous"", ""horrendous"", ""confusing"" and ""difficult"";

2. In evidence the Lincolnshire Police confirmed that this was the fourth fatality at this junction;

3. The junction was created as a ""staggered"" junction in August 2010. Following one of the previous fatalities at the junction further work had been undertaken with red thermoplastic laid in hatched areas;

4. Expert evidence received from the East Midlands Operational Support Service Serious Collision Investigation Unit confirmed the junction to be an ""accident blackspot"" and that the staggered junction created an on-going risk to future road users in that:

a. This junction should be reconfigured as a roundabout;

b. Alternatively there should be the deployment of considered traffic calming measures (cameras, traffic lights, speed restrictions)."

The medical cause of death was recorded as:

1a) Catastrophic traumatic subdural haemorrhage
1b)
1c)
II) Atrial fibrillation (on warfarin.)

During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard that, following a fall with head injury, an ambulance was called which took nine hours to arrive. [REDACTED], a consultant neurosurgeon at University Hospital Plymouth stated: 'From the information we received at time of referral his level of consciousness deteriorated rapidly from 5: 00 PM, having been alert throughout the day. This suggests that had he reached hospital prior to his deterioration and his warfarin treatment been reversed rapidly, there is a chance that the continued bleeding which ultimately caused his death may have been slowed or stopped, in which case, he may have survived.'

I recorded a Narrative Conclusion that: Mr Morganti died of an accident. The effects of the injuries he suffered were likely to have been exacerbated both by prescribed blood-thinning medication and, more particularly, by a delay in the arrival of an ambulance and his subsequent admission into hospital.

I regret to advise that this is but the latest in a series of inquests conducted in the area where delays in the arrival of an ambulance and/or subsequent admission into Royal Cornwall Hospital have caused or contributed to a death.

On 22/9/22, I concluded an inquest into the death of Mrs Winnie Barnes- Weeks. She died from:
1a] aspiration pneumonia
1b] fractured neck of femur
1c] fall
2] aortic stenosis, ischemic heart disease

Winnie suffered injury on 29/11/21 when she slipped off her bed in her care home while trying to put on her shoes. Subsequently, she was found to have fractured her hip. Winnie lay on the floor for 19 hours awaiting an ambulance that never arrived. Eventually, the Registered Manager of the care home spoke to a local GP who organised a private ambulance. I concluded: 'Winnie died following an accident the effect of which was exacerbated by a long delay in an ambulance taking her to hospital.'

On 18/10/22, I concluded an inquest into the death of Robert George Conybeare who died on 24/3/22 in Royal Cornwall Hospital. His cause of death was:
1A] traumatic intracranial haemorrhage
II] frailty of old age.

On 3/1/22, Mr Conybeare suffered a spontaneous collapse and struck his head. He was taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital where sub arachnoid haemorrhages were identified. By 13/1/22, he was assessed as medically fit for discharge, but suitable discharge arrangements could not be put in place. On 18/2/22, he suffered two falls in hospital and was subsequently found to have a sub-dural haemorrhage. He was transferred to University Hospital Plymouth for burr hole treatment. He was discharged back to Royal Cornwall Hospital on 11 March but deteriorated and died in the hospital on 24/3/22.

I concluded: 'Mr Conybeare died from the effects of a combination of a spontaneous fall on 3/1/22 and an accident in Royal Cornwall Hospital on 17/2/22.'

During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard from a nursing witness at Royal Cornwall Hospital who stated: 'During this time the Trust had a significant number of patients waiting ongoing care in the community. In February 2022, on average we had 36 patients waiting discharge home with care package support, 33 patients waiting for ongoing rehabilitation in a community hospital and 51 patients waiting for care home placement or bedded care assessment.'

On 21/11/22, my colleague, Assistant Coroner Davies, concluded an inquest into the death of Anthony James REEDMAN, who died on 30 June 2021. His medical cause of death was

1a Cerebrovascular Infarct (Complicated by Post Thrombolysis Bleed)

Mr Reedman was 54 at the date of his death, had no relevant medical history, and was described as a fit and active man. He died following a stroke, contributed to by a further complication following the unsuccessful attempt to treat the stroke by way of thrombolysis. The possibility of a successful outcome from the thrombolysis was significantly reduced due to a delay in treatment.

Thrombolysis was administered 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms which is at the extreme edge of the window for that form of treatment. Clinical witnesses stated that with every minute that passes, the prospect of a positive outcome reduces. Furthermore, the risk of bleeding from the thrombolysis increases as time goes on. Mr Reedman suffered further bleeding following thrombolysis. Evidence was heard that the average stroke patient has a 1 in 3 chance of a positive outcome if thrombolysis is given in the first hour after a stroke, that falls to 1 in 25 or 30 at 4.5 hours.

This delay in treatment was a direct consequence of ambulance delay. Triaged by South West Ambulance Service (SWAST) as category 2, the target time for the arrival of the ambulance was 18 minutes. The initial categorisation noted the stroke symptoms and the treatment window. The categorisation was later upgraded for the specific purpose of trying to meet that treatment window. The ambulance arrived 2.5 hours following triage. The court heard that at the time of the triage, the ambulance service had sufficient resources for the level of demand, however, there was no available ambulance to respond because ambulances were detained at RCHT due to the inability to offload patients at the Accident & Emergency Department.","All of the cases listed above have recurring themes, being long delays in ambulance attendance and/or long delays in admission into the only acute hospital in the coroner area, Royal Cornwall Hospital. It is appropriate to record both that these are only a selection of the inquests of this nature already heard and that there are a number of inquests of a similar nature still to be heard.

Owing to the obvious concerns these inquests have generated, I have endeavoured to speak to key stakeholders to understand the reasons behind the recurring delays.

I have spoken on two occasions to [REDACTED], the medical director at South West Ambulance Service Trust [SWAST]. At the time he spoke to me, six of the 10 longest ambulance delays were in the south-west. He told me that the difficulties are NOT due to a shortage of ambulances or to an unanticipated surge in demand. He is confident the region has sufficient ambulance resources and the Trust's modelling is able to predict accurately likely demands on the service.

His difficulty is that the ambulances are in the wrong place at the wrong time. When they are required for emergency responses, they are parked outside Royal Cornwall Hospital with patients in the back for extended periods. On occasions this summer and autumn, there have been queues of over 20 ambulances outside the Emergency Department and delays have been longer than a paramedic's shift.

I have spoken to the hospital's Medical Director, [REDACTED], to try and understand the reasons for these delays. At the time I spoke to him, he told me that he had the equivalent of five wards of patients in the hospital who were medically fit to be discharged but for whom either there was no available intermediate/social care bed or a required care package. This appears to be borne out by the evidence I heard during the inquest into the death of Mr Conybeare.

I have spoken to [REDACTED], the strategic director for care and well-being in Cornwall Council. At the time I spoke to her, she had only been in post for a few weeks. She was, however, able to confirm that one of the Council's main providers of care had closed three homes, being

Trengrouse in Helston;
Mountford in Truro; and
Headlands in Carbis Bay.

This had resulted in the loss of over 110 beds.

The reason she gave for this was that the provider was unable to employ a sufficient workforce to enable the homes to be run at appropriate staffing levels. Indeed, if the three homes in question had not been closed, I understand it would have been inevitable that more of the provider's homes would have needed to have closed.

I understand from [REDACTED] that the council is seeking to re-procure Trengrouse. I do not have a date by which it is hoped this will happen.

I have also spoken to [REDACTED], the Chief Executive of the Integrated Care Board. [REDACTED] was formerly the Chief Executive of Royal Cornwall Hospital. The Board has commissioned research to understand the reasons for the delays that are apparent. I have not seen that research, but I understand the concerns I have identified above are at least part of the findings reached.

[REDACTED] explained to me the plan the Board has for a provider to build three new homes across the county each offering 90 beds. I do not know the likely timescale for the completion of this project, but a best guess may be something in the order of two years.

Lastly, I have spoken to members of the Local Medical Committee who represent GPs' interests in the county. They have brought to my attention the extreme pressures their members are experiencing [I declare an interest in that my wife is a GP.] I understand that the LMC have shared their concerns with local MPs but they await substantive action being taken.","My enquiries and the inquests that have been conducted have revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

- While the successful completion of the ICB's building project will go a long way to improving the capacity of intermediate care beds in the county, it is likely to be many months, if not years, before that additional capacity becomes available. My central concern is how the delays that are currently manifest can be mitigated in the intervening months, particularly given the likely increase in demand for ambulances/hospital admissions during the winter months.

- While there is an obvious need to discharge medically fit patients from Royal Cornwall Hospital, this has to be done in a controlled and manageable fashion. As set out above, GP representatives have drawn to my attention the extreme pressures primary care is currently under. Without more, it would seem to serve little purpose simply to transfer patients from one part of the system that is struggling to cope to a different part of the system that is equally challenged.

- Similarly, it will not benefit patient health to discharge a patient from hospital to a residential home that does not have an appropriate level of staffing. All that will happen is that the patient will inevitably become de-conditioned, their illnesses will worsen and the result will be that they are likely to require re-admission."

Steven Phillip Evans

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on: 26/10/2021 when a jury determined the following:

The conclusion of the inquest was recorded as

Death by Accident

The medical cause of death was:

1a) Polytrauma following a glider crash.","The jury determined the following:

On 27th July 2019, Steven Evans was preparing to fly his glider at South Wales Gliding club. Unfortunately, Steven's failure to secure the tail plane correctly left the glider unsafe to fly. At the point of launch, the tail plane became dislodged, causing the glider to crash to the ground. Steven sustained serious injuries in the impact and despite receiving prompt clinical care, died on 1st August 2019 at the University Hospital of Wales.","During the course of the inquest, evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: -

1. Mandatory radio communication between ground crew and aircraft pilots.

During the course of the inquest the jury heard that problems with Steven's glider were observed before the glider was launched however the system of communication did not alert either the tug plane operator or Steven Evans to the problems prior to his launch. In the circumstances I consider this constituted a failure to adopt an effective communication system at launch, a finding endorsed by the Air Accident Investigation Branch. However, there was insufficient information to determine that this contributed to Steven's death as the glider crashed within seconds of the fault being identified.

In evidence it became clear that the CAA do not mandate the use of radios in the relevant aircraft and by the ground crew and whilst this was previously recommended by the BGA it was not usual practice at South Wales Gliding Club until after Steven's death.

Whilst it was not determined that the failure to have radio communication contributed to Steven's death it appears that radios may still not be in use in other clubs and therefore lives may be put at risk in the future. I consider that further consideration should be given by the CAA to require effective radio communication not only at launch but throughout the glider flight and that the BGA further strengthen the current guidelines that radios are strongly recommended."

3. [REDACTED], President of The Royal College of Emergency Medicine at [REDACTED] FAO Quality Tea","On 19 October 2021 an investigation commenced into the death of Kasey Beech, a 19-year-old woman who died following a cardiac arrest caused in turn by a likely infective exacerbation of her longstanding asthma. Her inquest was concluded on 8 November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that she died by natural causes. Following the inquest further submissions and evidence were sought in relation to the risk of future deaths.","On 5 October 2021 Ms Beech self-presented to the urgent treatment centre at Medway Maritime Hospital (MMH), in light of difficulty breathing. She had also been experiencing chest pain. At MMH the traditional Accident & Emergency service has been replaced by an Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) for walk-in patients. The UTC operates the nationally stipulated STREAMing model (‘Simple Triage Rapid Emergency Assessment Method’), a system whereby patients are assessed on arrival and sent to the appropriate area for further review and care.
Ms Beech was assessed and directed to the Medway on Call Care (MedOCC), where she was informed of a three hour wait. She decided to go to a friend’s home nearby where she could access a nebuliser more promptly. Shortly after arrival there her breathing worsened suddenly, she was unable to inhale deeply from the nebuliser and she arrested. She was subsequently taken by ambulance to MMH, and then transferred to St Thomas' Hospital London. Despite treatment she did not recover and she passed away at St Thomas’ on 13 October 2021.","In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

The focus of the current STREAMing guidance regarding the assessment of new non-injury ambulatory patients able to speak in complete sentences without becoming out of breath is on chest pain. The assessment relates to current chest pain and diagnostic investigations are in turn centred on whether there is a cardiac cause. Such patients who do not present with current chest pain are sent to the MedOCC.
However:
(i) pain can fluctuate over time and may not always be concurrent with the initial assessment;
(ii) pain may be masked by analgesia taken prior to assessment; and
(iii) the focus on a cardiac cause itself risks diverting a clinician from the wider question of identifying the cause of the pain. The consideration of differentials that may be immediately life-threatening, or place the patient at risk of a sudden deterioration (e.g. infective exacerbation of asthma) may be delayed, or not given adequate attention as a consequence.

While it is understood that a cardiac issue is high risk and requires prompt diagnosis, and that the exclusion of a cardiac cause causing current chest pain is also diagnostically helpful, I am concerned that the prioritisation of current cardiac-sounding chest-pain and the streaming to a MedOCC/equivalent service may be to the detriment of other patients who are nonetheless at risk of sudden deterioration and therefore creates a risk of future deaths (in both cardiac and non-cardiac patients).
It is understood that the current national guidelines are under review."

Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care, Mr S Barclay","On 04 October 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Stephen Norman RICHARDSON aged 47. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Stephen Norman Richardson died from the effects of a self-inflicted ligature [REDACTED], however his intention in doing so remains unclear as the evidence presented Stephen had a fear of dying by suicide.","ii. The Jury found,
iii. Self-inflicted ligature on 24th September 2019 at Sid Watkins Unit. Stephen Norman Richardson is a male who was 47 years of age at his time of death. Stephen had suffered with treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia, from the age of 18.
iv. Following a number of medications being unsuccessful in managing Stephen's condition and also a long period of inpatient treatment, Stephen was prescribed clozapine in 2006. Clozapine allowed Stephen to live independently and be able to mostly manage his mental well-being.
v. Stephen was regularly monitored by blood testing and in 2018, he had a number of results which concluded that clozapine could no longer be used to treat Stephen's condition.
vi. The Jury have reached the conclusion that it was reasonable to stop the clozapine at this time. However, the Jury are of the view that there were missed opportunities to treat the neutropenia with a view to restart clozapine and also no exploration of whether other medication that Stephen was prescribed could have been the cause of his neutropenia, rather than clozapine.
vii. Almost immediately following clozapine being stopped Stephen's mental health deteriorated. On the 20th May 2018 there was a marked deterioration in Stephen's mental health. A schedule of daily visits was put in place in recognition of this.
viii. On 24th May 2018 there was a further deterioration in Stephen's mental health. The view at this time was that Stephen met the criteria to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. However, he was not sectioned at this time and the Jury heard that this was due to no bed being available on an acute mental health unit.
ix. Stephen was advised that the plan for him was to be admitted to hospital 2 days later. A plan was put in place for the community crisis team to visit Stephen at his home at least twice a day.
x. On the 26th May 2019 Stephen was still not admitted or sectioned under the Mental Health Act.
xi. Visits from the Mental Health Team had not been completed as previously discussed.
xii. On May 29th Stephen was visited and the conclusion from this visit was that Stephen should be prioritised for admission.
xiii. Later on that day Stephen attempted to hang himself.
xiv. The Jury are of the conclusion that the failure to secure a bed on an acute Mental Health Unit for Stephen was a gross failure that contributed to the attempted hanging. Furthermore, this failure also contributed to Stephen sustaining a hypoxic brain injury, and the damage he sustained to his throat, which resulted in Stephen needing to be peg fed.
xv. Whilst as an inpatient at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, Stephen's behaviour became cause for concern, this resulted in the plan for Stephen being that he would be admitted to Clock View rather than the Brain Injury Unit, A bed was found on 28th June 2019. Stephen became an inpatient at Clock View 2nd July 2019.
xvi. Stephen was viewed as having a settled period at Clock View.
xvii. On 11th July 2019 Stephen was transferred to the Brain Injury Unit, this was described as an emergency transfer due to the need for his bed to be used by another patient.
xviii. The Jury are in agreement with Stephen's family in that this transfer was not in Stephen's best interest, as there had been no plan of care established for Stephen at the time of transfer. Whilst being an inpatient at the Brain Injury Unit, there were incidents of Stephen assaulting staff. Due to these incidents Stephen was returned to Clock View on 24th July 2019.
xix. On 14th August 2019 [REDACTED] was found outside Stephen's room, when asked about the [REDACTED], Stephen said that it fell out of his pants.
xx. Following this incident a written record was made and the information was verbally shared at the start of the handover. However there was no alteration to Stephen's risk assessment.
xxi. In addition to this there was no safeguarding plan implemented to reflect the incident and any possible related risks.
xxii. The jury have noted that, prior to the cord being found Stephen had requested to call his mother. Following Stephen being unable to contact his mother the cord was found.
xxiii. The jury have concluded that non-completion of the risk assessment document was in itself a significant failure. On discussion of a transfer back to the Brain Injury Unit family shared concerns as to the ligature risks, and the loss of protective factors such as familiarity with his surroundings and staff.
xxiv. At the unit family were also in disagreement with a transfer to the Brain Injury Unit at this stage due to their views that the physical environment at the unit being a risk to Stephen.
xxv. Following an assessment of Stephen a phased transfer plan was proposed.
xxvi. The Jury have concluded that this was a significant failure in that this plan was not communicated to relevant persons.
xxvii. In addition to this the Jury conclude that in the one instance that the plan was shared it was misunderstood by bed management. This is viewed by the jury as a missed opportunity for Stephen.
xxviii. Despite the proposed phased return to the Brain Injury Unit and the concerns raised by the family Stephen was transferred with immediate effect on the 16th September 2019. Between 7th September 2019 and the 25th September 2019, no risk assessment was completed either by Clock View or the Brain Injury Unit.
xxix. The Jury concluded that this was a serious missed opportunity as there was an absence of documentation to inform care planning and safeguarding steps for Stephen.
xxx. Documentation that was completed for Stephen prior to 24th September 2019 recorded occasions of Stephen having suicidal thoughts.
xxxi. It is also documented that Stephen had a recognition of his thoughts at this time and requested support in an effect to keep himself safe.
xxxii. On the day of the ligature incident (24th September) observations from ward staff state that he was settled, watched TV, spent time in his room, showered, went shopping and wash and dried his clothes. Stephen's sister also visited him that evening.
xxxiii. Following the staff handover on the ward, Stephen's observations show that there was a change in Stephen's presentation. He is noted as refusing his medication, refusing access to his room and throwing an item around his room. Stephen is also recorded in observations as being anxious. The Jury heard in evidence that there was no qualified mental health nurse on shift working that evening.
xxxiv. Stephen's behaviour continued and a decision was made to allow him to have time to calm down. At 23:20 Stephen spoke to staff to request that he could make a telephone call to his mother. Stephen was bare chested and he was asked to put a top on but refused to do this.
xxxv. At 23:40 Stephen repeated his request to call his mother again. He was told that he could use the phone in the office, but refused and said that he had changed his mind, saying it did not matter.
xxxvi. A short time later staff noticed that Stephen's room was in darkness. A light on a mobile phone was shone into the room. This was in an attempt to see where Stephen was in the room. The door of Stephen's room was found to be barricaded and the jury heard in evidence that it took 4 - 6 minutes to clear the barricade and enter the room.
xxxvii. Evidence was also given that no noise was heard at any time of Stephen barricading his bedroom door. On entering the bedroom, Stephen was found ligatured behind the bathroom door.
xxxviii. It has been discussed in court that the procedure to be followed at the Brain Injury Unit in such circumstances is to call 2222 and 999 to alert emergency services. Although staff called 999 at 23:53 no call was made to 2222. The Jury have concluded that there were missed opportunities due to there being no knowledge of the correct procedures to follow.
xxxix. However it is acknowledged that this failure would not have altered the outcome for Stephen. The Jury also conclude that lack of communication between persons on duty was a failure to respond appropriately to Stephen's behaviours.
xl. For example, there was no information shared as to the [REDACTED] being found 4 weeks earlier. The sharing of the incident could have allowed for additional risk planning.
xli. As a jury we would like to offer Stephen's family our sincere condolences.
xlii. Stephen was transferred to ICU at University Hospital Aintree on the 24th September 2019 and sadly passed on 28th September 2019. As a result of his extensive brain damage the decision was made by his family to withdraw his life support. Stephen was pronounced dead.”","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

It was clear from the investigation that at the time of Stephen ligaturing in May 2019 there was an national shortage of acute pyschiatric beds to treat patients in the community suffering with mental disorder of a nature or degree which necessitated immediate assessment treatment and care as an inpatient. The evidence heard has confirmed that that parlous situation has not improved."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

The National Ambulance Call Categories prescribed by NHS Pathways to ambulance services, including South Central Ambulance Service, who were the attending service in relation to Alf Rewin's death, indicate that an individual contacting emergency services himself or herself, having taken an overdose may be triaged through the national call handling pathway to a Category 3 Urgent Call. This category currently prescribes a target attendance within 120 minutes.
There is a concern that in cases of overdose, the patient is at risk of becoming unconscious or having a cardiac arrest or other potentially fatal event and will be unable to contact emergency services or be contacted by them subsequently, such that his or her call should at that stage then be regarded as Category 1 (with a 7 minute response time) or Category 2 (with an 18 minute response time).
In Alf Rewin's case, there existed a local policy to override the Category 3 120-minute response in overdose cases to provide a specific triage which could lead to a Category 2 18-minute response (although the 18-minute response was not, in fact, implemented at the outset in Alf Rewin's case and he was initially allocated the national Category 3 response).
It is understood that the national categorisation of overdose cases is under review.
Whilst the Category 3 120-minute target may be the standard, subject to local variation, in relation to overdose cases where the patient is conscious, the risk of deaths arising during this period remains where the circumstances of the overdose might enable some counteractive treatment to be given, or successful resuscitation measures to be carried out, if there were to be earlier attendance and / or earlier hospitalisation."

3. Brompton NHS Trust","An investigation into the death of Mr Harold Chapman, aged 34, was opened following Mr Chapman's death on 14 June 2016. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 October 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion which covered, in summary, the following:

Mr Chapman had been diagnosed with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 2009, and referred to a specialist team in 2010. His reviews and treatment from early 2010 to May 2015 were unremarkable and his risk stratification was low.

In August 2015, he developed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) present in 2 holter readings (August and December 2015). The consultant requesting the August trace did not review it. It was reviewed by a clinical fellow in November 2015 who considered it to be unequivocal. Subsequent review in 2016 confirmed the presence of NSVT and a significant increase to Mr Chapman's risk factors for an episode of a more significant arrhythmia and subsequent sudden cardiac death.

A further holter trace in December 2015 also revealed NSVT; this was not reviewed until it was seen by a new team in April 2016. Following the review in April 2016, he was referred for consideration of an ICD implant which would deliver a shock should he develop sudden arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). The chances of survival of an out of hospital cardiac arrest were low. His risk stratification in April 2016 was 8.7% and warranted consideration of the implant.

I considered Mr Chapman died as a result of natural causes but that the care provided to him in/around August and November 2015 was such that it amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care for his condition and his risk stratification and the subsequent insertion of an ICD to treat and prevent a sudden cardiac death incident.","Mr Chapman had been diagnosed with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 2009, and referred to a specialist team in 2010. His reviews and treatment from early 2010 to May 2015 were unremarkable and his risk stratification was low.

The Trust were aware of Mr Chapman's condition and its possible complication having been central to the development and implementation of the ESC Guidelines in 2014 on the management and treatment of individuals with HCM. The development of NSVTs increases an individual's risk stratification and the percentage chance of having a sudden cardiac death arrhythmia. Such an arrhythmia can only be treated by way of delivery of an electrical shock. If a shock is not delivered within minutes the chances of survival are low. The ICD delivers that shock.

The waiting time for an ICD insertion, having passed through the various reviews and assessments around the time of Mr Chapman's death was 6 months. Following the holter trace in August 2015, this was not reviewed by the consultant; it showed a run of NSVT. He was reviewed in the clinic in November 2015, it was deemed unequivocal. No action was taken and the failure had a direct and clear causal connection with Mr Chapman's death. Statistically there was no way of knowing if and when Mr Chapman might have had a significant arrhythmia. At the time of his death he had opted for and was on the waiting list for assessment of an ICD following review of the same August trace. In all the circumstances the missed opportunity more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Mr Chapman's death. Rendering that treatment, at the earlier time would, on balance, have saved Mr Chapman's life when he had the arrhythmia in June 2016.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed during his dealings with the Barts NHS Trust and, more specifically the lead consultants, emails were passed by Mr Chapman to the consultants. It became clear during the inquest that those emails were often not viewed and/or acted upon and as a result no response was received by the patient.

It is fully appreciated that consultants are busy with their clinical responsibilities covering wards, clinics and on-calls.

However, if contact details are provided for 'direct access' to individual doctors/consultants, it seems obligatory that those should be viewed, acknowledged and patients responded to.

Patient contact with medical professionals, not just hospital related, is an important part of modern medical practice.

Whilst this is a huge task, it would seem possible to come up with either National or local guidelines in respect of the use of all forms of communication between patients and their clinician (covering phone and emails)."

The President, The British Association of Dermatologists 6. The President, The Royal College of Psychiatrists",In April 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Deidre Harvey. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest where I sat with a jury between 16th and 27th July 2017. The medical cause of death was: 1.a Hanging. The jury returned a conclusion as follows: Accident contributed to by neglect.,"Deidre Harvey had had a long history of bipolar disorder, having first undergone treatment in the 1990s. She had a long period of stability in the community between 2006 and 2016 but on October 13th 2016 her condition worsened and she was admitted to the Mental Health Unit, Royal Glamorgan Hospital. From admissions she was transferred to Ward 22 on 1st November 2016. She was discharged on 21st November 2016 but took an overdose on 24th November and a serious suicide attempt on 8th December. She was again admitted to the admissions ward after two days 1 HDU, and then on 4th January 2017 was transferred to Ward 22 again. She remained on that ward until her death on 10th April 2017. She was made subject to a Section 3 Mental Health Act order on 21st February 2017 and this was continued until her death. Deidre suffered from several concomitant physical condition including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus for which she was prescribed the drug Hydroxychloroquine. This had been administer34ed to her at 200 mg per day from mid-November 2016 until her death. At the time of her death blood analysis showed that she had accumulated toxic levels of this drug in her system (more than 15 mg/DL which is above the level at which cardiac arrhythmias have been noted (3.6 mg/L) and death (7.5 mg/DL). In the event however the pathologist did not attribute Deidre's death to Hydroxychloroquine toxicity.

Deidre's mood from January to April was fluctuating. The team on Ward 22 also struggled to get her hyponatraemia under control and this compromised both the individual mood stabilisers and anti-depressants they were able to give, as well as the quantity at which they were able to give them. The team said they planned to give ECT but this had not been administered by the 10th April 2017. While the Hydroxychloroquine continued to be administered there was no dialogue between the mental health ward and the consultants treating her other conditions (dermatology and gynaecology). In February 2017 Deidre cut her wrists (13/2) and on the 20th February 2017 she made a disclosure to a nurse that she had attempted to hang herself with a dressing gown cord. She was placed on a Section 3 Mental Health Act order on the 21st February. In March Deidre and her daughter both reported that she was putting on a front, or putting on a mask. Her mood fluctuated but she made comments that she wanted to end it. On 10th April 2017 she appea4rd to be brighter and looking forward to going home. She went to the communal bathroom on the ward and told staff that she was having a shower at 8.40 am. At 8.55 am staff went into the bathroom and found that Deidre had died after attaching a ligature to her neck. The ligature used was a dressing gown cord which had previously been removed from her after a threat she made to hang herself with it. The cause of death was given by the pathologist as 1a Hanging.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

Secretary of State for Health

1. The inquest heard that patients on Mental Health Units often have significant physical problems which are treated by outside consultants, who may have little input into their care on the ward or may not even know they are there. In this inquest the consultant psychiatrist treating Deidre was not aware of the potentially toxic effects of the drug for her lupus.

The Coroner is concerned that outside consultants should have a more active input into the care of the mental health patient on a Mental Health Unit, in order that their expertise and knowledge is available to the treating consultant psychiatrist.

2. The inquest heard that an obvious ligature point was identified in September 2016 in the Mental Health Unit, and yet bureaucratic processes meant that approval for funding the rectification of this ligature point was held up for months, with staff having to ""manage"" the risk.

The Coroner is concerned that there should be an expedited process for rectifying obvious ligature points on Mental Health Units

3. The inquest heard that there was confusion between staff on the Mental Health Unit and the Community Psychiatric Nurse over management of risk for a patient admitted on the Mental Health Unit, with the result that responsibility for a Risk assessment might not be recognised.

The Coroner is concerned that there should be proper management and dissemination of risk management policies to frontline staff to avoid any confusion

Hydroxychloroquine
1. The expert evidence given was that Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is not contra-indicated in Appendix 1 of the BNF for anti-epileptic drugs. The manufacturer's leaflet however does contain a caution against using HCQ alongside anti-epileptic drugs. It is acknowledged that the text of the BNF does indicate that HCQ should not be used in case of neurological disorders (including epilepsy) but this does not catch patients like Dee who was on an anti-epileptic drug (Lamotrigine) for her bipolar condition but was not epileptic.

The coroner is concerned that the BNF might not fully describe the risk to patients taking Lamotrigine (or drugs of similar class or composition) alongside Hydroxychloroquine.

Royal College of Psychiatrists

Hydroxychloroquine
1. The evidence in the inquest showed that the psychiatrists treating Deidre were largely unware of the potential side-effects of Hydroxychloroquine which Deidre was received for her Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. These include mental changes and psychosis.

The Coroner is concerned that consultants treating other mental patients who are receiving this drug should be aware of these side-effects, and is concerned that there should be proper liaison with the consultant dermatologist over its toxic and potential metal health side-effects.

In General the Coroner is concerned that the psychiatrists treating a patient in a Mental Health Unit should have the benefit of specialist advice from outside consultants who may be treating the patient for a physical condition

British Association of Dermatologists

Hydroxychloroquine
1. The expert evidence received in this inquest revealed that Hydroxychloroquine could build up to toxic levels even with normal dosage[REDACTED] of the Dept of Toxicology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital reported that there is a clear cross-over between apparently toxic concentrations and apparently therapeutic concentrations. Dee at the time of her death had a concentration of approximately 25 mg/L and fatalities at 7.5 mg/L.
The Coroner is concerned that this drug should not be prescribed to a patient suffering from Lupus (which in itself is not life-threatening) without an awareness that toxic levels can build up even at the recommended dose.

The Coroner is concerned that the dermatologist prescribing this drug should liaise with other consultants treating the patient for other conditions (in Deidre's case for her mental health problems) so that specialist knowledge about the toxic effects of this drug can be shared.

CEO Alerts NHS
Hydroxychloroquine
1. The evidence in this inquest is that Deidre (who was a detained patient under Section 3 MHA) was being given a drug for a physical condition (Lupus) which can build up to toxic levels even at normal doses. The inquest heard that there is no routine checking of Hydroxychloroquine levels at clinical level, even though[REDACTED] said he thought that clinical monitoring of this drug might be important.

The Coroner is concerned that there may be other dependent persons suffering from lupus (or other conditions for which Hydroxychloroquine is prescribed in NHS hospitals in England and Wales) who may also have toxic levels of Hydroxychloroquine in their system unbeknown to their carers."

‘Christopher Smith died at Medway Maritime Hospital on 4th March 2019 of pneumonia with abscesses due to cellulitis with ulceration caused by peripheral vascular disease. He had two admissions to hospital in January and February and treated for sepsis and hyponatremia. He was discharged home alone on 10th February with intractable leg ulcers with no home assessment and no district nurse referral. This, and a lack of adequate nourishment caused an exacerbation of his leg ulcers that probably accelerated his death.’","Christopher Smith was admitted into hospital on 21st January 2019 with a history of peripheral vascular disease, extensive leg ulcers and epilepsy and was diagnosed with cellulitis and later with a chest infection. He was found not to have capacity for his treatment and a deprivation of liberty authorisation was sought.
He remained on a discharge ward from 2nd February until 10th February during which time he suffered deterioration, nursing documentation was that he remained confused and his capacity for decisions around his care and treatment was not reassessed. Mr Smith was discharged without appropriate discharge planning or district nurse referral and his leg ulcers were not treated or dressed. Transport staff had significant concerns that his home was not safe or fit for habitation and raised a safeguarding alert when the hospital stated there was no bed for him. His family were not informed and found him five days later on the floor unable to move and with no dressings on his legs.
He was readmitted to hospital on 15th February with sepsis, confusion and self-neglect and received treatment. There was a delay seeking the advice of a dietician and the advice was not followed. Mr Smith’s assessed nutritional needs were not met. He continued to deteriorate and died on 4th March 2019.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

Evidence was heard that:

(1) A recommended home assessment was not completed as part of Mr Smith’s planned discharge from hospital.

(2) The next of kin was incorrectly recorded on Mr Smith’s medical records and the family were not informed of his discharge home as part of the discharge planning that he required care.

(3) Mr Smith remained on a discharge ward from 2nd February until his discharge on 10th February even though he suffered a deterioration in his medical condition. Mr Smith’s capacity fluctuated during his admission, he was noted by nurses to be confused and his capacity was not reassessed.

(4) Nursing notes in respect of Mr Smith’s discharge were incomplete, incorrect, and led to assumptions being made that Mr Smith

a. had capacity to make decisions about his care and treatment

b. was being cared for in the community.

(5) Mr Smith has extensive leg ulcers that required specialist input. No district nurse referral was made to ensure that Mr Smith’s leg ulcers were treated.

(6) Transport staff returning Mr Smith home found he had no key. One was located and on entering the property found conditions that caused them serious concern about the hygiene and health and safety within the property with a leak, uncleanliness and exposed electrical wiring and that there was no bed.

(7) Transport staff were informed by the hospital not to return Mr Smith to the hospital as there was no bed available and they therefore raised a safeguarding alert. The safeguarding alert was not acted upon and Mr Smith was found by family after five days lying on the floor of his home with no dressing on his legs, unable to move and with no access to food or drink.

(8) On readmission to hospital his dietary requirements were not adequate for his needs."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

Multiple witnesses indicated that the Risk Assessment Tool on the online system (EPJS) is not used in line with policy (i.e. that a new assessment in that tool is undertaken at the time of each admission/discharge/major risk event etc.), and, if updated, may only be updated in so far as additional narrative is added to the last such narrative in a previously completed assessment. Further, the evidence was that rather than be used for a detailed assessment per the indicators set out in the tool at the time of each relevant event, it was reviewed to instead access any past assessment in order (only) to establish quickly a benchmark against which the gauge a patient’s current presentation when considering their risks. The detailed indicators informing the risk assessment were not updated.

Although it was submitted that patient risk was nonetheless assessed and recorded in the EPJS, and acknowledged that benchmarking/comparison is useful, I am concerned that: (1) if the risk indicators set out in the tool are not systematically reviewed or reconsidered, then the assessment of risk that follows will then be based on incomplete, and therefore misleading, information; and (2) absent the above, and dating of revisions within a compound document, it is not clear on what indicators any assessment is in fact based (3) to the extent the risk assessment is used as a benchmarking tool, the impression given to the most recent viewer is then likely to be incomplete and misleading; (4) the apparent current use of the tool to establish a point of benchmarking/comparison is in any event lost where the compound narrative assessments are not clearly dated and signposted ; (5) if the detailed patient assessment is instead placed as a new entry in the general chronological notes, the usefulness of the tool as a clear, well signposted, dated assessment and documentation of the patients of risk(s), is lost, requiring a reviewer to instead review the general chronological log of entries on the EPJS where it is not required to be articulated in the same terms, and may be more difficult to identify in a longstanding patient."

Jenson James Francis was delivered by caesarean section on 21st June 2019. He developed chorioamnionitis and funisitis as a result of maternal sepsis. While the presence of maternal sepsis affecting his mother, [REDACTED] had been identified, there were failures on the part of the clinical care to identify that the CTG was abnormal or pathological from about 22.16 on 20th June 2018 or to arrange for urgent delivery by caesarean section. Thereafter, there was an absence of review by an obstetric doctor from 01.45 - 04.00 on 21st June 2018, when the sole available doctor was detained in theatre, and an absence of a jump call. Had [REDACTED] proceeded to caesarean section it is likely that Jenson James Francis would have been less exposed to maternal sepsis and survived.

The narrative conclusion which I returned was:

Jenson James Francis died of Cardio pulmonary failure as a result of a failure to deliver him in good time, exposing him to the effects of developing maternal sepsis

The Inquest focused upon:-

a. The failure of the obstetric and midwife staff properly to classify the CTG trace as abnormal, including deficiencies in their training
b. A lack of medical cover on the labour ward while the only available doctor was detained in theatre
c. Unclear leadership structure within the clinical team.
d.

(1) The root cause analysis characterises the presence of a ""dysfunctional team without a clear leader."" Evidence at the Inquest and in the report of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists dated 16th April 2019 identified a culture of unclear clinical leadership and a perceived inability on the part of more junior staff to challenge or review decisions.
(2) There was a poor standard of CTG interpretation, with insufficient training and review
(3) There was unclear communication as to whether a category 1 or 2 caesarean section was required.
(4) NEWS charts and partograms were not completed, and there was a poor standard of record keeping.
(5) There were insufficient staffing levels, and very high acuity, despite which there was no consultant attendance and the escalation policy was not used. There was evidence that there was no clear line of responsibility for identifying this and ameliorating it.
(6) The recent merger of the maternity units of the Prince Charles and the Royal Glamorgan hospitals, while potentially creating a future single centre of expertise, does risk causing a period of institutional stress to maternity services which have exhibited some significant shortcomings."

Mr Woods had contacted the Target Sports Centre (""the shooting range"") on 8th October 2019, asking to arrange a tour of the site with a view to arranging a day out for his work colleagues. When he attended that afternoon, he requested availability of a ""shooting experience"" and was told there was availability on the 25 metre range for one hour of shooting, supervised by a qualified range officer. Mr Woods agreed, underwent a safety briefing and then proceeded to the 25 metre range together with one other participant and the range officer.

Mr Woods' death was investigated by the police and the Dorset Council Environmental Health Department. Four recommendations were made to the shooting range by [REDACTED], the Environmental Health Officer investigating the death. All recommendations have been adopted by the shooting range.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 25 April 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision, the medical cause of death was multiple injuries","1. On the evening of the 8 November 2015 Harold James Davies was driving his Volvo motorcar along Station Road, Collingham, Nottinghamshire towards its junction with the A.46 dual carriageway.
2. From the surrounding evidence, it is likely that Mr Davies was intending to cross onto the northbound carriageway of the A.46 and turn right into the southbound carriageway towards Newark.
3. Mr Davies did not stop at the junction or give way to oncoming traffic in the northbound carriageway, and collided with a Jaguar motorcar travelling in lane 2.
4. Subsequent investigation of the vehicles involved in the collision and of the collision scene itself concluded:
(a) There were no mechanical or electrical defects in either vehicle that would have caused or contributed to the collision
(b) Neither driver were under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants
(c) The weather conditions were reasonable
(d) Both lighting an visibility were goo
(e) The carriageways were free of any defects or contaminants that might have caused or contributed to the collision
(f) The warning signs on the approach to the junction were clear and unobstructed.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

THE MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. Although the current road layout and existing safety provisions did not cause or contribute to the particular circumstances of this collision, I am concerned that this is the 3rd fatality at this junction since 2010. The 2 most recent fatalities in January 2014 and November 2015 involving, vehicles emerging from Station Road into the northbound carriageway.

2. Highways England and their maintenance contractor A-One+ have undertaken an extensive risk assessment of the junction and there is a proposal to undertake the following remedial safety work:
(a) vehicle activated signs on both carriageways of the A.46 to alert oncoming traffic of the presence of vehicles at the junction waiting to join or cross the carriageways
(b) the installation of slim line bollards at the Station Road junction
(c) appropriate demarcation of the central reservation/turning area.

3. Evidence was given at the inquest that there is no date for the approval of funding or the commencement of the remedial safety work.

4. The national speed limit on Station Road on its approach to the junction with the A.46 is 60mph. The SCIO gave evidence that additional warning signs and a possible reduction in speed limit on the approach would provide additional safety for drivers who were unfamiliar with the Station Road and its approach to the junction. Nottinghamshire Police has offered to meet with Nottinghamshire County Council, the authority responsible for the maintenance of Station Road, and undertake a risk assessment."

He subsequently failed to respond to telephone calls and letters to attend appointments. He was therefore discharged from the service on the 21 June 2016.

There was no attempt to visit him during this period to try and re-engage him with services. He may not have received the correspondence inviting him for appointments because he was away on holiday for some of that period. He might have benefitted from having pre-arranged appointments prior to his discharge. His medication was changed during his last admission and thereafter does not appear to have been monitored.

The investigation concluded at an inquest on 18th September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was –

“Mr Cassidy died from a known drug allergy because its existence was not obtained by hospital medical staff from his Summary Care Record.”","In 2018 Barnet Hospital in London found Mr Cassidy to be allergic to Ceftriaxone and recorded this fact in his Summary Care Record (an electronic patient record). Mr Cassidy appears to have been unaware of his allergy – probably because he experienced it during a period of encephalitis such that he had no clear memory of it.

On 4th March 2023 Mr Cassidy fractured his hip and clinical staff from South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWAS) conveyed him by ambulance to Southmead Hospital, Bristol (SMH). SWAS staff were able to access the Summary Care Record, obtain the history of Ceftriaxone allergy and record this in their clinical record.

On admission to SMH a copy of the SWAS clinical record was scanned into the SMH records and a member of SMH emergency department nursing staff noted the Ceftriaxone allergy, but it was not acted upon further. Mr Cassidy was listed for surgical repair of his fractured hip the following day.

None of the doctors who assessed Mr Cassidy in the emergency department, the trauma and orthopaedics team or the anaesthetist at his operation were able to access the Summary Care Record to obtain the history of Ceftriaxone allergy and none of them were aware of it.

On 5th March 2023 Mr Cassidy was administered intravenous Ceftriaxone as part of routine induction of anaesthesia for his hip surgery. He immediately suffered a severe anaphylactic reaction to the Ceftriaxone from which he died shortly afterwards despite appropriate and extensive attempts to resuscitate him.

Despite the Ceftriaxone allergy being recorded on his Summary Care Record in 2018 and the potential fatal outcome of such a history being disregarded, the evidence at the Inquest demonstrated that –

a) There was no provision for clinical staff at SMH to access patients’ Summary Care Record routinely or easily;
b) This was despite provision existing for SWAS clinical staff to do so before a patient arrived at hospital;
c) There was no provision for the Summary Care Record to be integrated with SMH’s hospital electronic patient record (known as Careflow/Connect) or the primary care electronic patient record (EMIS – Egton Medical Information System) – such that the Ceftriaxone allergy automatically appeared in SMH’s electronic patient record;
d) As a result none of the emergency department doctors, the trauma and orthopaedics team or the anaesthetist who administered the antibiotic with induction were able to ascertain Mr Cassidy’s Ceftriaxone allergy;
e) This led to an avoidable fatal anaphylactic reaction.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Ms Wong was 32 years old when she died at the scene of a road traffic accident on 26 September 2021 on Headington Road, Oxford at the junction with Headley Way.

The conclusion was Road Traffic Collision with the following factual findings:

At approximately 09:55 hours on 26th September 2021 Jennifer Wong cycled along Headington Road towards traffic lights at the junction with Headley Way and cycled on the nearside of a stationery mobile crane. She was positioned on the nearside in a cycle lane intending to cycle straight on. The mobile crane was positioned in the nearside lane for vehicles turning left. On the lights changing Jennifer Wong and the mobile crane moved forwards and when the crane began to turn left into Headley Way it caused Jennifer Wong to be knocked to the ground and be run over, resulting in her instant death due to crush injuries.

I heard evidence from a number of witnesses at inquest along with other written statements and reports. I enclose the following documents for your information:

1. Police Report 	6/07/2022
2. Collision Investigators Report ([REDACTED]) - 19/04/2022
3. Report of [REDACTED] (Traffic Management Post Collision Report) 	6/10/2021
4. Statement of [REDACTED] of Oxfordshire County Council 01/08/2022
5. Record of Inquest

I heard oral evidence from the driver of the mobile crane and from [REDACTED]","Ms Wong was riding her pedal cycle on the morning of Sunday 26 September 2021 along Headington Road in Oxford and was intending to cycle straight across the junction. She was on the near side of a mobile crane intending to turn left into Headley Way. She was knocked off her pedal cycle by the crane and run over.

There were significant blind spots for the crane driver to the nearside. This is apparent from the report of [REDACTED] and the photographs therein. In addition to the issue of the blind spots, [REDACTED] also stated that an overarching issue is the cycle lane and the left turn at the traffic light junction which results in vulnerable road users coming into direct conflict with vehicles intending to turn left into Headley Way.","I note there have been audits both pre and post accident and, as outlined, I had the benefit of a statement and oral evidence from [REDACTED] of OCC, Group Manager Traffic and Road Safety.

I understand there are planned mitigation measures, to include amending the traffic signal timings to give advanced cycle priority on green. Further, there is the plan to drop the kerb to enable cyclists to join Headley Way off carriageway. I understood that the signal change and dropped kerb were due to take place in late August/September and I would be grateful if you could provide an update.

I also understand that OCC have committed to undertake a Stage 4 RSA Safety Audit after the works have been completed and it will be helpful if I could be provided with the result of this in due course. I also heard about a Vulnerable Road Users Audit and enquire if there is a place for this at the location.

During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make this report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. The first and main concern is in relation to the nearside cycle lane and what appeared to be an element of confusion or perhaps a dilemma for cyclists at this location intending to cycle straight across the junction. The cycle lane puts cyclists on the nearside of a lane that is specifically for vehicles turning right into Headley Way. There is the box/advanced stop line in front of the line of traffic in the lane but this requires the cyclist to decide to use it and, importantly, to have time to make it pass the nearside of the vehicles and into the box before the vehicles in the lane commence their right turn.

If there was no cycle lane, it appears more likely that a cyclist heading straight on. I believe that further consideration should be given to this issue and if improved signage has a part to play to mitigate the risks.

I appreciate of course that it is not possible to remove risk completely and cyclists will make different choices about where to position themselves at a junction such as this one. I anticipate that the junction is not dissimilar to many others in Oxford. The issue of cyclists in nearside blind spots, particularly involving large commercial vehicles with limited visibility, therefore presents a significant and ongoing risk.

2. The second concern relates to the width of the cycle lane. It is believed to be 0.95 metres wide at this location but the recommended width is 1.2m or perhaps 1.5m. I understand this is an issue which has already been raised following a site meeting. There may be valid reasons why the lane is the width it is but I would be grateful if this could be considered."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18th March 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision. Gordon N Davidson's cause of death was given as 1a) Traumatic Injuries related to a Road Traffic Accident and Grant T Benson's cause of death was given as 1a) Immediate Effects of Fire related to a Road Traffic Accident.",Both deceased were travelling in a motor vehicle which crashed and hit a tree. The passenger died either at the time of the collision or soon thereafter. The driver survived the initial impact and died in the ensuing fire.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  -

Between the time of the impact and him being incapable of further speech the driver had a conversation with an Ambulance Control call handler with a view to securing the attendance of the Emergency Services. This call lasted for several minutes and it is clear from listening to the recording how frantic the driver became as the fire began and took hold. The driver gave quite an accurate description of his approximate location to the call handler but the call handler was unable at any time during the call to accurately locate the whereabouts of the incident. Technological information given by GPS gave an inaccurate location for the incident. The emergency call was routed to Yorkshire Ambulance Service rather than to North East Ambulance Service which would have been based in Newcastle Upon Tyne. The call handler with Yorkshire ambulance Service was based in Wakefield. She had no personal knowledge of the area. Despite having a map in front of her and the assistance of two other members of staff looking over her shoulder and trying to assist it was not possible for an ambulance to be dispatched. The call handler in evidence said that she repeated certain key information to the caller but that is not recorded. She gave evidence that she would have covered the microphone to speak to colleagues in trying to locate the incident. Her evidence was inconsistent. It is accepted in evidence that an option might have been to have sought further and urgent advice from a more local agency, the North East Ambulance Trust or possibly Durham Police or Durham and Darlington Fire Rescue Service. Evidence was given that it is not possible to transfer responsibility for calls from one emergency service to another and the only means of further communication would be by telephone. The evidence was clear that in cross boundary area situations there are inadequate systems in place to secure the best possible response to an incident. It is not possible for one ambulance service to dispatch an ambulance from another ambulance service. Evidence was given that a suitable ambulance had been identified to be sent to this incident based at Richmond North Yorkshire with an estimated journey time of 28 minutes. There was an ambulance station situated in Barnard Castle (and incidentally a Police Station and Fire Station) which is only some 5 minutes or so travelling time away from the incident location. Because of the difficulties in establishing an exact location, at no time did Yorkshire Ambulance have sufficient information to despatch an ambulance. Emergency services only attended the scene of the incident once a further call had been made to the Emergency Services by a member of the public. The evidence in this case was that even if the local Fire Brigade had been promptly summond, an appropriate appliance would not have reached the incident scene sufficiently quickly to have changed the outcome i.e. the death of the driver. The evidence however, reveals system shortcomings which may in other circumstances lead to avoidable deaths taking place and therefore a review by the Emergency Services of a joined up approach could be particularly useful, in addition to a comprehensive review of call handling procedures in difficult circumstances such as these."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I heard on 21st February and 12th March 2018.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Mrs Hall died as a consequence of acute heart failure. Although Mrs Hall had underlying ischaemic heart disease, her heart failure was precipitated by very advanced B Cell lymphoma which had not been diagnosed at the time of her death. The conclusion of the inquest was natural causes.","Mrs Hall first presented to her GP with symptoms of left leg and back pain on 22nd May 2017. The pain was not relieved by anti-inflammatories, and continued to progress with increasing analgesia requirements over the course of the summer.

On 19th July 2017, Mrs Hall attended the Emergency Department of The Royal Oldham hospital, complaining of palpitations and a raised heart rate. She was discharged following examination and investigations with a request that her GP arrange cardiology follow up.

On 9th August 2017, Mrs Hall attended her GP with leg swelling. Her GP referred her to the Vascular Studies centre at Tameside General Hospital where, the following day a scan confirmed the presence of an extensive Deep Venous Thrombosis. Mrs Hall was admitted to hospital for further investigations, pain relief and anti-coagulant therapy.

There then followed a series of admissions and attendances to Tameside General Hospital, culminating in Mrs Hall's sad death on 8th September 2017. The medical cause of Mrs Hall's death was:

1)a) Acute left ventricular failure;

b) B Cell lymphoma on background of ischaemic heart disease.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

Following Mrs Hall's attendance at the Royal Oldham Emergency Department, a letter was written to her GP which included the text 'Bloods and ECG all normal'. The evidence before the court was that contrary to this statement, Mrs Hall's full blood count was, in fact, abnormal, with a slightly low haemoglobin at 96 grams / litre.

[REDACTED] Consultant in Emergency Medicine, explained in his evidence that in contrast to other systems which operate across the Trust whereby complete sets of results are automatically incorporated into discharge letters, the Emergency Department system is currently predicated on junior doctors accurately transcribing significant individual results.

In addition to increasing the chances for errors of the sort that occurred in this case, it is a matter of concern that the absence of a complete set of blood results in discharge letters reduces the potential for GPs to compare results with others on their own systems, reducing the opportunity for trend analysis.

Mrs Prior had died as a result of (1a) Global hypoxic ischaemic injury to the brain (1b) Hypoxia (1c) Facial injuries sustained in a witnessed fall (29/10/13) (II) Debridement and closure of facial laceration. MUA plus oris of fractured nasal bones. Closure of intra oral laceration (successful 30/10/13). I determined that ""The deceased died from a cardiac arrest following a fall caused by her underlying medical condition.""","Denise Prior died from the consequences of a cardiac arrest following a fall, which in turn had been caused by her underlying medical condition.

During the inquest considerable attention was given to the concerns of Mrs Prior's family arising from the records of Mrs Prior's treatment at St Richards, which is part of the West Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. In particular the records of her oxygen levels on 30th and 31st October 2013 were examined at length.

I heard evidence from several witnesses employed by the Trust, and concluded that there was conflicting evidence as to the precise reason for her cardiac arrest but no evidence to support a finding that on the balance of probabilities her cardiac arrest had been caused by any failure by the Trust or its employees to administer oxygen or any other treatment required by her condition.

Nevertheless I expressed serious concerns about the standard of record-keeping on the Middleton Ward of St Richard's hospital. I found that the evidence showed particularly in respect of the Patient Observation Charts and the application of the 'National Early Warning Score' ('NEWS') system
(i) that the 'O2 SATS' entries had been completed in the wrong line on four occasions on 30th October;
(ii) that the total score of Mrs Prior's readings had been incorrectly calculated on five occasions on 30th October;
(iii) that on three occasions on 30th October the patient's total 'NEWS' score amounted to 5, while individual scores of her oxygen levels were at '3' on one occasion on 30th October, and that according to the notes about the 'NEWS' system any total of 5 or individual score of 3 required monitoring to be increased in frequency ""to a minimum of 1 hourly"" and for a ""trained nurse to urgently inform the medical team caring for the patient"" and for an ""urgent assessment within 1 hour by a clinician with core competencies to assess acutely ill patients."" There was no record that these steps were taken nor of the outcome, nor alternatively that any reasons existed why they should not be taken, nor that any assessment had been made that Mrs Prior's ""normal parameters"" would have allowed a more relaxed monitoring regime or application of the 'NEWS' system;
(iv) that while nurses were expected to use their experience in assessing the condition of patients and the course of action required, including any departure from the 'NEWS' system, the observation charts did not include any written record of such an assessment having been made, nor any cross-reference to any other records that might suggest that alternative courses of action were justified;
(v) that the Prescription and Administration charts contained no record of oxygen being prescribed nor of the level of such prescription;
(vi) that while supplementary evidence was given that steps had already been taken to introduce a computerised 'Patient Track' record system in the previous 2 years, and that such a system would ensure that observations were recorded correctly and that 'NEWS' score totals and alerts would be correctly indicated, that system had not been working on 30th and 31st October and on other occasions, during which the paper records already referred to were used instead, and would be used again in the future during any breakdown; moreover the computerised system did not in any event record the prescription of oxygen levels, and an oxygen administration audit had not yet been commissioned.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

That there is a risk of other deaths occurring in the future from the inadequacy of record-keeping practices at St Richards Hospital in the recording of oxygen levels and its prescription, and in the application or departure from the 'NEWS' system."

Sheffield City Council (Planning),"On 8th May 2012 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ahmad Doumani Khan (aged 20 years). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21st January 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr. Khan died from multiple injuries sustained in a fall from the top level of the Q Park car park, St. Paul's Square, Sheffield. The narrative conclusion stated that no other person was directly involved in the fall, but it was also not clear if Mr. Khan intended to take his own life.","On the morning of the 3rd May 2012 Mr. Khan was in Sheffield city centre, with friends. Mr Khan was known to have problems, and he sent text messages to persons at that time. However, he was also indicating plans he had for later that day, and into the future. CCTV shows that Mr. Khan and a friend were in the area of the Q Park car park from 1300 hours to 1710 hours on that date. They were seen to walk up through the lift area of the car park and eventually they went onto the top floor, which is uncovered. There is no CCTV coverage of the area where Mr. Khan fell from. Mr. Khan was with his friend when he got on to the perimeter wall, near to a corner of the car park. A short while later he fell, witnessed both by his friend and a person in a nearby building. Mr. Khan's friend indicated that when he, Mr. Khan, was stood on the perimeter wall, at the corner, Mr. Khan was only about 3 feet above him.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

There is the height issue (only about 3 feet), but also the fact that inside the wall is a crash/protective barrier for the parking of cars, which was described by the friend as being used by Mr. Khan as a 'step', up on to the wall. The concern is that any person, of almost any age, and certainly much younger than Mr. Khan, could quickly and easily gain access to the top of the perimeter, wall for any purpose. Such access is clearly dangerous."

During the course of the inquest evidence was heard from a number of witnesses of the supervision and staffing arrangements within SACU. The overall position was that there was no supervising officer present on a day to day basis to ensure key tasks were always allocated or completed, and officers, including officers not posted to the SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various tasks between themselves on an adhoc basis.

On the 2nd September 2019 the document setting out which hourly checks had been undertaken in the SACU was incomplete. No check on Mr Todds cell took place at 3pm that day.

Evidence was heard that staffing levels can vary, with officers being occupied on tasks which meant hourly checks could not always be completed.

Whilst there is auditing of the hourly checks retrospectively, there is no real time system which would alert officers and their supervisors to checks being incomplete for a prisoner/s as the record of checks are paper based and held in the SACU, as well there is no constant supervising officer present or other system there to ensure compliance."

He was being closely monitored and was resident on the older prisoners unit. His health had been deteriorating for some time and he was diagnosed with a chest infection on the 5th of April 2012. On the 24th of April 2012, a healthcare assistant entered his cell to carry out a check and found him unresponsive. Medical help was summoned but he could not be revived and was pronounced dead. No post mortem was carried out and I accepted at the inquest the evidence of the treating doctor that the cause of death was: Ia Chest infection
Ib Chronic Kidney Disease
Ic Diabetes Mellitus

II Atrial Fibrillation","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. –

Prisoners accommodated in the Older Prisoners Unit of HM Prison Norwich do not have appropriate access to speech and language therapists who can provide assessments to those with swallowing difficulties and make necessary recommendations as to their medical management including the regulation of fluid and food intake and the provision of a soft diet.

This omission was acknowledged at the hearing by a professional witness for the health service provider of Norwich Prison SERCO."

I found that the cause of death was:

I a Blunt chest and abdominal trauma

I concluded with a narrative conclusion as follows:

Melanie Jane Elms was an informal patient at the Abraham Cowley Unit and had a history of schizo-affective disorder and of suicidal attempts. On 30th January 2018 she requested day leave from the unit for part of the day. A mandatory risk assessment which should have been undertaken by a nurse before Melanie left the unit was not carried out and consequently she was permitted to leave the unit without her mental state be assessed and therefore was unclear. There was a failure by the Unit to record, consider and thereafter act upon concerns made to it by her husband regarding Melanie's welfare during the day. At about 20.37, Melanie entered [REDACTED] After a short period spent on the [REDACTED] whereupon she deliberately [REDACTED] . As a result she suffered fatal injuries that led to her death .Whilst her intention at the time of the event is unclear her mental health condition materially contributed to her death.

I adjourned consideration of whether to write a report for the prevention of future deaths for further evidence to be provided.","i.) Melanie struggled with significant mental health problems including schizo-affective disorder, alcohol addiction, depression and severe post-natal depression. Melanie had several admissions under the Mental Health Act 1983. She was married with one son.
ii.) On 21st July 2017 she was discharged from a two and a half year admission under the Mental Health Act 1983. Between 21st July and 24th July 2017 she was discharged to a crisis house.
iii.) Her treating doctor had created a care package to allow Melanie to cope in the community. It included carers visiting Melanie every day. However, until they were able to start a short term arrangement was made. The proper package of care was never put in place.
iv.) Between July 2017 and December 2017 Melanie and her family struggled with her return to the community and the limited package of care.
v.) Her husband struggled to support Melanie on the limited package of care she was receiving. He made numerous calls to CMHRS asking for more support and more care particularly because Children Services' concerns remained.
vi.) On 2nd October after Melanie had been assessed by the HTT having committed self-harm with suicidal intentions which she later denied, she was found a crisis house and Martyn asked for her to be allowed to stay longer but was told no. On 26th October Melanie with some insight asked to return to the crisis house.
vii.) As things unravelled for Melanie, on 9th December 2017 her husband and son returned to the family home to find it filled with black smoke. Fire services attended and found Melanie asleep upstairs and refusing to leave. She was responsible for starting the fire by putting cigarettes into the sink pipes. It is not clear if she knew what she was doing.
viii.) As a result of this incident, Melanie was admitted to Blake Ward, ACU as an informal patient.
ix.) Due to the seriousness of the incidents in the family home some of which were in front of her son, and that the final incident had rendered the family home unliveable until made safe and refurbished, Children's Services required stronger measures in place to protect [REDACTED]. These included a Non-Molestation Order and Occupation Order.
x.) On 22nd December 2017 Melanie's treating doctor was changed to someone who did not have a detailed knowledge of her last admission.
xi.) As an informal patient, Melanie was allowed leave unrestricted. There seemed from the evidence at that time to be a culture that informal patients were not challenged about leave and therefore although there were some checks that were in place were not being performed as rigorously as they could have been. The ""walk book"" the record of those on leave from the ward is a sparse document and no recording of risk is made on the face of it. This along with a number of other things has been changed subsequent to Melanie's death.
xii.) On 15th December Melanie had leave and she had been expected back at 18.25. By 2200 the ward staff started to call Melanie's phone and her husband's phone. Her husband had not been notified of her leave. She was found at 2300 to have returned to the fire-damaged home address intoxicated and distressed and she reported to her husband that she was having a miscarriage and was bleeding. Ambulance and police attended and Melanie was found to have wound. Melanie was returned via A&E to Blake Ward. There were reports that she had smashed things in the house. Melanie was not pregnant and had not been.
xiii.) Between the 16th and 19th December nurses were concerned she would abscond and used their temporary holding powers to stop her leaving.
xiv.) On 19th December she used her leave at around 1330. The ward received a telephone call that Melanie was in the local pub and was behaving bizarrely. Staff had to retrieve her from the pub.
xv.) She had leave between 22nd and 24th December without incident.
xvi.) On 29th December Melanie used leave and did not return on time, concerns were raised at 2200 and she was classified as a missing person. The ward received a telephone call from A&E where Melanie had gone because she was concerned she was having a miscarriage. Melanie was not pregnant and had not been.
xvii.) Melanie had two further periods of leave which went without incident.
xviii.) On 10th Jan 2018 – a Child Protection Meeting about her son was convened and Melanie did not attend but was very distressed and angry about it. She used leave at 1300 and stayed out half an hour beyond the expected time intoxicated.
xix.) On 13th January she used leave for an hour without any incidents On 16th January 2018- she used leave and called the ward to say she would be late. She had attended the temporary accommodation where her family were staying.. Melanie was alleged to have broken glass and assaulted police officers and she was taken into police custody. Melanie was bailed and returned to the ward on 17th.
xx.)On 19th January and 21st January – she used leave without incident. On 22 January Melanie went out early and did not return until 2100. On 23rd January she went out several times, no issues On 25th January- Melanie went on leave and returned smelling of alcohol and was abusive to staff
xxi.) On 26th January- her husband called the ward because Melanie was expressing suicidal intetions. On 27 January- although described as agitated and erratc, she used leave without issues On 28th January- she used leave and was irritable and aggressive on return. On 29 January she used leave no issues
xxii.) On one of the leaves, not clear which one, Melanie was wandering in Ottershaw and was found in the dark by a mechanic who helped her to return to the ward.
xxiii.) On 30th January 2018 Melanie was RAG rated green. This has been explained as a traffic light system of risk which is given to each patient daily. The ward was very busy and her allocated nurse was unable to go through Melanie's care plan with her. The ward was also reliant on agency nurses: they were qualified to do the work but were not allowed access to the computer recording system for putting notes onto the system.
xxiv.) Melanie went on leave at some point during the day shift. The only recording of this in the notes is retrospectively. The walk book which is a handwritten document filled in by the nurse who is signing any person out of the ward and which should include details of when the person is expected back and what they were wearing so that a missing person report can be filed with the police if any when necessary.
xxv.) However, on the 30th January 2018 no risk assessment was undertaken of Melanie before she left the ward. There is no walk book for her and no trace of the nurse who granted her leave on that day.
xxvi.) What is known about 30th January 2018: Melanie went to the Sainsburys in Chertsey and rang her husband to tell him that she couldn't get back to the ward and that she felt weird. She did not describe or explain how. It was unclear why she couldn't get back as it was a short walk away. She was asking to be picked up. Her husband was not able to pick her up due to commitments to their son and because of how he had been advised to handle Melanie's requests. This was at about 16.30.
xxvii.) Melanie's husband called the ward just after this call. The Systemone notes written retrospectively on 31st refer to a call at 20.30 from her husband. An agency nurse took the call but the notes about it were entered by the allocated nurse from what she had overheard.
xxviii.) Melanie's husband called again around 20.00 and this is supported by the retrospective entry although that is timed as being at 20.30 but is not a contemporaneous record. By this time the night shift staff were on duty and Melanie had still not returned. Her husband was concerned that she had been a short walk away from the facility at 16.30 wanting to return and 3 1/2 hours later had not returned.
xxix.) At about 20.00 her husband received a telephone call from his local gym where both he and Melanie were regular members. Melanie had asked the gym to use the phone and she had called Melanie's husband. Melanie said she was trying to find her mum and couldn't find her. Melanie's mum lived in a house in Thames Ditton. Melanie's husband tried to ascertain if Melanie had been drinking and where she had been since her last call. She became impatient and handed the phone back to the gym receptionist who stated that Melanie was saying she was going to get a taxi and no longer wanted a lift. Melanie's husband telephoned the ward again to say where she was and what had happened.
xxx.) Melanie's husband was concerned about Melanie and thought given the mention of her mum that Melanie might have been at her mum's. He called her mum but Melanie was not there and had not been in touch and her mum was angry and refused to go to the end of the road to look for Melanie.
xxxi.) Melanie's mum told her son who lived with her about the call and they made a plan with Melanie's husband about where to search for her and began looking for her.
xxxii.) A train driver was driving the 20.54 Hampton Court to Waterloo train with headcode [REDACTED] and it had left Hampton Court station to begin its journey. It was clear dark dry evening. The train had conducted a running brake test just after leaving Hamptin Court station. The journey between Hampton Court station and Thames Ditton Station was about two minutes. The train had not yet reached the far end of the station platform known as the country end so no part of the train was yet adjacent to the platform. The train driver described seeing a woman [REDACTED] As soon as he saw her he applied the emergency brakes. [REDACTED]
xxxiii.) There was not enough time for the train to stop. The train struck the woman, who was later identified via fingerprints as Melanie, and her body came to rest under the second or third carriage of the train. ROLE was declared at 21.30 by a paramedic.
xxxiv.) Among her belongings some notes were found that seem to be addressed to her son. These notes do not look as if they were written all at the same time. They cannot be classified as suicide notes and do not disclose an intention to commit suicide. They do show a distressed state of mind.
xxxv.) From what can be ascertained from toxicology results she had in her system some of her therapeutic medications at a therapeutic dose. She also had a blood alcohol of 68 ml/dL this is a low concentration and she would not have been likely to have been intoxicated on this concentration, particularly given her tolerance to alcohol. However, the toxicologist is also unable to say if there had been an excess ingestion of drugs due to the effect of rapid death. There is no evidence that Melanie was under the influence of drugs or that she had ingested a larger quantity than her usual therapeutic dose as dispensed at the ACU.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

1. The care package arranged for Melanie following discharge from lengthy in-patient admission was not followed and was altered to something which the treating doctor did not consider adequate.

2. The walk book was not properly completed.

3. There was no extra planning for changes in circumstances: Melanie faced never being allowed to return to family life with her husband and son due to Child In Need proceedings; changes in medication and less support from family due to the Social Services requirements.

4. There was no missing person plan in place with timeframe and steps of escalation for Melanie's leave.

5. Risk assessment prior to leave was not adequate.

6. Risk assessment prior to leave was not recorded."

Chief Executive, [REDACTED], West Sussex County Council, County Hall, Chichester, West Sussex",On 16 December 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Brian James EASEY aged 79. The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not been heard.,"Mr Easey was diagnosed with mesothelioma in September 2020. He provided a witness statement dated 21.10.20 setting out an account of his work exposure to asbestos as follows:

In 1965 Mr Easey began working as a registrar for the London Borough of Lambeth and later became a deputy superintendent. He worked there for 19 years. Mr Easey believed that he was exposed to asbestos whilst working at 340 Brixton Road, on a daily basis he would frequently have to enter a fire-proof, strong-room repository room that is believed to have been clad with asbestos. The room was very dusty and the registers would be covered with layers of dust. He stated he often picked them up and used his arm to remove the dust or blew on it to disperse it. There was no ventilation was in the room.

Mr Easey later started working for West Sussex County Council (WSCC) in 1984 as a superintendent registrar. For the first 16 years working for WSCC he was based at 15 Mill Road, Worthing. Mr Easey stated that he was exposed to asbestos in the fireproof repository, as the door contained asbestos and the walls were made from asbestos insulation boards. Mr Easey stated that he would enter the room frequently on a daily basis. Mr Easey would brush away the dust with his sleeve causing the dust to be released into the air around him. Mr Easey would often search for records and be leaning against the walls which would leave dust marks on his clothes.

Mr Easey has stated that in around 2006 WSCC decided to relocate to Centenary House in Worthing and due to this Mr Easey spent a lot of time in the room moving records and preparing them for transportation. He described it as an extremely dusty process. He undertook this work alone and would be covered in dust by the end of his day. The records relocated to Centenary House were located in a larger modern strong room.

In August 2020 Mr Easey began feeling breathless and as a result he was sent for a CT scan and tests. He was diagnosed with biphasic mesothelioma on 17 September 2020 and died from this condition on 13 December 2020.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

(1) In view of Mr Easey’s description of the dust present on the council records in both locations there appears to me a real risk that that these records were, and remain, contaminated with asbestos fibres;

(2) Should there currently be asbestos fibres present on the records this presents a risk of asbestos exposure to all those whose come into contact with the records with an associated risk of developing fatal mesothelioma."

Ms Maggie Oldham, Chief Executive, Isle of Wight NHS Trust 2. Executive Director of Clinical Governance at St Mary’s Hospital, Newport, Isle of Wight 3. Care Quality Commission","On 17th July 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joseph Peter Dunne, aged 58. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12th July 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was a short narrative conclusion as follows:

“Joseph Peter DUNNE initially presented at his GP's surgery on 14th July 2015 complaining of pain around his ribs. The examining GP consulted a senior colleague and they requested a 999 ambulance fearing that this was Cardiac related. Upon arrival at St Marys Hospital, a junior doctor took a history and examined the patient before requesting various tests and investigations. The abnormally high d-dimer result was phoned back to the A&E department and although there is evidence that this was added to the patient's electronic notes before being deleted again, due to Information Governance breaches, it cannot be said that the junior doctor saw this abnormal result before discharging the patient back to his home address with analgesia and antibiotics. The deceased subsequently saw his GP the next day and was examined and plans were made for the District Nurse to visit him. He was found collapsed at home by the District Nurse the next day and died shortly thereafter.”

The medical cause of death was found to be:
1a Peritionitis
1b Perforated Duodenal Ulcer
1c
II","1) Joseph Peter Dunne was born on 17th January 1957. At the time of his death he was 58 years old and worked as a chef.

2) Mr Dunne was a relatively heavy drinker, drinking approximately 10 cans of lager a day and smoking approximately 20 cigarettes a day. He had been diagnosed with diabetes and had hypertension which was controlled with medication. He had recently lost a lot of weight.

3) On Tuesday 14th July, Mr Dunne visited his GP complaining of pain down one side and generally feeling unwell. As the GP feared that the pain might be cardiac related, an ambulance was requested, which took him to the A&E Department of St Mary’s Hospital, Newport, Isle of Wight, arriving at approximately 6 p.m. Mr Dunne then had various routine tests and investigations carried out during the 4 hours that he was at St Mary’s Hospital. These included tests for D-dimer and a chest x-ray which were ordered by the FY2 doctor who examined Mr Dunne. The D-dimer results were authorised in the laboratory at 20.27 hours and phoned through to another Emergency Department doctor at approximately 20.30 hours. This result was entered into the clinical record under the FY2 year doctor’s login at 20.30 hours (but the person who entered the information is unidentifiable). There was a further entry with regard to the chest x-ray results. Both the entries for the D-dimer and the chest x-ray were deleted simultaneously on Mr Dunne’s notes. The FY2 doctor then re-entered the information at 21.38 hours in Mr Dunne’s records about the chest x-ray alone. The D-dimer result was not re-transcribed. It was believed that the FY2 may have deleted the earlier results as they had been entered under another user’s login. Regrettably, no consideration and weight was later given to the D-dimer result.

4) Mr Dunne was subsequently discharged at approximately 10 p.m. that evening with a diagnosis of suspected pleurisy.

5) The following day, Mr Dunne attended his GP’s surgery and complained that he still felt unwell. His GP arranged for him to be visited at home by the Community Matron on Thursday 16th July.

6) On Thursday 16th July, Mr Dunne got up but still felt unwell so he soon returned to bed. His partner went out at 10 a.m. At approximately 2 p.m. the Community Matron attended his house and he was found by her to be collapsed by conscious on the living room floor. He was very cold with a temperature of 34.2C. His partner was summonsed and she returned home. At around 2.15 p.m. Mr Dunne indicated that he wished to use the toilet. He was supported by his partner to reach the toilet. Whilst on the toilet he suddenly became unresponsive and collapsed to the floor. An ambulance was immediately summonsed and CPR was undertaken by the Community Matron. When the paramedics attended, they took over the CPR, however there were no signs of life and he was pronounced dead at 3.20 p.m.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:  –

1. I am concerned that there are clear breaches in Information Governance protocols. It is clear that there are IG issues which allow one Clinician to make entries or delete information from a patient’s medical records, when they are not correctly logged in to the database, or are doing so under a colleague’s log-in (which remains live after they’ve walked away from the computer terminal). Matters are compounded inasmuch as these edits are then found to be invisible to those clinicians who are actually treating the patient, and are only ascertainable when an IT audit trail is undertaken. It should not be possible for Doctor A to be able to access records made by Doctor B and to alter those medical records."
116,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/olaseni-lewis/,2017-0205,2017-06-28,Selena Lynch,South London,"1. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police 2. Chief Executive, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust","On 13th September 2010 Dr Roy Palmer commenced an investigation into the death of Olaseni Lewis 23. The investigation concluded before me at the end of the inquest on 9th May 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Lewis died from hypoxic brain injury caused by restraint in association with acute behavioural disturbance. The jury recorded a narrative conclusion, (set out on the attached sheet and summarised in paragraph 4 below)","Mr Lewis developed symptoms of an acute psychotic illness and was taken to the Maudsley Hospital in South London. Later the same day he was admitted to Gresham Ward at Bethlem Royal Hospital as an informal patient. He became agitated and was restrained by healthcare staff, detained under the Mental Health Act, and given medication.

Hospital staff requested police assistance. Police officers placed Mr Lewis in handcuffs and took him to a seclusion room. Mr Lewis became agitated and fearful, and resisted efforts to leave him in the seclusion room. Officers restrained him but were unable to gain control. Leg restraints were applied and additional officers attended, but control was not achieved until eventually Mr Lewis became unconscious and suffered a cardiac arrest.

The jury concluded that the Hospital Trust failed to meet training targets, that there was a lack of communication between police and medical staff, that the restraint was prolonged disproportionate and unreasonable, that police failed to follow their training to administer basic life support, and that medical staff failed to respond to the medical emergency.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) The court was told that officers are not expected to read Standing Operating Procedures and the Officer Safety Manual, and there is little ""required reading"" or ready reference for police officers regarding restraint techniques and dangers.

(2) Officers had been taught about Acute Behavioural Disturbance (ABD) but most did not recognise that Mr Lewis was suffering from ABD. The training on ABD appeared unnecessarily complicated and was not fully understood by officers. They incorrectly assumed that it was a formal diagnosis of some sort and that healthcare professionals would be able to recognise and treat the condition. An expert psychiatrist indicated that the description might be helpful for police in the community, particularly when the condition is caused by drugs, but it causes difficulty when police and mental health services work together and where the underlying cause is related to mental illness. The question that arose was whether it is necessary to attach a label at all. It might be more easily understood if officers are taught that people who resist restraint and appear to be suffering from mental illness may not respond as expected, and are therefore more vulnerable to die suddenly during restraint.

(3) Police were taught that prolonged restraint was dangerous, but had no idea what ""prolonged"" meant, and were left to use their own judgement. They also seemed to think that prolonged restraint referred to time spent in a prone position and that as long as the detainee was held on his/her side the danger was ameliorated or removed. The pathological and psychiatric expert evidence clearly indicated that restraint in any position can lead to sudden death in patients who are highly agitated. The jury found that the police training was inadequate in its definition of ""prolonged restraint"" for people exhibiting signs of ABD.

(4) Police officers were given no advice or training what they could or should do if control was not achieved within a given period of time.

(5) There was no training or understanding about the respective roles and responsibilities of healthcare and police staff. There was (and still is) no Memorandum of Understanding.

(6) The jury concluded that medical staff requested police assistance due to a lack of trained and physically able medical staff. The Trust had a policy for closing wards or placing them in special measures when training levels fell below a given level, but this was not followed and there was a lack of clarity around who was responsible for assessing compliance"

Her medical cause of death was recorded as: 1a) metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix","The brief circumstances were ... Julie O'Connor had a smear test in September 2014 which was reported as normal when it was not; she was examined by gynaecologists who did not diagnose her condition in August and November 2016. It was not until she was seen in March 2017 that she was appropriately diagnosed and treated for cervical cancer. Unfortunately despite treatment at that time her condition deteriorated, she developed metastatic disease due to the delayed diagnosis and she died on 4th February 2019 at St Peter's Hospice from metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

In this case as well as the fact that the smear test was incorrectly reported there were also 2 occasions when there was a failure to recognise a clinically obvious cancer of the cervix or a failure to recognise a need for further assessment in August and November 2016. In addition the evidence of the experts was that the abnormal appearance of the cervix should also have been diagnosed in February 2017.

The North Bristol NHS Trust have developed a guide for ""the management of abnormal cervix, ectropian, and post coital bleeding""* and it is the view of the trust that if this guide had been in place at the time that Julie's medical condition would have been picked up earlier.

The conclusion was a detailed narrative conclusion. The medical cause of death was 1a Methadone intoxication. 1b Alcohol withdrawal in a chronic alcoholic. II Fatty infiltration of the liver.,"On Saturday 2nd October 2011 the deceased was arrested on a no-bail warrant and taken to the Northern Area Custody Facility, Etruria, Stoke-on-Trent. He had a history of (former) heroin abuse, was receiving prescribed medication but he was also an admitted heavy abuser of alcohol, drinking over 10 cans of strong lager each day. He remained in custody, at times under close observation, for lengthy periods being viewed through a cell camera, was seen by four doctors on 6 separate occasions and received medication in the form of his prescribed methadone plus diazepam and chlordiazepoxide for alcohol withdrawal. He was found unresponsive in his cell shortly before 9.00pm on Sunday 3rd October 2011. Although attended upon by doctors there was evidence of poor or no communication between doctors and custody sergeants and frequent misunderstandings over the required level of observation. It was accepted that these failures did not materially cause or contribute to death and that some steps have been taken to correct failings. There is potential for failings to occur nationally. I recommend that the following be considered (see paragraph 5 below).","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

1. That consideration be given to issuing guidance that whenever a detainee is attended upon by a medical practitioner there should be a verbal consultation between the medical practitioner and custody sergeant as to any issues of concern and the level of observations to be had for that detainee in addition to the medical practitioner making detailed notes on the detainee's custody medical record.
2. That consideration be given to the provision of joint training exercises for medical practitioners, custody sargeants and custody detention officers and assistants.
3. That training should provide targeted emphasis on the correct levels of observation.
4. That consideration should be given to eliminating the phrase 'continue observations at the current level' and require that doctors and custody sargeants specify the level of observation precisely.
5. That training should include targeted training on the risks and dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, including methadone intoxication and alcohol withdrawal, particularly if the detainee is likely to be in custody for upwards of 24 hours."

The investigation concluded with an inquest heard on 16 November 2022. The Coroner returned a narrative conclusion.","On 9 February 2022 Roy Middleton fell at his home address in Sheffield and struck his head.

A carer requested emergency medical assistance at 16:41 advising the Yorkshire Ambulance Service that he was taking warfarin; he had a large cut to his head and there was 'quite a lot' of bleeding. The call was allocated a category 3 response time with a 90% centile target of 2 hours.

A second call was made to the Yorkshire Ambulance Service by a carer at 19:52 requesting an update on the arrival of an ambulance and expressing concern Mr Middleton was concussed. The call was allocated a category 3 response time.

At 20:30 a paramedic from the clinical hub at Yorkshire Ambulance Service called and spoke to Mr Middleton's son who described a 4-inch laceration to the back of Mr Middleton's head and that Mr Middleton was becoming impatient and worried. He was also concerned about the amount of blood and stated his father was frail and concussed. The call was allocated a category 3 response time. This assessment was not performed correctly, and the call should have been changed to a category 2 which would have resulted in an ambulance would have arrived sooner.

At 22:04 a call was made by Mr Middleton's son to Yorkshire Ambulance Service requesting an update on the arrival of an ambulance and stating his father's condition had not changed.

A resource was allocated at 22:33 and arrived on scene at 22:47, 6 hours and 6 minutes after the initial call.

Mr Middleton was taken to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield where he was diagnosed with a traumatic acute subdural haemorrhage which was not fit for medical intervention. He died in hospital on 10 Feb 2022 as a result of this injury.

The medical cause of death found was:

1a. Traumatic acute subdural haemorrhage
2. Atrial fibrillation, tricuspid valve replacement (anticoagulated), Type II diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

The narrative conclusion given was as follows:

Roy Middleton fell at his home address on 9 February 2022. Emergency medical assistance was requested but did not arrive until six hours and six minutes after the request was made due to service demands and a missed opportunity to re-categorise the call.

Mr Middleton was admitted to the Northern General Hospital where he was diagnosed with a traumatic acute subdural haemorrhage. He died in hospital on 10 February 2022 as a result of this injury.

Had he presented at hospital sooner it is possible he could have been treated but it cannot be said whether he would have survived.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows:-

The inquest heard that the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch system algorithm does not take into account whether a patient is on blood thinning medication when considering the category of emergency response required. The inquest also heard from a consultant geriatrician that ""by the time he arrived at the hospital he was not fit for any intervention"".

I am concerned that if the algorithm isn't changed to take into account the affect of anti-coagulant medication on a head injury, deaths will occur in the future.

I am aware the Yorkshire Ambulance Service have raised the same concern with the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch as a result of this incident."

Chief Executive, Mid Cheshire NHS Trust",On 3rd May 2016 an investigation was commenced into the death of Charles Ray Woodward aged 67. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15th December 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased who had died as a result of peritonitis caused by virtue of a leaking anastomosis following surgery for cancer of the sigmoid colon had died by misadventure.,"On 20th April 2016 an operation was performed at Leighton Hospital, Crewe to remove a tumour involving the sigmoid colon. After an apparently uneventful period of recovery the deceased was discharged home from hospital on 22nd April 2016. At home the deceased's health declined. He ate and drank little, he became oliguric, his mobility decreased and it is likely that he had begun to suffer from the peritonitis which subsequently led to his death. Further it is likely that had the deceased remained in hospital the onset of peritonitis would have been recognised and an operation performed which might have saved him.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

There was inadequate communication and liaison between the hospital on the one hand and on the other hand the deceased's GP practice and district nurses in the community who, following the deceased's discharge from hospital, would be responsible for the deceased's ongoing care. Further, monitoring of the deceased's condition from Leighton Hospital was insufficiently robust and relied upon oral contact rather than ensuring the physical presence of a medical attendant, be that attendant hospital or community based. The evidence suggested that there was miscommunication between the hospital and the deceased's family with the result that the deceased's worrying decline in health was not appreciated by the hospital."

Julian Mark, Executive Medical Director, Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust;","On 17 October 2016 an Inquest was opened into the death of Ryan James Vout. That was concluded at the end of the inquest on 3 November 2017. The conclusion of the jury after the inquest was:

Medical cause of death:

Single stab wound to chest

How, when and where the deceased came by his death:

Whilst suffering from un-medicated paranoid schizophrenia and during an attempt by police officers to exercise a warrant obtained under section 135 Mental Health Act 1983, Ryan Vout stabbed himself in the left side of the chest with a knife. The knife penetrated the left lung and the left ventricle of the heart.
Ryan then removed the knife at the request of a police officer.
Despite emergency first aid and hospital treatment Ryan died at 2.28 p.m. on 10 August 2016 at Kingsmill Hospital, Sutton in Ashfield.

Conclusion of the jury as to death:

Ryan Vout died as a result of a self-inflicted stab wound administered whilst suffering from un-medicated paranoid schizophrenia.","Since about the end of 2006/beginning of 2007, Ryan had been diagnosed with what [REDACTED], Community Consultant Psychiatrist, described as relapsing and remitting paranoid schizophrenia accompanied by persecutory ideas about the police; auditory hallucinations; grandiose thoughts and speech.
His condition tended to be well controlled when he maintained his drug regimen. During the intervening 9 ½ years prior to Ryan’s death his symptoms fluctuated requiring occasional, sometimes extensive, periods as an inpatient.
Immediately before his discharge on 1 August 2016, Ryan had been an inpatient at Millbrook Hospital, Nottinghamshire since 5 May 2016.
Concerns were quickly raised by family and community mental health professionals that Ryan’s mental health had deteriorated in the 7 or 8 days or so since his discharge from Millbrook Hospital. Most likely, (on the basis of evidence of the absence of any trace of prescribed anti-psychotic medication (here risperidone) in the post mortem toxicological samples), Ryan had stopped taking his oral medication.
On 9 August 2016, [REDACTED] (Approved Mental Health Practitioner (AMHP)) began the process of obtaining a warrant under s.135 (1) MHA 1983, informed local police of his intention to do so and made arrangements to meet officers so that the warrant could be executed.
The warrant was obtained in the morning of 10 August 2016. PB informed the police and arrangements made to meet at the address at which it was believed Ryan would be found.
At around 1pm on [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] met at the relevant address and prepared to exercise the warrant. By reason of some information exchange, but in the absence of formal risk assessment, all were aware that Ryan had expressed views that he would take his own life if he saw a police officer (attempt to ‘section’ him) and that knives might be secreted at the property.
Body worn camera footage and audio obtained by [REDACTED] revealed that, as the officers made their way into the premises and announced their arrival, Ryan expressed fear at their presence and then retreated into an upstairs bedroom where he plunged a kitchen knife into his chest which, as it transpired, damaged his left lung and punctured the left ventricle. Emergency First Aid and hospitalisation could not save Ryan.
From call out following [REDACTED] radio request, the EMAS emergency ambulance took six minutes to arrive at the address.
In the course of the evidence it became clear that it was not possible to ‘pre-book’ an ambulance as the most appropriate means of transport for a potential psychiatric patient.
The evidence also revealed that the competing emergency calls made upon the local ambulance provider (EMAS) meant that such pre-arrangement was incompatible with delivery of an emergency service. Although ambulances could be arranged once the AMHP and police officers arrived at the location where the warrant was to be exercised that request would not be treated as an emergency or a high priority (in the absence of threat to life).
All interested parties, especially the police, expressed frustration that within Nottinghamshire there is no alternative, dedicated, fully equipped ambulance, capable of being pre-booked for attendances such as the one in this case for the execution of s.135 MHA 1983 warrants (or detention under s136 MHA 1983).

Additionally, prior to Ryan’s discharge from hospital, no meeting took place between the treating psychiatrist and the community psychiatrist; Ryan’s care co-ordinator had moved jobs and not been replaced; and Ryan’s family were not informed of the discharge.
Although evidence was heard to say that the Trust now has a full complement of community psychiatric nurses, it was not clear whether a formal discharge protocol existed or has since been brought into being so that patients are not discharged until contact between professionals and family has been established.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

(1) The lack of a co-ordinated discharge from in-patient psychiatric care into the community, in particular the failure of appropriate professionals from hospital and community to liaise and for family to be informed as a pre-requisite for discharge;
(2) The inability to pre-arrange attendance of an ambulance when police officers exercise a s.135 (1) MHA Act 1983 warrant;
(3) The lack of formality to the ‘briefing’ or risk assessment exercise before officers enter premises with a view to exercising a s.135 (1) MHA Act 1983 warrant."

The investigation concluded on the 4th May 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from natural causes contributed to by complications of an accidental fall, poor nutritional status and complications of necessary medication. The medical cause of death was 1a) Multi-organ failure; 1b) Frailty; II) Multiple Duodenal Ulcers, Fracture left hip with Hemiarthroplasty, Poor Nutritional Status, Systemic Sclerosis","Evelyn Mary Dutton had severe Systemic Sclerosis. She was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital following an accidental fall at her home address. It was identified that she had fractured her neck of femur. She was operated on. Post-operatively her weight was found to be low and she was referred to the dietetics team. Her nutritional status remained compromised and an Nasojejunal (NJ) tube was sited on 21st July 2022. There was a delay in utilising the NJ Tube until 29th July. The NJ feeding was subsequently stopped due to concerns of aspiration and fluid overload. It was restarted on the night of 4th August. There was a significant electrolyte imbalance, probably due to refeeding syndrome due to the issues with nutrition. On 5th August the feeding via the NJ Tube was stopped due to episodes of vomiting of blood from her gastro intestinal issues including duodenal ulcers, identified in a series of gastroscopies, probably caused by steroid treatment. She continued to become increasingly frail. She deteriorated further and died at Stepping Hill Hospital on 13th August 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

1. The inquest heard evidence that after her fall, on 28th June 2022, despite her age and frailty there was a prolonged wait for an ambulance to take her to hospital. This was due to the demands on the ambulance service that day. Once they reached hospital Mrs Dutton had to remain in the ambulance until a space became available for her in the Emergency Department. This was due to the pressure on the Emergency Department and was replicated across Greater Manchester. Once in the Emergency Department she then remained there until transfer to a ward on 29th June when a bed became available;

2. The evidence was that long waits for transfer to hospital and delays in being transferred to wards presented a significant risk to the health and wellbeing of elderly frail patients with hip fractures such as Mrs Dutton. The inquest was told that these delays were not unusual in summer of 2022."

It was heard that once a referral is received into the mental health team those referrals are triaged within 24 hours. Further that based on contractual obligations, referrals must be triaged within 24 hours of receipt. The triage is undertaken by a qualified mental health or learning disability nurse. The outcome of the triage is that when assessment is deemed to be required the patient is referred to primary care (Rethink) or secondary care (TEWV). I heard that a routine assessment should be offered within 4 working days after triage. I did not hear any evidence that would suggest Mr Waddup's assessment was deemed to be urgent. I heard that an urgent referral would take place urgently and within 24 hours with the inmate being kept safe. Mr Waddup was referred to the mental health team at HMP Durham on 29th October 2019 following his recall to prison. His needs were identified as anxiety and depression.

On 12th November 2019 a telephone call handover was provided from primary care in HMP Durham to primary care in HMP Northumberland. This was 13 days/7 working days after triage. I heard the delay in assessment was due to the absence of a staff member. On 14th, 19th and 21st November 2019 attempts were made to assess Mr Waddup in his cell by telephone.

The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative verdict namely that the deceased had suspended himself by a ligature from a bannister railing at his home address on 3rd March 2012 but the question of intent remains unclear. The medical cause of death was asphyxia by hanging.,"(1) Mr Bonsall had joined the Army at the age of 17 and had served in Afghanistan. During his tour of Afghanistan he witnessed the death of a close friend.
(2) An army psychiatrist subsequently deemed Mr Bonsall temperamentally unsuitable for service. He was discharged from the Army in September 2007.
(3) Mr Bonsall continued to suffer from depression. He relocated to West Wales and registered with a surgery in 2010. After an assessment he was prescribed citalopram. He later renewed his prescription which his GP put on repeat prescription. This is contrary to good practice guidelines.
(4) His GP considered counselling as an alternative to citalopram but did not refer Mr Bonsall for psychotherapy as there was a ten month waiting list.
(5) Mr Bonsall was found hanging from a bannister rail at his home address by his wife on 3rd March 2012.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

(1) That citalopram was given on repeat prescription which is contrary to guidelines. It may well be that awareness of these guidelines needs to be raised to ensure that GPs are aware that citalopram should not be given on

(2) The ten month waiting times for psychotherapy effectively means that this is not a viable alternative to anti-depressant medication and it might well be that a review of these waiting times is appropriate."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 October 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was Accidental death. I determined that at about 14.00 on 24 May 2017 Gordon Penistan was unsettled by a loud noise at Otterbourne Grange Residential Home in Otterbourne and went from the dining room to a staircase in the home and then sustained an unwitnessed fall as a result of which he suffered an injury to his head. Mr Penistan suffered from dementia and was disorientated, having just moved to the home and he was being treated with anticoagulation therapy. He died as a result of 1a Subdural Haematoma 1b Trauma to the Head","Gordon Penistan was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy which affected his visual perception as well as vascular dementia. He lacked mental capacity and in February 2017 he moved to a residential home capable of supporting dementia sufferers where he settled after some initial issues of aggression. The cost of the home was depleting his funds and so his family applied for local authority funding which was agreed, but Hampshire Adults' Health and Care insisted that Mr Penistan should be moved to a less expensive home that could meet his needs. From April 2017 responsibility for placement had passed to a newly formed brokerage team who lacked experience in dealing with such referrals. There was no ""best interests"" meeting and a lack of adequate communication with the case worker and with the family. No consideration was given to renegotiating terms with the existing care home or to the effects of a move on Mr Penistan in light of his condition. In consequence of this death Hampshire County Council instigated a Critical Incident Review as a result of which it has made improvements to the brokerage process by introducing prior senior management authorisation and further training of the brokerage team. In addition it is in the process of issuing guidance both for staff and for families about moving from self funding to local authority funding.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group,On 25/10/2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anthony John William Watson. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 29/01/19. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide.,"The Deceased was diagnosed with recurrent depression and anxiety in early 2017 and was being treated by mental health services. In mid-May his mental health declined quickly and by 18/10/18 he was displaying signs of psychosis, and reporting that he was thinking of taking his own life by jumping from a height. Mental health services felt that an immediate admission was necessary, but no bed was available within the area, and he was placed on a waiting list. To mitigate the risk of the Deceased harming himself whilst awaiting a bed, he was referred to community mental health services who visited him at home on 18, 19 and 20. A visit was planned for the afternoon on 21/10/18. On the morning of 21/10/18 the Deceased was at home and in his first floor bedroom, he cut both wrists and his neck, and jumped through an open window, landing on the patio causing a significant head injury. He had left a note indicating an intention to end his own life. He was taken by paramedics to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. A CT-scan revealed the fall from height caused an unsurvivable right-sided subdural haemorrhage. He died at 14:26hrs on 22/10/18.

Based on information from the Deceased's treating clinicians the medical cause of death was determined to be:
1a. CATASTROPHIC HEAD INJURY
1b. FALL FROM HEIGHT
2. POLYTRAUMA","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. Mr Watson was aged 72. The Community Mental Health Team advised on 18/10/18 that he required an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment for his own safety. However, this could not happen as no bed was available within the area. Three days later there was still no bed available. Mr Watson was not offered a bed out-of-area.
2. This report has similar themes to the 7 reports issued by the Birmingham and Solihull Coroners on 4/10/18.
3. However, the impact of Mr Watson's age is a new issue.
4. I heard evidence that:
  a. Younger and older adults will not normally be admitted as inpatients on mixed units. Beds on young adult units may have been available on 18-22 October 2018 but these were not considered.
  b. Beds in neighbouring areas are unavailable because of contractual issues. The closest out of area option is at least 70 miles away. Although Mr Watson was not offered an out of area bed, his wife was confident that had one been offered he would have declined because 70 miles was so far away. Whilst this distance is likely to deter a patient of any age from accepting the offer, it is particularly problematic for elderly patients and their families.
  c. Whilst remedial action is underway in response to the concerns raised in the 7 reports issued on 4/10/18, currently it still remains the position that at least one patient every day in Birmingham and Solihull is advised they require an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment but no bed is available within the area.
5. The lack of inpatient beds is a resource issue. My ongoing concerns are that (a) there are insufficient numbers of beds in Birmingham and Solihull, and (b) out-of-area beds are too far away."

2. Parents of the late Kinga Cieciorska.","On 11 March 2016, I commenced an investigation into the death of the child, Kinga Cieciorska. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 June 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was the deceased died by way of natural causes contributed to by neglect. The cause of death was:

1a) Peritonitis
1b) Perforated gastric ulcer
2) Cerebral Palsy","1. Kinga was a 16 year old girl born with a number of complex medical needs including cerebral palsy, scoliosis, and dislocated right hip and was visually impaired. She was on various medications including Diclofenac and one of the recognised side effects is stomach ulcers.

2. Her parents became concerned and she appeared to be in pain and discomfort with her abdomen becoming distended. The family took her to her GP and he advised that she should be admitted to Hospital for checks. She was subsequently taken to Walsall Manor Hospital. He also sent notes of his examination and background medical history for the Hospital to use to assist in any diagnosis. It transpired during the inquest that these notes provided by the GP were not seen by the Junior Doctor or Triage Nurse who initially examined her when she arrived.

3. The Junior Doctor after examination recorded that her abdomen was soft and tender. The family asked for an ultrasound scan but this wasn’t considered necessary and the working diagnosis was constipation. The Junior Doctor discussed the case with his supervising Consultant, and he advised that an ECG be performed and that further advice should be sought from the on call Paediatrician. The ECG revealed sinus tachycardia.

4. The Junior Doctor didn’t record the name of the Paediatrician he spoke to but says he was advised there was no problem or concerns in relation to the tachycardia and she could be discharged with Movicol medication for constipation.

5. The Paediatrician identified by the rota provided a statement denying he had given any advice in relation to the patient and couldn’t recollect any conversation with the Junior Doctor.

6. Kinga was discharged home. Her condition deteriorated rapidly overnight and she became unresponsive. She was urgently taken back to Hospital in her father’s car on the morning of the 11 March. Sadly, despite resuscitation attempts she couldn’t be revived and had passed away.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –

1. Evidence emerged during the inquest that the abnormal ECG trace and tachycardia needed further investigation and she should have been subject to further tests and admitted for further observation to establish the cause of the tachycardia. This was effectively a missed opportunity to render basic medical care. On the balance of probability it is more likely than not, she may have survived or life may have been extended if tests had been done to confirm the diagnosis of peritonitis and appropriate treatment commenced.

2. During the inquest it emerged there was evidence of systemic failings in recording of and transmission of information. The Junior Doctor failed to record the name of the Specialist Paediatric Registrar giving advice. More worryingly the Paediatric Registrar at inquest could not recollect giving any advice in relation to the patient. It also emerged during the inquest that medical notes provided by the GP were given to reception staff by the parents on admission. Unfortunately these documents were not forwarded or seen by the Junior Doctor on examination of the patient.

3. It also emerged during the inquest that details of her medication including the significance of the drug, Diclofenac was not considered. One of the contraindications of this drug for long term users is gastric ulcers. Many people take NSAIDs without having any side effects, but there's always a risk the medication could cause problems, such as stomach ulcers, particularly if taken for a long time or at high doses."

""On 23 September 2018 Zona Ethel Tebbs sustained a garden injury for which she sought medical advice the following day. Failure to provide immunoglobulin on 24th September exposed her to a greater risk of developing tetanus and thus exposed her to a greater risk of death.

On the 23rd September 2018 she Sustained a minor injury to her shin from a garden pick. The following day she attended her general practitioner where the wound was dressed and she was given the tetanus vaccination. On the 2nd October she was sufficiently unwell that an ambulance was called and she was taken to Doncaster Royal Infirmary. She was displaying early signs of tetanus but it was not diagnosed at the time and she was discharged. She returned to hospital by ambulance on the 3rd October where tetanus was raised but felt to be unlikely on the basis that this was a very rare condition and other differential diagnoses were being explored. It is clear however that the clinical signs were consistent with tetanus. One of the witnesses from the hospital told me that he was reassured by the fact that Mrs Tebbs had been given the tetanus vaccination by her GP. On the 4th October her symptoms had worsened, tetanus was diagnosed and treatment commenced. Following the diagnosis there was consultation with the Infectious Diseases Unit at the Sheffield Trust and further research undertaken into the condition. As a result of these various enquiries it was established that Mrs Tebbs needed immunoglobulin which was administered to her the same day.

During the course of the admission the spasms improved but she was suffering from muscle stamina and following an MRI a diagnosis of likely acute on chronic myelopathy with recovery considered extremely unlikely. Mrs Tebbs passed away on the 5th November 2018.

The investigation progressed to an inquest which I conducted between the 14th and 16th December, 2020. I made a determination at the conclusion of the inquest that Mr Harichandra had died as a result of cardio respiratory failure and that a fall from a wheelchair on the 5th December 2019 was the precipitating cause of his death.","On 5th December 2019, Mr Harichandra, whilst in hospital, fell out of his own electric wheelchair and struck the floor.

He was a long standing quadriplegic with a brittle spine. He had recently been placed in that wheelchair by hospital staff but not strapped in. He toppled forwards because he was sitting upright in the chair and not sitting leaning back into the chair.

A hospital CT scan carried out on the same day revealed a clear and obvious fracture to his neck at C4/5 and a posterior displacement of the spine at the fracture site. That injury was caused by the fall.

There was an error in the reporting of that CT scan by hospital staff such that the report which accompanied the scan images indicated there was no fracture.

As a result Mr Harichandra was not accepted to the local spinal trauma centre hospital, where it is likely that an operation to stabilise the fracture would have been carried out had the CT scan been correctly reported.

The precipitating cause of his death was the neck fracture sustained in the fall on 5th December 2019.","During the course of the inquest, the following evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

Evidence was given by medical staff from the Royal Free Hospital and other medical experts that:

1. There was an error in the reporting of the CT scan by the original clinician.

2. That error was not noticed when the CT scan was (or should have been) reviewed by a Consultant Radiologist.

3. The staff who moved Mr Harichandra to his wheelchair on the 5th December 2019 were not aware of his pre-existing spinal condition in particular his brittle spine. They did not make reference to the Falls Assessment Tool. Furthermore, that document was incomplete as it did not highlight his spinal condition and lack of mobility.

4. The staff who moved Mr Harichandra did not examine his wheelchair for a belt which would have kept him secure. They were unaware that such a device existed and as a result, did not consider whether it should be used.

5. Mr Harichandra suffered a severe adverse reaction to the use of a Naso-Gastric tube on the 19th December, 2019 which was closely associated with terminal events. This fact was not recorded by hospital staff as it should have been.

I am concerned that:

(a) The error by the original clinician who interpreted the CT scan images of 5th December 2019 has not been properly explained.

(b) The Consultant Radiologist who reviewed the CT scan images of the 5th December 2019 should have noticed the clear and obvious neck fracture. Although there were 2 scans of the 5th December 2019 to review, it appeared that the clinician most probably reviewed only one of them. There ought to be a system in place which ensures that a scan review can only be completed if all the scans taken are reviewed by a second clinician.

(c) The Falls Assessment Tool was not properly completed or reviewed by staff;

(d) Hospital staff have no training in how to assess and deal with private equipment brought from outside such as an electric wheelchair and the safety features of such devices;

(e) By hospital staff not recording Mr Harichandra's adverse reaction to the Naso-Gastric tube insertion, future clinicians would have been unaware of this severe reaction when treating him and considering how his important nutritional needs should be met had he survived."

During admission developed a gastrointestinal bleed related to mucositis. She had multiple blood transfusions and investigations. She recovered initially however had further gastrointestinal bleed on 18th August 2023. She was certified as having died at 04.05 on the 21st August 2023. It is more likely than not that her severe reaction to the treatment was such that stopping the treatment was unlikely to have prevented her death.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17th April 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that Robert Watt died of 1a. Carcinomatosis 1b. Carcinoma bladder 2. Carcinoma Prostate at Wisdom Hospice on 25th October 2014 from a bladder cancer which at the time of diagnosis was too advanced to treat. The conclusion was that he died of natural causes.","Robert Watt had a PMH which included chronic kidney disease and prostate cancer. He was under the care of the renal unit at Kent and Canterbury Hospital and the urology unit at Medway Maritime Hospital. In November 2013 he was discharged back to primary care as his prostate cancer was stable. In May 2014 Mr. Watt was referred by his GP through the rapid access protocol to a haematuria clinic run by Medway NHS Foundation Trust. He was to undergo a cystoscopy which did not go ahead. A letter from the clinic to his GP indicates that the reason for this was that Mr. Watt had been in contact requesting to be removed from the waiting list. His wife has no recollection of this having happened nor did they receive a copy of the letter. An investigation revealed that these matters being dealt with by admin staff, the importance of attending the clinic would not have been discussed with Mr. Watt. Although the fact of non-attendance was recorded electronically, a copy of the letter was not placed with Mr. Watt's medical notes, thus when he subsequently attended a urology review, the registrar was not aware of the non-attendance. Had he been aware, the haematuria would have been investigated and on the balance of probabilities he would not have died when he did. On 14th September 2014 Mr. Watt was admitted to Medway Maritime Hospital with weight loss and rectal bleeding. He remained an inpatient for 8 days. During that time although a malignancy was suspected the limited investigations that took place did not reveal the cause of his symptoms. A CT with contrast was not carried out as a renal specialist had advised against it given poor kidney function, but a CT without contrast was not undertaken which the consultant accepted should have been. A urologist was consulted because of haematuria but this was left to a FY1 doctor. An on-call urologist was not asked to review Mr. Watt who was discharged on 22nd September 2014 without a diagnosis for further investigations to be carried out as an outpatient. It was accepted by the consultant urologist that matters should not have progressed in this way. The fact that Mr. Watt had a high grade advanced bladder cancer was diagnosed by CT following an admission on 26th September 2014 to Kent and Canterbury Hospital when Mr. Watt's wife sought an alternative opinion. Although Mr. Watt underwent a TURB the cancer was incurable and he died on 25th October 2014","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
	i. No party explained the importance of attendance at the haematuria clinic to Mr. Watt or his wife
	ii. The letter communicating the cancellation of the clinic was not sent to the deceased, nor was it placed on the medical records
	iii. There is no documentation relating to the referral to urology and forward management of the haematuria within the medical records
	iv. On each occasion that the medical team consulted with renal or urological physicians in seeking advice how to manage their patient, the consultation was conducted through the most junior doctor on the ward (FY1)
	v. A urologist was not asked to review Mr. Watt in circumstances where a malignancy was suspected and he was suffering from weight loss and haematuria both of which are recognised symptoms associated with bladder cancer
	vi. The evidence has shown (although it does not relate to the death) that Mr. Watt was discharged from the hospital even though he was scheduled to have an OGD at the hospital on the date of discharge, which it appears that the physicians were unaware of."

The inquest has not yet completed.","Anthony Binfield died as a result of ligature asphyxiation inside his cell on H wing, Houseblock 2, at HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire, at 22.19 hours on Monday 6 March 2023.

At 21.23 hours, while undertaking an NPS log check, a prison officer found that Anthony had covered his cell observation panel from the inside. Contrary to the expected policy and guidance in place at the time, the officer left the cell after gaining no response to knocking and returned to the office to collect the inundation unit key. He returned to Anthony's cell and attempted to remove the inundation unit from the door but was unable to do so. He returned to the office again and arranged for a member of the security team to assist him with removing the inundation unit. Eventually, after 11 minutes, the obstruction was moved by officers via the inundation hole, whereupon they discovered Anthony was hanging from a ligature. He could not be resuscitated.

There was an 11-minute delay between prison staff learning Anthony was unresponsive to knocking and banging, and subsequently entering his cell. This delay is unacceptable and contrary to local policy and guidance. It will be for the jury to determine whether this delay probably more than minimally contributed to his death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  –

(1) Prison staff failing to manage the covering of cell observation panels in a safe way that is compliant with the policy and guidance issued by the prison over many years.

I am taking the exceptional step of writing to you formally before the conclusion of the inquest as I am so concerned by the evidence called to date regarding the custom and practice of officers when discovering obscured cell observation panels at night.

There is a dangerous culture of staff assuming the prisoner has obscured the observation panel for privacy purposes or as a form of protest against the regime. This neglects the obvious and very real risk that the prisoner is seeking to harm themselves, without detection. The HMPPS Safety Nudge, issued in February 2018, made clear that cell observation panels are a vital tool in keeping prisoners safe and must be kept clear at all times in order to preserve life.

The custom and practice of seeking to visualise the prisoner via the inundation unit hole (and other means, such as the side of the door) has developed over time and is now an embedded culture accepted by many officers as a response to this occurrence. This practice leads to delay in entering the cell, risks lives and is contrary to policy.

This is not a new issue for the prison and hence my concern that the prison has failed to tackle this issue over many years. In August 2020, a prisoner died at HMP Lowdham Grange as a result of drug use. When officers conducted a welfare check they found his cell observation panel to be obscured. Contrary to policy and guidance, Prison staff delayed entering the cell while they fetched the inundation unit key to attempt to observe inside the cell. The Prison and Probation Ombudsman made a recommendation to the Prison Director that they should ensure that observation panels are kept clear, and that staff actively challenge prisoners who cover them. In response, the Prison Director issued a notice to staff in January 2021 reminding staff of the need to treat any prisoner as unresponsive if they fail to acknowledge the officer, and to call a code blue. A similar notice was issued in April 2021, reminding staff of the need to perform a dynamic risk assessment and enter the cell in a quick and safe manner when there is no response to asking the prisoner to remove the offending item. The notice was re-issued in November 2021, and after the inquest in approximately April 2023.

Despite these multiple notices, a number of witnesses who remain members of staff at the prison (now under HMPPS employ) reported being unaware of the expected procedure when faced with an obscured cell observation panel until attending Anthony's inquest in December 2024. It is clear that the issuing of staff notices has not addressed the problem of prisoners covering their cell hatches, nor the unsafe custom and practice of staff leaving the cell and thereby delaying safe entry."

1 a Multiple injuries due to impact of fall

The conclusion was one of SUICIDE.

In paragraph 3 of the Record of Inquest where when and in what circumstances Adam came by his death the jury stated as follows:

Adam James Carter died on 10 September 2017. The time of Adam's death was recorded at 19.03 hours, at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. Adam suffered multiple injuries as a result of falling from the 5th floor of Talbot Road car park in Blackpool. Prior to this event, Adam had absconded from the Harbour Mental Health facility during escorted leave. Adam was under treatment at the harbour for bi polar affective disorder. He was suffering from mania on admission and appeared to be responding to treatment. As the mania was largely under control from mid August onwards. Prior to absconding, Adam appeared settled and there was no evidence to suggest that Adam would abscond. He had previously been on 9 periods of escorted leave without incident, and he had not expressed any self harm or suicidal ideation in that period. It is likely that Adam asked a member of the public to call an ambulance on Church Street and identified himself as a patient at the Harbour at 17.45 hours, prior to making his way to the 5th floor of the car park where the event took place.
We conclude that alcohol and substance abuse played no causal role in his death or the events leading to it.","Adam Carter was confirmed a 1903 hours on 10 September 2017 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital having been transferred there after having reportedly fallen from the 5th floor of a multi-story car park in Blackpool town centre at around 1755 hours earlier that afternoon.

Some two hours previously Adam had absconded from The Harbour mental health facility in Blackpool as he commenced a period of escorted leave with a member of staff - that leave had been granted on the basis that he could leave the building with the staff member but not go beyond the hospital grounds perimeter. In fact CCTV footage showed him running off through the doors of the building and initially being pursued by the staff member who quickly altered other staff and police were contacted.

Between Adam making off from The Harbour and the reported fall from a car park there were no sightings of Adam. The only evidence available was that a member of the public rang the ambulance service at re that a call had been made to the ambulance service from Church Street in Blackpool at 17.45 hours that day informing a man had approached him and asked he call for an ambulance but that upon him doing so the person had walked off but after informing him that he had absconded from The Harbour and was a ""mental patient"".

There is no further reported sighting of Adam until shortly before 6pm when eyewitness reported seeing Adam's body falling to the pavement and one witness had been on the top floor of the car park when he saw Adam at the top of the car park climb over a fence and drop himself over the edge.

A subsequent post mortem examination confirmed Adam had died from multiple injuries as a result of impact trauma.

Adam had a history of involvement with mental health services from approximately 2000. His parents with whom he lived had noticed deterioration in his condition from 12th July 2017. That deterioration continued and he was detained under section 2 Mental Health Act 1983 for a period of assessment [and later detained under section 3 of that Act]. Initially detained in a mental health ward in Blackburn he was transferred to The Harbour before the end of July 2017. His therapeutic team felt his condition improved and by mid-August 2017 he began to utilise escorted ground leave and plans were being put in place form him to be discharged to a supported living placement close to his parents' home.

Adam was known to have expressed suicidal thoughts previously but it was not felt that he had tried to actively harm himself previously.

By 30th August 2017 the therapeutic team felt he was settled, there was no evidence of psychosis, and he had used his periods of leave without difficulty, and on 4th September 2017 he was ""stepped down"" from a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit [PICU] to an acute hospital ward.

An independent Consultant Psychiatrist provided an independent opinion upon the care afforded to Adam and amongst his conclusions he reported that Adam had suffered a relapse into severe mania in July 2017, that his care and treatment was of an acceptable standard, that his mania had been largely controlled by mid-August 2017; that the team had taken sensible and appropriate measures to manage the risk of self - injury, that it was reasonable to assume the risk of completed suicide and of Adam absconding was low and that in his view Adam's death could not have been predicted by his Multi-Disciplinary team.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows:

The concern relates to record keeping.

During his independent review of this matter, a Consultant Psychiatrist identified some discrepancies within the medical records including the following:

 Although he felt that the therapeutic team had an understanding of the extent to which Adam posed a risk of:

- aggression and violence;
- self harm;
- suicidal behaviour;
- absconding;

He did not feel that these risks were documented or clearly formulated in the medical notes.

 He stated that there was very little detail in the documentation as regards Adam's use of his leave nor of care planning of his leave. The rationale for leave having been granted was not recorded nor were the benefits and risks associated with leave.

 He was unable to find a record of an assessment of Adam's clinical state by nursing staff immediately before the period of escorted ground leave on 10th September 2017 as required by trust policy [although he did not feel that this would have any bearing on the decision to afford Adam leave on this occasion].

 He could not find a copy of the Leave Authorisation that granted Adam leave and felt that documentation of leave fell short of the guidance laid out in the Trust policy for the authorisation of section 17 leave of absence.

Clearly the quality of record keeping is important in the context of a detained mental health patient. Adam had spent some time in a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit and then a number of days on an acute inpatient ward prior to the events of 10th September 2017.

The level of risk such a patient poses as regards issues such as the risk of self harm and absconding are fundamental to the care provided. Plans were being made for Adam to be discharged and into the community rather than back to his parents' home and he was being afforded the opportunity to build towards that discharge by granting him leave which was an important step in progressing towards that goal. However, such decisions need to be made appropriately and informed by how the risk a patient poses is viewed at that time. It is vital that the basis for such decisions is clear from the records.

If this does not happen then I have a concern that future deaths may result - inevitably patients such as Adam are cared for by a team consisting of different staff performing different shifts. Staff taking over the care of a patient such as Adam ought not to have to rely on the verbal information provided to them at a handover of that patient's care but need to have the opportunity to read the records and to remind themselves how the risk their patient poses is viewed by for example the relevant Consultant Psychiatrist, and why he or she has been granted leave.

The court heard that escorted grounds leave was granted to Adam but that nursing staff had discretion as regards whether that leave went ahead and they may exercise such discretion subject to how Adam presented, his behaviour on the ward etc. If they cannot access accurate and informative records, such staff may make decisions that are not in the interests of their patients. Leave may proceed on a basis not felt to be safe. Leave may be declined because the staff member - unable to access the relevant information - decides to err on the side of caution and declines leave to the detriment of that patient's progress and the condition of his / her mental health.

It seems to me that if an independent consultant psychiatrist has conducted a review and identified these issues in relation to records it should inevitably prompt a concern on my part that unless I write a report such as this one future deaths may result.

I therefore raise the concern. I cannot be prescriptive about what action should be taken and I make no recommendations but simply raise the issue.

At the conclusion of the inquest, I indicated to the Properly Interested Persons that I proposed to write to the Department of Health by way of a report in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009."

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 17 August 2023. The conclusion of the Inquest was a Narrative in which the medical cause of death was 1a Serotonin Syndrome, 1b MDMA intoxication. David Celino, aged 16, was sold [REDACTED] tablets [REDACTED] at the Leeds Festival in August 2022. Shortly after taking [REDACTED] tablets, he developed symptoms. Despite prompt treatment, at the festival's field hospital and in a hospital ICU, he could not be revived.","In August 2022, large numbers of people under the age of 18 were permitted to attend the three day outdoor music event known as the Leeds Festival. This admission policy was accepted by the Leeds City Council who licence the festival and had a statutory duty to protect children from harm and prevent crime.

The 2022 Crime Plan prepared by West Yorkshire Police acknowledged that the festival was targeted by gangs of criminals who seek to profit by supplying drugs to those attending. It was further acknowledged in this plan that young people under the age of 18 are likely to be naïve to the risks relating to illicit drugs and hence, vulnerable to exploitation.

David J Celino and his 5 friends were in this potentially vulnerable group. They had little experience of illicit drugs. They were attending a music festival for the first time without adult supervision. They were excited, having just received their GCSE results on Thursday 25 August 2022. Their parents did not have sufficient information about the availability of and/or use of drugs at the festival to make an informed assessment of the risk to their sons.

David Celino bought three tablets from a drug dealer, represented to be [REDACTED]. He had no information concerning the composition of the tablets, their strength, the max dose to take (if such exists), nor the symptoms indicating an adverse reaction which should highlight the need to obtain urgent medical help.

He probably took [REDACTED] tablets and began to exhibit signs of an adverse reaction within the hour. He walked around the festival site for approximately 90 minutes before collapsing and being taken to the onsite field hospital. The skilled clinicians there realised his condition may prove fatal and so after initial treatment, expedited his transfer to hospital, where he died early the next morning.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths may occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) Neither the organiser of the festival (Festival Republic) nor Leeds City Council which licenced the event had accurate information about the number of people under 18 who were attending the festival. It was estimated to be 20% of the 90,000 attending, so about 18,000. In consequence, the magnitude of the problem of potentially vulnerable, naïve teenagers exposed to possible exploitation by drug dealers, was not appreciated.

(2) It was said in the course of the evidence that some 4-5 people die annually from illicit drug related causes at the various music festivals held in Britain. It is understood that there is no governing body with oversight of music festivals and hence no record of drug related casualties, which might reveal the extent of the problem.

(3) Without reliable numbers, it is not possible to interrogate the data or establish what proportion of the drug related casualties belong to the under 18 cohort of attendees. National oversight would enable comparisons to be made between different festivals and their respective demographics, as well as providing useful information as to the breadth and depth of the drug problem at different events. This in turn is likely to assist in an assessment of the effectiveness of control measures to prevent (or at least restrict) illegal drugs being brought onto festival sites.

(4) The history of drug related deaths amongst teenagers at the Leeds Festival in recent years has prompted the organiser to explore a greater emphasis on deterrent measures since the 2022 festival. Unless there is a hydra headed campaign to deter illicit drugs being brought onto the festival site, I fear further deaths will occur in circumstances comparable to David Celino's tragic death (whether involving under 18s or other age groups) in Leeds or elsewhere. There is a need to review the way sources of intelligence are harnessed and the enforcement action to be taken against anyone supplying illicit drugs, in order to convey the organiser's determination to create a hostile environment (acting in concert with both its private security personnel and West Yorkshire Police).

(5) Evidence at the inquest indicated David Celino had walked about the Leeds Festival site between approximately 7pm and 8.45pm on the evening of Saturday 27 August 2022. As the signs of his adverse drug reaction developed, he was unable to walk straight, was pale, sweating profusely and agitated. In the latter stages he needed help from two other 16-year-olds to prevent him falling over. In this period, he passed through at least one check point manned by stewards or security staff. It is likely he encountered other festival staff and/or volunteers in this period also. Lamentably, no staff or volunteers spotted the need to intervene to ask about his well-being or offer assistance. This history suggests further instruction or training for festival staff and volunteers is required as to the need to be proactive, particularly in view of the prevalence of illicit drugs and teenagers. As it was, David Celino's friends only obtained advice as to his condition from the drug dealer they happened to encounter, who reassured them that his reaction as ""normal"".

(6) Various witnesses raised the issue of ""Front of House"" drug testing, expressing views as to the benefits and disadvantages of this being permitted. It would help all those involved in the management of events similar to the Leeds Festival to have authoritative guidance on this subject, from the Home Office, along with clarification as to exactly what is permitted."

The conclusion of the Inquest was a narrative conclusion based upon a cause of death of 1a Radiation-induced neuropathy 1b Radiotherapy for tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma 2 Ischaemic heart disease.

Mr Schmidt had participated in a clinical trial known as 'Compare' in which he was treated with an accelerated radiotherapy and chemotherapy in March/April 2018.

He was diagnosed with cancer of the tonsils in January 2018 and underwent tonsillectomy. He agreed to participate in a clinical trial involving accelerated radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The treatment programme was completed in April 2018. In October he developed neurological symptoms in the area near to the site of his radiotherapy. He was admitted to hospital on 8 November 2018. Post mortem investigations by a consultant neuropathologist and a consultant histopathologist concluded that, on the balance of probability, radiotherapy-induced nerve injury was the likely cause of his death.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(2) The mechanism by which the radiotherapy/chemotherapy treatment probably causes injury needs to be further investigated to establish whether this occurs directly or indirectly by affecting the immune system."

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.",[REDACTED] was found deceased [REDACTED]. She was found [REDACTED] [REDACTED] had mental health issues starting from around 15 to 16 years of age. They resulted in self-harm and 2 suicide attempts the last of which was in September 2017. Mental health care had been provided to [REDACTED] both before and after her 18th birthday [REDACTED]. She was in contact with mental health services up until the evening of the 30th April 2018 before she killed herself the next morning.,"On the evidence various issues were addressed and set out in the coroner's determination and findings and can be referred to for wider reading. Two specific issues arose which could not be said to have caused or contributed to [REDACTED] death but could in others.

1 Delay in IAPT counselling

a) After [REDACTED] turned 18 she moved to adult mental health services. She had parallel contact with her GP surgery [REDACTED]. Shortly before [REDACTED] 18th birthday, according to the MPFT clinical review (page 9 of 33), [REDACTED] was referred to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) by the [REDACTED] Access Team for assessment for psychological therapy or counselling. On the 14th November 2017 (page 12 of 33) it was agreed with [REDACTED] to add her to her GP surgery waiting list for counselling in line with her treatment preference. [REDACTED] remained on the IAPT waiting list for counselling at the time of her death.

b) The evidence at the inquest was that a 3 month time interval would be optimal but in [REDACTED] case, in relation to this GP surgery, 10 months would be the norm. Such a delay is sub-optimal and could have an adverse effect on a patient waiting for counselling to commence.

2. Risk assessment and progress notes.

a) The electronic records were hard for a lay person to follow or understand particularly when said to have been updated or validated with the potential for original entries to have been overwritten (as opposed to amended or deleted). If the user of the system understands it then that does not make it unfit for purpose but it was not clear how a user would readily see what had originally been written.

b) This is distinct from progress notes and/or risk assessments being accurately recorded. It was not clear when and how often risk assessments should be updated and how and when they would be read in conjunction with the progress notes. Were risk assessments intended to be summaries if a user did not have time to read all the progress notes? What function were they intended to serve? Consideration should be given as to whether the system can be improved."

I concluded the Inquest on 17 December 2014 at Oxford Coroner's Court. A copy of the Record of Inquest is attached. It will be seen that I gave a conclusion of 'Accident' and made the following findings:

Kevin Lawrenson was driving his works van at approximately 18.55 hours on 18 June 2014 Southbound on the M40 Motorway between Junction 6 towards Junction 5 at Lewknor near Stokenchurch, Oxfordshire when he collided with the rear of a slow moving lorry in lane 1 on an incline uphill.

There was oral evidence at the Inquest from 4 witnesses. This included the Police Collision Investigator and [REDACTED] from the Traffic Management Unit of Hampshire Constabulary/ Thames Valley Police Roads Policing. Additionally, I arranged for a representative from the Highways Agency to attend and give evidence. Mr Michael Freeman, Departments Representative, based at Bedford, gave evidence. My office provided the Highways Agency with a copy of the Inquest file prior to the hearing. Consequently, I have not provided you with a copy of the file with this letter but I do attach a copy of the report of [REDACTED] Collision Investigator, and the report prepared by [REDACTED] dated 31 July 2014.",The circumstances are briefly set out above but are explained in more detail in the report of the Collision Investigator. Mr Lawrenson drove into the rear of a Romanian HGV as it drove very slowly (22mph according to the Tachograph) uphill in lane 1 of the M40. The collision occurred just past Junction 6. The HGV was loaded with 23 tonnes of bricks. It was not overladen however. It is understood that the HGV was initially driving behind a recovery vehicle which was towing a vehicle and that this is also partly the reason why the HGV was driving so slowly.,"During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make this report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are in relation to slow moving vehicles at the location, signage and steps that may be possible to reduce the likelihood of a similar accident occurring in future.

It will be seen from paragraph 2.3 of [REDACTED] report that there have been a large number of similar accidents at or near this location, including 3 fatalities since 2008. It will also be seen from paragraph 3.1.1 that there are two signs prior to the location of the scene warning of slow moving vehicles. On page 10 of [REDACTED] report there is a photograph of the first of the 2 signs. It does not appear to be a very large sign; it is sited quite low down.

I heard oral evidence from Mr [REDACTED] about the system of monitoring and reporting in place and that, as recommended in the 2013 Safety Monitoring Report prepared on behalf of UK Highways Limited, a further study between junction 5 to 6 has been undertaken and a report is due to be completed very shortly. it is understood that the report is likely to outline possible improvements to signage and other steps. For example, there is the potential of increasing signage and/ or making the additional signs more visible. I was told there was insufficient room in the central reservation to place a sign. I understand chevrons for lane separation is a possibility, as is an electronic sign which detects slow moving vehicles and warns other motorists. I appreciate of course that there will be considerations around the issue of funding if improvements are to be implemented."

1. The Inquest heard that under the NICE guidance where a patient needs an operation for a hip fracture such as in Mrs Warwick's case and needs optimising, that optimisation should be dealt with expeditiously. In Mrs Warwick's case she needed cardiology assessment. That delay was due in part to a shortage of cardiologists at the trust exacerbated in particular by a lack of cover by cardiologists over weekends and OOH. The Inquest heard that there was no facility for a patient such as Mrs Warwick to be assessed by cardiology over the weekend;
2. Even after the assessment the Inquest heard evidence that there was a further delay due to a shortage of theatre capacity at the Trust.
3. The delay was further compounded by a shortage of HDU beds at the Trust. The Inquest heard that the Trust was trying to manage this but this shortage was part of a national shortage of HDU beds."

4. Other medical professionals are also likely to be unaware.
5. The Royal Hallamshire Hospital received the results of a urine test on the 20.4.19 but did not act upon them as the patient had been discharged.
6. The evidence was that had the patient received the medication prescribed by the GP or indicated by the hospital results, then she would not have died when she did.
7. There is the potential for wide learning from this tragic case."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14th October 2014.

The conclusion of the inquest was Natural causes.

Elsie Plumb died at 08:30 hours on 15th April 2014 at the Royal United hospital, Combe Park, Bath, due to sepsis.

The medical cause of death was recorded as 1a Group B Streptococcal Septicaemia",Elsie Plumb was born full term. Her mother during the ante-natal period was confirmed as positive for Group B beta haemolytic streptococcus and it was recorded in the notes that she would therefore need antibiotic cover in labour. This did not happen due to the nature of the labour and delivery. Sadly Elsie Plumb died within an hour of delivery due to early onset of early neonatal sepsis due to the Group B streptococcal infection.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  -

The consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist gave evidence and indicated that changes had taken place at the hospital to clarify guidance in relation to administering antibiotics to the mother, and when this should be done.

He indicated that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Green-top Guideline No. 36 titled ""The Prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease"" at paragraph 5.4 on page 4 could be more clearly written.

He stated that the sentence currently reads ""If GBS colonisation was identified earlier in the pregnancy (by a swab taken for other reasons) immediate induction of labour and IAP should be offered""

He suggests that this sentence would be clearer if it were written as follows:

""...immediate induction should be offered. IAP should also be offered, whether or not immediate induction is performed."""

The concern is whether sufficient resources are available in this area."
