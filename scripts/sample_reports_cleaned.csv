Osborne,Milton Keynes,Milton Keynes Urgent Care Service,"On 18 September 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jordan Michael BABB aged 31. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Narrative Conclusion

The deceased died of a pulmonary embolism which was not recognised or treated despite presenting with abnormal clinical observations suggestive of this condition. The decision to discharge the deceased without further investigation or escalation of care contributed to his death.",The deceased had been complaining of chest pain and had visited the Urgent Care Centre in Milton Keynes on 13 September 2024. He was assessed and put on a nebuliser for his asthma. He was discharged with a follow up GP appointment. He was not investigated for a possible pulmonary embolism. On 16 September 2024 he collapsed and despite resuscitation died of a pulmonary embolism at [REDACTED].,"1. Failure to escalate abnormal observations
Despite the patient presenting with a significantly elevated heart rate, high respiratory rate, and reduced oxygen saturations — all indicative of physiological instability — there was no escalation to secondary care or referral to the emergency department. There appears to have been no formal threshold or protocol in place to ensure that abnormal observations of this nature trigger an urgent clinical response.

2. Lack of structured risk assessment for pulmonary embolism
Although pulmonary embolism was a relevant clinical possibility, no structured risk assessment tool (such as the Wells score) was used or documented, and there was no attempt to apply an evidence-based diagnostic pathway as recommended by NICE guidance (NG158).

3. Unclear use or misunderstanding of clinical decision tools
Evidence suggested uncertainty about the appropriate use of the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) in primary care settings, with potential misapplication outside of the specific context recommended by NICE (i.e., in low-risk patients only and following validated pre-test probability assessment). There appears to be a lack of clarity or training regarding the scope and limitations of such tools in the primary care context.

4. Risk of repetition in similar settings
The inquest heard no evidence that the walk-in centre has a specific protocol or decision-support mechanism in place for the recognition and escalation of potentially life-threatening conditions such as pulmonary embolism. There is a risk that similar failings could occur in future, particularly where patients present with non-specific symptoms and abnormal vital signs."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide; Mr. Pugh having suspended himself in his cell at HMP Swaleside [REDACTED].","Michael Pugh was found in his cell on 29 June 2024 having died. He was subject of an ACCT at the time of his death. It was determined at the last ACCT review before his death that he should be subject to hourly observations. Observations were carried out on the afternoon of 28 June 2024 but recorded incorrectly. No observations were carried out on 29 June 2024 between 07:22 and 09:57 when Mr. Pugh was discovered having died, but the ongoing record was completed retrospectively to show that they had been carried out.","(1) The prison officers who gave evidence in relation to observations on 28 and 29 June 2024 were relatively new recruits, one having 3 months' experience following POELT training and the other 1 month's experience. Both officers gave evidence that following their POELT training their understanding of the ACCT process was incomplete; one stating “observations were explained but I didn’t have a fair idea what to do or how to undergo the process”, another stating “I didn’t understand the importance of observing a prisoner at unpredictable times. Even though I was told the observations should be hourly it was not explained to me how to stagger timing. I misunderstood what was required of me in recording the details when I recorded them as having happened at 13:00, 14:00, 15:00 and 16:00.”"

Griffin,Dorset,"Secretary of State for Health and Social Care; Minister of State for Prisons, Probation and Reducing Reoffending; Governing Governor at HMP Guys Marsh; Chief Executive at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust","On 22 November 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Sheldon Lawrence Jeans, born on 24 October 1990 who was aged 32 years at the time of his death.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest before a jury on 22 July 2025.

The medical cause of death was:

Ia Idiosyncratic response to alcoholic intoxication and medicinal drugs (Pregabalin, Mirtazapine, Dihydrocodeine and Quetiapine)

II Partial postural asphyxia

The conclusion of the inquest was misadventure.","On the 13 November 2022 Sheldon Lawrence Jeans, who was a serving prisoner at HMP Guys Marsh, was found in a collapsed and unresponsive condition on the floor of his cell. At the conclusion of the inquest the jury recorded the following under Section 3 of the Record of Inquest:

How
Sheldon passed away due to an idiosyncratic response to alcoholic intoxication and medicinal drugs combined with partial postural asphyxia.

When
This occurred on or about 13 November 2022.

Where
Sheldon was in Cell 37, A Spur, Mercia Wing, HMP Guys Marsh, Shaftesbury, Dorset when this incident occurred.

Circumstances

Based on evidence provided, during 12 November 2022 Sheldon was in a heightened mental state. This was brought on by the impending news of his parole hearing, challenges encountered in his relationship and this combined with his known historical mental health conditions.

Sheldon acquired access and consumed non-prescribed drugs. He also acquired access and consumed illicitly brewed alcohol 'hooch'. Although the levels of these substances on their own would not be fatal, when consumed altogether, they caused a high level of sedation and this combined with Sheldon's body posture resulted in respiratory depression.

At no point had it been identified that Sheldon had in his possession or was under the influence of non-prescribed drugs and hooch. This resulted in no additional checks on Sheldon during the night until he was found at 5:10 am.

Sheldon did not intend to end his life as a consequence of his actions but deliberately consumed these substances.","(1) There is a lack of national policy, and local guidance at HMP Guys Marsh, to inform staff working in prisons of the dangers of illicitly brewed alcohol, also known as hooch. There is also a lack of policy and guidance to assist those working within the prisoner estate with the management and governance of the access to, and use of, illicitly brewed alcohol.

Illicitly brewed alcohol is a common substance across the prisoner estate. Evidence was given at the inquest that in the month of September 2022, 215.5 litres of illicitly brewed alcohol were seized at HMP Guys Marsh. Evidence was given that hooch continues to be a common problem in prisons. Illicitly brewed alcohol in prison is a substance made from items which are readily and legitimately available to prisoners.

Hooch was described as a very, very dangerous substance during the course of the evidence and as is clear from the cause of his death, was central to the death of Sheldon. Evidence was given that it has sedative effects which if taken with certain medications can increase the sedative effects.

Evidence was given that the policies in place concerning the possession and use of illicit substances within the prisoner estate at the time of Sheldon’s death, and those in place now, focus on drugs or medication, but are silent in relation to alcohol. I am concerned that this lack of guidance could lead to a future death in prison custody

(2) Prisoners can have access to certain medication to hold in their possession which could be accessed by other prisoners and there is a lack of national policy, and local policy at HMP Guys Marsh, from a healthcare and prison perspective, around the governance of medication held in possession in the prison estate.

Evidence was heard that when a person is prescribed medication in prison, it can either be taken under supervision, or a prisoner can be provided with the medication to hold in their possession, in their cell.

In these cases, the prisoner is responsible for the safety of that medication. Prior to being provided with medication in their possession a risk assessment is undertaken upon the prisoner to assess the risks associated with the drug and also the risks associated with prisoner. Whilst medications defined as controlled drugs would not be given in possession, it is possible to have medication that could cause death in possession. Although Sheldon was not prescribed the medications that caused his death, evidence was given some of those medications are suitable to be prescribed to a prisoner in possession. It is not known how Sheldon accessed the medication found in his system at the time of his death, other than to say he obtained it at HMP Guys Marsh.

At HMP Guys Marsh, which may not be the case across the prisoner estate, a lockable cupboard is provided in cells for the storage of medication.

Evidence was given that at times cells will be left insecure at HMP Guys Marsh when the prison is in a state of unlock, such as when prisoners collect meals or for example when they go for showers or are out of the cells on association. Evidence was given that prisoners go into each other's cells when they are in a state of unlock. Prisoners could therefore enter another prisoner's cell. If medication is not held securely in a lockable cupboard there is a risk that prisoners who are not prescribed medication, could access medication.

Evidence was given at the inquest that due to the chaotic life some prisoners lead, even when provided with lockable cupboards, cells at HMP Guys Marsh have been seen to contain medication that is not secure and is strewn all over the cell. The medication in Sheldon’s cell at the time of his death was found insecure in a Tupperware container.

Further, if medication prescribed to a prisoner is discontinued, evidence was heard that the onus is upon the prisoner returning any excess medication to the healthcare department at HMP Guys Marsh which may be the position in other prisons.

The issues around securing of medication held in possession in a cell and the onus being upon prisoners to return unused medication, carries a risk of prisoners accessing unprescribed medication. At the time of Sheldon’s death he was not prescribed the medications found in his system and he had in his cell excessive amounts of medication he was prescribed and had previously been prescribed and discontinued.

I am therefore concerned the lack of guidance and policy nationally, and locally at HMP Guys Marsh, on storage of in possession medication and what to do when a medication is discontinued to ensure prisoners do not continue to possess left over medication, could lead to future deaths."

Charles,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton","Secretary of State for Health; Chief Executive Officer, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust",On 28 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Kate Young aged 49. The inquest was concluded on 5 June 2025. The medical cause of death was 1a hanging.,"On 20 November 2023 Samantha Young died at her home, [REDACTED]. Sadly, she had intentionally taken her own life by hanging herself with a ligature. The background is that Samantha Young had struggled for a number of years with her mental health. She had, impressively, managed to control an alcohol addiction and had indeed stopped taking alcohol. At the time of her death she was under very great stress following marriage breakdown and relocation. She had attempted suicide before. She was under the care of the CMHT, she had been and continued to access private medical care, which was undoubtedly beneficial. She had received substantial and effective family support. Her condition had deteriorated in early November 2023. It is clear that she had made many attempts – successfully so - to access medical treatment, and statutory service support right to the end whilst battling her mental health issues. She had done all she could to help herself and remain in the life of her daughter.","A. Assessment of the risk that a patient poses to themselves or others is clearly a cornerstone of the work of an NHS Trust dealing with mental health. At the material time there was a lack of any training as to completion of risk assessments. I was informed by a senior manager of Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust that with the translation of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust into the new Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that issue of training is being addressed. However it emerged at the inquest that there do not appear to be any firm plans to train agency staff. Agency staff form a significant percentage of frontline staff.

Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust should review its provision of training for agency staff, in particular in respect of risk assessments.

B. Wider family and friends of the deceased perspective were not contacted. A patient's family and friends are clearly an invaluable resource for learning more about a patient's mental health and specifically risk to life, the support available to the patient and the potential for synergistic support with the NHS Trust. This PFD is not the first time that the issue has been raised with Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust: in 2023 the Senior Coroner for Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton issued a PFD on similar grounds arising out of the inquest into the death of Kirsty Taylor. The Senior Coroner observed in the PFD that ""I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being sufficiently, effectively and meaningfully listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatment or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions."" Moreover, in 2021 a report commissioned by NHS England into Southern Health Foundation Trust similarly reported on shortfall in communication with families.

Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust should review guidelines and procedures concerning communication with family and friends of patients with mental health difficulties by its permanent and agency staff, and monitoring of whether such communication has taken place."

Rhodes-Kemp,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton","Chief Executive Officer, Hampshire County Council; Chief Executive Officer, National Highways","On 9 July 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of James Alexander Scott aged 25. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

On the evening of 5 July 2024 James Scott, aged 25, was driving southbound on the A33 when he lost control of the vehicle which turned sideways crossing onto the opposite carriageway colliding with a northbound vehicle. He sustained fatal injuries and was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene.","This report concerns a fatal road traffic collision between a Vauxhall Corsa and a Ford Ranger towing a SBS trailer upon which was a trailer, which occurred around 21:44 on Friday 5 July 2024 on the A33 near Kings Worthy, Hampshire.
Mr Scott was travelling south in his Vauxhall Corsa where the vehicle has passed through an area of standing water. Consequently, the Corsa has entered a state of clockwise yaw, passing through the central reserve and into the path of the oncoming Ford Ranger which was travelling north.
The Vauxhall and Ford have collided in 'T-bone' formation, with Mr Scott sustaining fatal injuries and being sadly declared deceased at the scene.
On examination it was observed that two of the drains to the nearside of the southbound lane were compacted with vegetation, resulting in little or no surface drainage.
This is despite annual scheduled maintenance for year 2023/2024 taking place on 19 May 2023 and 15 November 2023. This included clearing gullies and catch pits either side of the A33.
A temporary “Flood” warning sign was located within the nearside grass verge, around 8 metres north of the commencement of the flooding.
The ‘temporary’ warning sign had been present for about 5 years prior to the collision.
Whilst ownership of the sign is subject to debate between National Highways and Hampshire County Council, the area is known to be a flood risk and has been one for several years prior to the collision.
The forensic examiner concluded that the standing water was a contributory factor in the collision and was relevant to factors affecting Mr Scott.","(1) The area is a known flood risk  
(2) Whilst the precise cause of the flooding is unknown, a more regular maintenance schedule may have prevented the buildup of vegetation within the gullies and therefore assisted in the drainage of the heavy rainfall experienced that day thus reducing the amount of surface water present on the road  
(3) The fact that only a temporary sign was in place in an area known for years to be a flood risk  
(4) The surface water was a contributory factor in this death"

Suicide

1a) [REDACTED] Toxicity",Isaac Arlan Ingle-Gillis was suffering from depression. He died on 9 February 2025 at the Ty Hotel in Magor from the effects of an intentional overdose of [REDACTED].,"Isaac Arlan Ingle-Gillis presented to his GP on 20/12/2024 having made preparatory attempts to obtain [REDACTED] to end his life and had attempted to stab himself through the heart.

The assessment included information obtained from a telephone conversation with the GP prior to the assessment.

Isaac was discharged following the assessment without follow up. Thereafter Isaac engaged with his GP but took his own life on 9/2/2025, in the circumstances described in Box 4.

During the inquest I heard evidence that the CRHTT do not have access to the GP records. I could not determine on balance of probabilities that access to additional information recorded by the GP in their consultation with Isaac on 9/2/2025 would have changed the assessment made by the CRHTT on this occasion.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2025

The conclusion of the inquest was recorded as

Natural causes

The medical cause of death was:

1a) Lower respiratory tract infection
1b) Chronic lung disease
1c) Extreme prematurity. Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Epilepsy and global developmental delay.

2. Previous duodenal perforation.","Robyn Anne Chambers sustained hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy when she was born prematurely at 23 weeks gestation. This led to significant physical and neurological problems, including ongoing respiratory problems. On 26/10/2024, Robyn developed a chest infection. Despite intensive treatment, the effects were overwhelming and resulted in Robyn’s death on 2/11/2024 at Ty Hafan Hospice in Sully.","Following Robyn’s traumatic birth she was cared for at home by her parents. Robyn needed extensive medical intervention and monitoring at home. When she became unwell on 26/10/2024 her parents called an ambulance and were informed that it would take about 8 hours for an Amber 1 ambulance to respond. Robyn’s parents decided to take Robyn to hospital themselves which was a difficult and potentially dangerous journey because Robyn had complicated medical equipment that needed to remain attached.

The estimated length of time for an ambulance to be dispatched and the decision taken by Robyn’s parents to convey her to hospital had no impact on Robyn’s care and did not affect the outcome.

However, having heard evidence from Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, I note that the main reason for the delay in dispatching emergency ambulances remains the length of time it is taking for ambulances to be released from the emergency department of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board hospitals, predominantly the Grange University Hospital. Evidence provided at inquest indicated that, at the time that Robyn’s parents called for an ambulance, the longest time an ambulance was delayed at the GUH was in excess of 10 hours."

Singleton,Wiltshire and Swindon,The Chief Executive; Managing Director Home Group Limited,"On 14 December 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher John O’Donnell and I opened an inquest into his death on 30 September 2024. On 18 July 2025 I concluded Christopher’s inquest. I found the medical cause of death was as follows:

1a. Asphyxia due to airway obstruction by vomit
1b. Drug toxicity

By way of a conclusion, I recorded a short form conclusion of drug related and as to when where and how (by what means Christopher came by his death) I provided the following:

Christopher John O’Donnell (Chris) lived in supported living accommodation at Canal House, Chris had a past medical history which included drug and alcohol abuse, together with mental health issues, for which he had been prescribed medication. In November 2023, Chris admitted that he had not taken his medication for some months, leading to a noticeable return of his paranoia and persecution complex, resulting in Chris believing wrongly, that it was not safe for him to remain at Canal House, but he had no alternative accommodation to go to.

On 12 December 2023, Chris was found deceased in a communal lounge at Canal House, having consumed a substantial, but not fatal amount of his methadone medication, that he had been allowed access to, notwithstanding the recognised risks, which had led to him vomiting and being asphyxiated by his airway being obstructed by vomit.","Having considered the evidence, I found the following facts in relation to the circumstances of Chris’ death.

Chris’ death was drug related in that the post-mortem confirmed that he had taken a substantial, but not necessarily fatal amount of his prescribed Methadone that led to his central nervous systems including breathing and heart rate being slowed down. Common side effects are nausea and vomiting with the vomit being aspirated causing obstruction of Chris’ airway leading to asphyxia and death.

I found that the following factors more than minimally contributed to his decision to take that medication.

Firstly, that Christopher had suffered for a number of years with drug and alcohol abuse and with his mental health, for which he had been prescribed medication. Christopher had stated that he had stopped taking the medication leading to a return of paranoia and a persecution complex leading to Chris believing it was not safe for him to live at Canal House, but Chris did not have any alternative accommodation to go to on 12 December 2023.

Secondly, that Chris had a stockpile of Methadone in his room which he had access to as from 11 December 2023 and consumed one half of, leading to the sequence of events that caused his death, despite the risk of that stockpile, being recognised beforehand.

During the course of the inquest, I heard evidence from [REDACTED] a mental health support worker at Canal House that she had had a discussion with [REDACTED] Christopher’s recovery co-ordinator with the local substance misuse team, that Chris had a stockpile of Methadone medication in his room and that she was concerned at the risk that it posed. In evidence [REDACTED] said that she had spoken to Christopher about agreeing to giving up the medication and returning it to a pharmacy but as he had not consented, that had not happened. She also believed that she had raised it with her manager, but the view was, that as Christopher had not consented to the medication being confiscated there was nothing they could do.","The issue that I had was that there appeared to be no basis for or consideration of the supported living accommodation provider taking action to provide safeguarding for Christopher by removing the excess medication so that it was not within his control. I was informed by [REDACTED] that the supported living accommodation provider did not allow staff to hold any medication even if it was done with the intention of providing safeguarding to someone, who by all accounts, was undergoing a mental health crisis.

I would hope that the organisation will review its policies as to what action (if any) it can take when it is made aware of a risk to a resident, rather than to only take action with the resident’s consent."

The medical cause of death was:

1a) Severe hypoxic ischaemic brain injury associated with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with features highly suggestive of neck compression

The conclusion of the inquest was a short form with a narrative which read as follows:

“Melissa died as a result of unlawful killing caused by both the act of strangulation and also due to the acts and omissions by the home entrusted with her care.
The home failed Melissa in numerous ways: the resident who went on to strangle her should not have been placed in the same facility as Melissa, at all, based on his known risks. The decision was wrongly made to place him in the same facility with an ineffective care plan and risk assessment, with staff that were not trained on his level of risk, and managers who failed to act when concerns were highlighted by staff and Melissa.
In addition, the placing authority knowing this resident's risks should not have agreed the care plan and package being offered, furthermore they also failed to act when concerns were raised.
With this resident’s known risks he should not have been offered a placement at the home and the catalogue of failures resulting in his placement with no effective risk assessment in place resulted in the death of Melissa.”","Melissa was autistic, suffered with ADHD and had a diagnosis of Asperger’s, she was 18 years old and was vulnerable. She became a resident of Alexandra Homes in August 2014 along with another resident, called [REDACTED], who went on to murder her on 12 October 2014.

[REDACTED] had undergone an assessment with a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, [REDACTED], who formed the opinion that he presented with a significantly high risk of future violence towards others, his violence also includes sexually harmful behaviour towards others including strangulation, the frequency and imminence of violence is also high, she said, that he should be supervised at all times. [REDACTED] had said that he wanted to kill somebody and have sex with their dead body.
[REDACTED] was moving from a school where he had been supervised 24 hours a day on a 2:1 basis during the day and 1.5:1 at night.

When at Alexandra Homes his care plan stated 1:1 but was not 24 hours a day and was not 1:1 care at all, in that at night there were 16 residents to 1 support staff and during the day he was allocated a support worker to do activities, but he could wander around the home on his own unsupervised.

Support workers, staff and Melissa raised concerns about [REDACTED]’s behaviour generally and specifically that Melissa was frightened of him.

On 12 October at about 11.40pm, [REDACTED] and Melissa had already gone to their bedrooms, Jason was unsupervised, when staff heard a loud bang. One of them said ...” I ran up the stairs and opened the fire door, Melissa was on her back, her legs were slightly skew whiff. Her head was slightly to one side facing the stairs, I could see one eye which was open and there was a cut above it, I could see marks around her neck which were very red. She was fully clothed and she appeared dead...""
Melissa was taken to the local hospital but died a few days later from her injuries.","(1) The offer of placement and the level of supervision i.e. 1:1 was misleading, there was no clarification for example, 24 hrs cover, 8 hrs cover during the day only, or when carrying out activities or when outside the home only.

The inquests found that Mr Reilly died as a result of multiple traumatic injuries, and Miss Cox died as a result of a traumatic head injury. The conclusion of both inquests was that both Mr Reilly and Miss Cox died in a road traffic collision.","On 1 April 2024, Mr Reilly was driving a Range Rover in company with his partner and her three children, one of whom was Miss Cox. They were driving along the M1 southbound, when approximately 1 mile before the exit slip road for junction 5 for Watford, Mr Reilly lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the vehicle leaving the carriageway to the nearside, through a gap in the safety barrier that runs along the nearside of the M1 and colliding with trees. As a result of the collision both Mr Reilly and Miss Cox sustained fatal traumatic injuries, and their deaths were confirmed at the scene.","I heard evidence that along this section of the M1 southbound there are safety barriers to the nearside of the carriageway. It was explained to me that if a vehicle loses control, the safety barrier is designed to prevent a vehicle from leaving the carriageway – the idea being that a vehicle that has lost control will continue along the safety barrier before coming to a more controlled stop, thereby minimising the risk of serious injury or death to passengers.

It was further explained to me that this is particularly important when a high-speed carriageway (such as a motorway) is lined with established trees, as is the case here. This is because any vehicle that has lost control and leaves the carriageway is likely to do so at high speed and collide with these established trees. This would likely lead to a very sharp and sudden deceleration, and may cause the vehicle to overturn, which significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury and death to passengers.

In this case, I was shown images of the collision scene which depict the presence of safety barriers shortly before and shortly after the collision site. Whilst I heard evidence that, in general, gaps are sometimes inserted into the safety barrier for the purposes of access or due to the presence of other safety measures (e.g. a grassed bank), the witnesses from the Roads Policing Unit could not offer any explanation for why there is a gap in the safety barrier at this location.

Consequently, I am concerned that there is a gap in the safety barrier at this location, which for the reasons outlined above gives rise to a risk that future deaths may occur."

Malhotra,London Inner West,HMPPS; Minister of State for Prisons; Ministry of Justice/HMP Wandsworth; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care; Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust,"On 21 February 2024 an inquest opened into the death of Patryk Gladysz, aged 27 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 July 2025. The conclusion of the jury was that the deceased hung himself with a ligature. His intentions in doing so remain unknown. It is likely that the following factors are likely to have possibly contributed, in a more than minimal way to Patryk’s death:

1. There was no in-depth psychological assessment of Patryk.
2. There were low staffing levels in the prison and the in-reach healthcare teams.
3. There was a lack of clear inter-departmental communication.
4. There was a lack of knowledge of Patryk’s history and personal circumstances and inconsistent familiarity of related policies and procedures.","Patryk had a diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2019. He was under the care of his community mental health team, with regular contact with his care co-ordinator and received a fortnightly anti-psychotic depot injection. On 17 April 2023 Patryk arrived at HMP Wandsworth awaiting extradition to Poland. It was noted he required an interpreter and had limited English in his Prison Escort Record and NOMIS, although this was subsequently inconsistently recorded. He claimed asylum on 26 April 2023 preventing his extradition. Patryk was under the care of the in-reach mental health team (Oxleas) within HMP Wandsworth. He received a fortnightly depot injection, which was missed on 23 November 2023. He next received his injection on 14 December 2023 – 5 weeks later. On 14 December 2023 he first reported hearing voices. Until the time of his death, Patryk had not been seen by a psychiatrist. An assessment and risk assessment of Patryk took place on 20 and 27 October 2023 – evidence before the jury was that it should have been completed within 5 days of Patryk being case loaded to the mental health in-reach team; this was in April 2023 – the assessment was approximately 6 months late. An official interpreter was not used for the assessments, which lasted 15-20 minutes. The jury heard mental health in-reach team staff were understaffed at the time, which impacted their ability to undertake meaningful mental health assessments and that staff who administered his depot injection did not know he previously attempted to ligature in the community. He was not allocated a key worker and HMP Wandsworth adopted a qualified key worker scheme. There was no entry on Patryk’s NOMIS confirming there was any meaningful interaction with him between 22 May 2023 and 5 January 2024. Patryk had two interactions with Catch22, the last interaction was on 22 May 2023. There was inconsistency in staff knowledge of whether health care staff had access to the NOMIS. Senior Prison officers demonstrated a lack of awareness of policy documents concerning the heightened risk of foreign national prisoners.
On 5 January 2024 at 09:08 Patryk was found in his cell with a ligature around his neck. A return of spontaneous circulation was achieved, and he was taken to St George’s Hospital at 10:46. A CT scan showed complete loss of grey white matter differentiation and Patryk’s death was confirmed on 19 January 2025 at St George’s Hospital.","(1) Staffing within the Mental Health In-reach team impacting the timely undertaking of meaningful and quality mental health assessments.
(2) Staffing within HMP Wandsworth resulting in a dilution to the requirements for the key worker scheme.
(3) Knowledge of prison staff of the heightened risk of foreign nationals in custody, despite a higher proportion of foreign nationals being detained at HMP Wandsworth.
(4) Communication between prison and healthcare staff regarding: (a) knowledge sharing of those presenting with a serious and enduring mental health illness, such as schizophrenia; (b) inconsistent understanding of healthcare access to the NOMIS by both prison and healthcare staff; and (c) de-activation of NOMIS accounts for healthcare staff due to lack of use – 21 healthcare accounts were de-activated notwithstanding an increase in available terminals.
(5) Prison officer checks of roll calls/ACCT observations - recent audit by HMP Wandsworth suggests ongoing challenges.
(6) First aid refresher training is not up to date for all healthcare staff."

Hobson,Yorkshire West Eastern,Leeds City Council Highways.,On 15 January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dorothy Elizabeth Wagstaff who died on 11 January 2025. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 26 June 2025. The medical cause of death was 1a) Multiple Traumatic Injuries 2) Multiple Medical Comorbidities.,"On 11 January 2025 Dorothy Elizabeth Wagstaff was driving towards Bramhope on the A660 Leeds Road at Otley when her car steadily moved to the left of, then off, the inside lane before colliding with a concrete post to the road barrier. The car then collided with temporary plastic barriers which provided little or no resistance before hitting a further section of the road barrier comprised of posts and poles. The car then proceeded to hit a lamp post before coming to a stop in the road. Elizabeth sustained multiple traumatic injuries. Paramedics attended but her death was confirmed at the scene at 1057 hours. It is more likely than not that Elizabeth suffered a medical episode that led to her car initially colliding with the road barrier post and the gap in the road barrier enabled the car to then proceed to collide with road barrier posts and poles and the lamp post before coming to rest.","(1) The trajectory of Mrs Wagstaff’s car after the initial collision with the concrete post involved passing through temporary plastic barriers which, on the evidence heard, offered no resistance such that the car then proceeded to leave the road and collide with a lamp post before coming to rest back on the road.

(2) Upon examining photographs of the scene, the road barrier/railings and sections of the road, it was noted that plastic barriers similar to those referred to in the Record of Inquest above were present in another section of the A660 Leeds Road.

(3) Within the evidence adduced at the inquest, it was noted that Leeds City Council Highways Department have indicated that a schedule of works will be created with a view to replacing the old concrete and metal pole barriers with metal pedestrian railings in this area of the A660.

(4) The concern that I raise is that photographs considered at the inquest indicated the ongoing presence of plastic barriers in a gap in the existing barrier/railings elsewhere along the stretch of road. Plastic barriers were a factor in the circumstances of the accident in which Mrs Langstaff sadly died. If that remains the case, I am of the view that action should be taken to prevent a risk of future deaths."

Pemberton,Greater Manchester West,The Secretary of State for the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA); The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents,"On 29 April 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of David Joseph HAYES aged 82. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was Accident, and the medical cause of death was
1a Pneumonitis
1b Aspiration due to ingestion of a chemical substance.","The deceased suffered from dementia in Alzheimer’s disease and was admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital on 16 April 2025 following a previous attendance and discharge due to accidental ingestion of a washing detergent on 15 April 2025. This had occurred when he had made a cup of tea at home and put washing detergent into the cup instead of milk after an apparent confusion.

He had vomited following the ingestion and it is likely that he aspirated. On admission, he was discovered to be suffering from suspected pneumonitis which was considered likely to have arisen from aspiration of detergent and stomach acid when vomiting after the accidental ingestion. He received treatment by antibiotics, steroids and analgesia. He experienced atrial fibrillation, and his heart rate remained inadequately controlled despite treatment. He continued to decline, and palliative care was provided. He passed away on 21 April 2025.","1. During the course of evidence it was noted that the plastic bottle-like packaging in which the white liquid washing detergent was contained was confused by the deceased as a milk carton. He suffered from dementia and appeared to have poured the liquid into a cup of tea he had made, subsequently placing the detergent container in the fridge.

2. The container had a screw top with no safety features meaning that it would be easily accessible by a person with reduced capacity or dementia, or even a child enabling the contents able to be consumed with apparent ease.

3. Whilst the liquid was deemed to have low toxicity, on the evidence it led to vomiting and aspiration causing damage to the lungs and subsequent breathing difficulties. In this case this was causative of death.

4. In my judgment, there is a risk of similar events in respect of the ingestion of a liquid washing detergent because:
   a. The colouring of the liquid is similar to items which a person suffering from an infirmity such as dementia may get confused – here milk
   b. The shape of the packaging could be misconstrued in these circumstances
   c. The screw top lid with no child or resistance protection is easily accessible.

5. The level of printed warnings on the labelling was not explored during the hearing, but this may not specify that the item could be a risk to vulnerable adults as well as the need to keep out of the reach of children.

6. The public knowledge of these risks is not likely to be at a level where households in which vulnerable adults reside are aware of the need to safeguard detergents and make them less accessible."

Pountney,Yorkshire South West,"Chief Executive, East Midlands Ambulance Service; Chief Constable for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Police","An investigation into the death of Kaine Regan Fletcher was opened on 28 September 2022, and the final inquest hearing is currently being heard by me, sitting with a jury. The final inquest hearing started on 30 June 2025 and is due to conclude on 25 July 2025.

The evidence is currently ongoing.","Kaine was a 26-year-old male with a diagnosis of Paranoid Personality Disorder and a history of substance misuse.

On 2 July 2022, Kaine called the police via 999 making threats to kill, if the police did not attend to him at his mum’s address. A double-crewed, marked police vehicle attended Kaine and arrived at 16:00. On arrival, the response officers formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness, and that they may need to exercise their s.136 MHA 1983 powers to detain him. Kaine told the officers that he had recently used cocaine. The officers requested assistance from the Street Triage Team, a team formed through collaboration between Nottinghamshire Police and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, who duly attended to assess Kaine arriving at 17:04. The Street Triage Team comprised of one police officer and one community psychiatric nurse, travelling together in a marked police car. Kaine was assessed by the community psychiatric nurse to not require a Mental Health Act Assessment, and so the police did not exercise their s.136 powers. Rather, having had his physical health checked by paramedics between approximately 17:27 and 17:42, he was conveyed by marked police car back to his residential dwelling at the YMCA in Hucknall. The police incident log confirmed that Kaine was at the property by 19:46.

On 3 July 2022, at 00:04 and 00:16, respectively, two 999 calls were made by a member of Kaine’s family to EMAS due to a concern that he may have attempted to take his own life and, by the later call, that he was uncontactable by phone. EMAS advised the family member that the incident had been logged as a Category 3 response, and that there was an 8 hour wait for an ambulance.

At 00:33 a member of Kaine’s family called the police to report their concerns. A police resource was allocated to the incident, and two response officers in a marked police vehicle arrived at the YMCA at 01:55 to conduct a ‘safe and well check’. Those officers quickly formed the view that Kaine was suffering an acute episode of mental illness and that he had taken illicit substances, namely cocaine and nitrous oxide. To begin with, Kaine is amenable to attending hospital voluntarily for a Mental Health Act Assessment. He followed the police officers out of the building and got into their marked police car. The situation changed rapidly and within seconds of being inside the vehicle, Kaine vocalised his belief that the officers are not really police. The officers showed Kaine their ID, but the situation persisted and one of the officers detained Kaine using her s.136 powers; handcuffs are applied. This happened at around 02:34. More units were requested and arrived at the scene. Kaine began to resist the detention, and there was then a period of approximately half an hour where Kaine was being restrained by officers. The restraint continued as officers attempted to gain effective control of Kaine so that they could convey him to a place of safety by police vehicle.

During the period of restraint, Kaine’s physical condition deteriorated, and at 03:03 EMAS are called when the police recognise that he was displaying symptoms of Acute Behavioural Disorder. The incident was then deemed a medical emergency.

EMAS arrived on scene at 03:18. Kaine was pre-alerted to the Queens Medical Centre Resuscitation Department and conveyed there by ambulance. He arrived at 03:47.

Despite the best efforts of the medical teams at QMC, Kaine had developed rhabdomyolysis and went into multi-system organ failure, which culminated in an unsurvivable cardiac arrest. Kaine died at 09:46 on 3 July 2022.

The cause of death provided by the Home Office Pathologist is: 1(a) the physiological effects of exertion following a period of restraint, combined with cocaine and other substances.","Confusion over applicable local policy and working standards for dealing with s.136 detention

I am concerned that there is a lack of understanding by the police and EMAS on local policy and working standards for dealing with s.136 detention.

At the outset of this investigation, a direction was given for disclosure of “Local memoranda or policies concerning how EMAS and Notts police jointly manage health incidents”. In response to that direction, a number of policies were disclosed, including a document entitled “Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Multi-Agency Policy & Procedure Review Group Memorandum of Understanding: Joint Agency, sections 135 and 136 Mental Health Act 1983 Procedures”. Various versions of this policy were disclosed to the coroner, including a 2018, 2021 and 2024 version.

During the course of the inquest so far, I heard evidence from both the police and the ambulance service in relation to the local policy for managing s.136 incidents. The police and the ambulance service do not share an understanding of which policy they are expected to adhere to and whether there is a joint local policy. The police consider that the document above (as amended) is the applicable framework, whilst EMAS are currently unable to tell me if this policy has been agreed to by them, notwithstanding that they appear as one of the agencies that formed part of the working group for each version of the MOU. The witness who gave policy evidence on behalf of EMAS told me that they only work to their own internal local standard, which is different to that in the MOU.

Persons detained under s.136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 are some of the most vulnerable in society. Their liberty has been removed, and they are reliant upon state agencies to protect their right to life. I am extremely concerned that there is no joined up thinking, or understanding, between the police and the ambulance service as to which policy and which working standards apply when furthering the protection of that right. I am concerned that this lack of basic understanding of policy and working standards by emergency services, if it persists, poses a risk of preventable future deaths."

Brittain,London Inner North,"Chief Midwifery Officer, NHS England; President, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health","An investigation into the death of Alfie Lydon (date of birth 28/2/24) was opened on 26/3/24, following his death on 12/3/24.

An inquest was opened on 18/4/24 and concluded on 27/6/25.

The conclusion reached was that Alfie died from natural causes.","Alfie was admitted to hospital on 6/3/24 after being found profoundly unwell at home. He was subsequently transferred to another hospital for intensive care support but sadly died on 12/3/24 from a then unknown cause.

A post mortem examination demonstrated that he died from the consequences of a viral infection.

Prior to his admission to hospital, concerns had been raised by Alfie’s parents to the community midwife team regarding the adequacy of his feeding and increasing lethargy. On two occasions midwives discussed Alfie with the neonatal team at the local hospital but admission was not felt to be necessary.

These discussions were not documented by the hospital doctors who took the calls and, on one occasion, not documented by the midwife who made the call. As such, it was difficult to identify who provided advice to the midwives and the rationale for the decision-making process.

Ultimately, given the overwhelming nature of the infection Alfie suffered from, I concluded that it was not likely earlier admission would have prevented his death.","1. I heard evidence that the vast majority of hospital Trusts do not have processes in place to document external calls from midwives to hospital teams. Concerns were raised that this can result in a lack of continuity and escalation of care, particularly with regards to parental concerns.

The hospital Trust involved has taken steps to document such calls now but this is undertaken on paper, which is subsequently uploaded to the hospital records. They plan to implement an electronic solution but not for some time.

There is a concern that a lack of contemporaneous, accurate and immediately available documentation of discussions between community and hospital teams could result in deaths in future similar circumstances. Given that this is not simply a local issue, this concern warrants raising at a national level."

Oliver,Yorkshire West Western,Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust; CQC North; NHS England (Reg 28 Reports),"On 3 May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Myles Edward Scriven aged 31. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:
Myles Edward Scriven died a natural death to which neglect contributed.",Myles Edward Scriven died at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary on 16 April 2023. Contributing to the cause of his death was lack of adjustments for his autism and learning disabilities resulting in incorrect decision making as to his care and medication.,"The rider of neglect attaches to the actions of the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust (‘the Trust’). It relates to the lack of adjustments that were identified as being required to treat Myles safely in the context of his learning disabilities (‘LD’) and autism, notably during his admission 20-25 October 2022. It is true that evidence from Trust witnesses has been sufficient to demonstrate that the Trust is aware of the issues arising in this case at least in terms of training and professional input. It has an ongoing programme of training in relation to learning disabilities and autism in clinical care and they have people in post enhancing learning disability provision. The crux of the remaining concern is in relation to auditing the impact of all of this in terms of auditing the outcome of this work. To be fair, Trust evidence was that there is now auditing of mental capacity assessments and there is dedicated nursing leadership walkaround of all wards auditing LD and autism policies being applied. However, there is this remaining evidential reality: much of what is now in place was already in place in 2022 – not least key personnel who gave evidence at the inquest, but also VIP passports, training and all the underlying regulatory underpinning. But in Myles’s case it simply had no impact whatsoever. One witness’s own ‘spot-on’ entries in the EPR on 21 October were just not acted upon by colleagues and had zero effect when she went on leave thereafter. Clinicians were applying Mental Capacity Act principle 1 but not 2. ‘Culturally’ speaking, that one obtaining in secondary care after the witness went on leave seems to have been stuck in another era. So, the question is - how it is proposed to ensure full compliance with best practice and by when?"

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:
Myles Edward Scriven died a natural death to which neglect contributed.",Myles Edward Scriven died at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary on 16 April 2023. Contributing to the cause of his death was lack of adjustments for his autism and learning disabilities resulting in incorrect decision making as to his care and medication.,"While the rider of Neglect does not attach to the actions of the Dalton Surgery, the fact remains that between 16 and 20 March 2023 Myles had several contacts with the Dalton Surgery while he was suffering with an ongoing Pulmonary Embolism. None of these resulted in a referral to secondary care. The combined evidence of three expert witnesses was that the manner in which his care was handled at this stage contributed to his death. The following are concerns that I have arising from the evidence in the Inquest.
1. Ignorance of what was required for Myles in the circumstances of his Learning Disability and Autism - the GPs clearly only had a superficial grasp of the regulatory requirements and realities to do with Learning Disabilities. They are clearly well intentioned and caring but their appreciation and approach seems to have been based entirely on professional experience and good intentions rather than real knowledge of what was required and how to implement it.
Notably:
• They repeatedly used the words learning difficulties and learning disabilities interchangeably and apparently randomly – I am not told that Myles had a personal preference about which to use that they deferred to. Essentially, they seem to have been ignorant as to the distinction.
• They made only the most modest adjustments for Myles’s Learning Disabilities and Autism.
• They clearly had very little grasp of what the Learning Disabilities Register was and how it worked. Neither of the GPs who gave evidence were able to provide a solid, reliable, version of how it operated in their practice, when or/if Myles had been entered on to it, whether it was distinct from the psychiatric review - one seemed to conflate the two and the other said that it was something managed by a Nurse in the practice. It is quite evident that correspondence was coming in from Learning Disabilities Psychiatry but nothing at all from Social Services. This is not something that seems to have triggered any particular reaction at the GP level. They seemed to operate on the basis that the Learning Disabilities ‘box had been ticked’ and that nothing further was needed. In fact, Myles seems to have been on the Register from 2020 but by 20 October 2022 when he had been at hospital in relation to his PE he had no Learning Disability Social Worker and concomitantly no VIP passport on admission to hospital. The GPs clearly had no idea of how important all this was. I heard evidence from a secondary care Learning Disabilities Professional that they, in secondary care, rely a great deal on primary care to get these things sorted out. Here, nothing went back from the Practice to the Learning Disabilities Service to chase these things.
2. The failure of the GP to record numeric observations properly on 20 March 2023.
3. The failure of the Dalton Surgery to undertake any rigorous and detailed internal review for learning purposes after this incident."

Hassell,London Inner North,Senior Partner Mountfield Surgery; Chief Executive Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust,"On 5 February 2025, one of my assistant coroners, Ian Potter, commenced an investigation into the death of Noreen McGlynn aged 89 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday. I made a determination of death by natural causes.","Noreen McGlynn developed a throat infection and a urinary tract infection at home and was prescribed amoxicillin by her general practitioner. She suffered an anaphylactic reaction to this and was admitted to hospital. The reaction was reversed, but she died three days later from her underlying conditions.

I recorded her medical cause of death as:

1a aspiration pneumonia
1b cerebrovascular disease and frailty of old age
2 anaphylaxis to penicillin.","I heard at inquest that, even before her anaphylaxis Ms McGlynn was waiting for an ambulance to take her to hospital. This was on the advice of two GPs and with the agreement of her daughter.

However, Noreen McGlynn’s family did not want her to go to hospital. They believed that she had a better chance of remaining well out of hospital. (The challenges that hospital admission present to the elderly are very well recognised.) And if she were now dying, family knew that Ms McGlynn would want to die at home. Her living situation was very supportive. She was a widow but she had an excellent full time carer and a loving, extremely engaged family, with her daughter living nearby.

The reason that family now favoured hospital admission was because Ms McGlynn had become so dehydrated. They recognised that this was life threatening and likely to make her feel unwell. If the rapid response team from the Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust who visited, or the GPs from Mountfield Surgery, had been able to offer rehydration at home, this would have been a far preferable course of action for Noreen McGlynn and for her loved ones.

Could such rehydration at home have been offered?
Could it be offered to others in the future?"

Dreelan,Birmingham and Solihull,HM Prison & Probation Service,"On 15 August 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gavin James Wheale. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was;

It is the unanimous opinion of the jury that Mr Wheale did die due to mixed drug interactions. Additionally, the events examined in this inquest highlight shortcomings in the following areas at the time of Mr Wheale's death:

1. The training of custodial and medical staff at HMP Birmingham in the implementation of policies and procedures designed to facilitate the arrival, processing and housing of prisoners considered 'at risk' or vulnerable. This had no impact on Mr Wheale's death.

2. The lines of communication across custodial staff at HMP Birmingham concerning the effective transfer of information pertinent to the health and wellbeing of incoming prisoners. This had no impact on Mr Wheale's death.

3. The lines of communication between medical and custodial staff at HMP Birmingham concerning the effective transfer of information pertinent to the health and wellbeing of incoming prisoners. This had no impact on Mr Wheale's death.

4. The facilities and resources in the reception area at HMP Birmingham pertaining to custodial staff's ability to monitor and supervise incoming prisoners, particularly those considered 'at risk' or vulnerable. This had no impact on Mr Wheale's death.

Conclusion of the jury as to the death: Drug related.","On 6/8/24, Gavin James Wheale was arrested on a recall to prison. He remained under constant supervision and handcuffed as he was suspected to be concealing an item. He was then transported by GeoAmey on 7/8/24 to HMP Birmingham. At 12.45, Mr Wheale was handed to HMP staff, where he was no longer handcuffed or under constant supervision. Mr Wheale provided a urine sample that tested positive for cocaine, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids and opiates. He began the body scanner process at 16.00 on 7/8/24, which came back as inconclusive. A short time later, Mr Wheale was seen waving a plastic bag in the air, which was empty, but said it had contained Diazepam, and he had taken it. He was then placed in a holding cell in the Care and Separation Unit (CSU). At 14.26 on 8/8/24, Mr Wheale was found unresponsive in his CSU cell. He was pronounced dead at 14.39.","1. At the time Mr Wheale resided in HMP Birmingham, HMP Birmingham Secreted Item Policy (January 2020) was in force. An updated policy was issued after Mr Wheale’s death (dated 8 2024). Both versions of the policy accept that ‘There is a clear risk to a prisoner’s health when an item is secreted internally’. My concern is that focus of the policy is the prevention of contraband entering the prison system and therefore it presupposes the outcome of the secreted item(s) being surrendered or disposed of by the prisoner. It does not provide clear guidance to staff on a situation, as with Mr Wheale, where an item previously concealed is then claimed to have been (or indeed a situation where it was witnessed to have been) removed and ingested without its previous packaging.

2. Evidence was heard from WMP and GEOAmey staff dealing with their required procedures where a person in their custody, in this instance Mr Wheale, was known or suspected of concealing items; both organisations required constant supervision and handcuffing. My concern is that upon handover to HMP Birmingham prisoners who have previously been under constant supervision, with their movement restricted, enter a regime with no equivalent levels of monitoring rendering HMP Birmingham unable to fully discharge their duty of care to that prisoner."

The investigation concluded on 5 June 2025 and the conclusion was one of narrative: Died from the complications of a fall when not being cared for in compliance with her risk assessment. The medical cause of death was 1a) Traumatic brain injury 1b) Fall II) Advanced dementia, frailty, E. coli septicaemia, bronchopneumonia.",Doreen Swann was a patient at Tameside General Hospital who had been medically optimised and was awaiting discharge when she developed a further infection. She was a high falls risk. She fell whilst unobserved and when the bed rails were up when they should not have been. She suffered a traumatic brain injury and died at Tameside General Hospital on 13 January 2025.,"1. The inquest heard evidence that Doreen Swann was only in hospital at the point of her fall because her discharge had been delayed due to a shortage of a suitable social care placement. The evidence was that nursing/caring for high falls risk patients in an acute setting is challenging and resource intensive.

2. The evidence given to the inquest was that this delayed discharge and the ongoing risk it presents was not an isolated incident at TGH - as an example the evidence given was that there were regularly 30 plus patients with a delayed discharge over 3 weeks due to a lack of social care beds. The evidence indicated that this challenge was not unique to Tameside.

3. The evidence indicated that managing a falls risk and the consequential risk to life is better managed outside an acute setting once the clinical need for a hospital stay has passed.

4. Delayed discharges such as Doreen Swann’s reduces the availability of beds for other patients and creates a knock-on impact across the hospital, particularly in relation to the Emergency Department."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased died on 26 December 2024 as a consequence of a fall that occurred on 4 October 2024 at Howlish Hall Care Home.","The Deceased had been a resident of Howlish Hall Care Home since February 2023. During her time at Howlish Hall the Deceased suffered a number of falls. In or about August 2023 the home manager received advice from the Community Falls Service, who recommended that a sensor box be placed in the Deceased’s bedroom and that the Deceased should use hip protectors, which could be purchased by the Deceased’s family. The home did not follow these recommendations and did not inform the family of the option to purchase hip protectors.
Following the family reporting concerns to social services, a social worker attended at the home on 27 September 2024. The home staff assured the social worker that they had a sensor mat that they would place next to the Deceased’s bed, but this was not done. On 4 October 2024 the Deceased suffered an unwitnessed fall in her room and sustained a fractured left hip. She underwent surgery to fix the fracture on 6 October 2024. She was discharged back to the home on 11 October 2024. Due to ongoing family concerns the Deceased was moved to a different care home on 3 December 2024. Her condition deteriorated and she died as a consequence of the hip fracture on 26 December 2024.","(1) Despite recommendations for falls prevention equipment being made by the Community Falls Service in August 2023, no falls prevention equipment was put in place by the time of the Deceased’s fall in October 2024.

(2) Despite the social worker expressing concern about the lack of falls prevention equipment on 27 September 2024, no falls equipment was put in place prior to the Deceased’s fall on 4 October 2024.

(3) Information about the Community Falls Service recommendations was not passed on to the family, or to social services.

(4) On 5 August 2024 (following a fall, but before the more significant fall on 4 October 2024), the Deceased’s family were told by the Deputy Manager of Howlish Hall that the owner of Howlish Hall “probably wouldn’t want to pay for a sensor mat”.

(5) I received evidence that, subsequent to the Deceased’s death, there had been a reluctance on the part of [REDACTED] (who was believed to be the owner of Howlish Hall Care Home) to provide adequate resources for falls prevention equipment.

(6) Despite it being recognised that the Deceased lacked mental capacity to make decisions about where she lived and was unable to keep herself safe, it appears that the home did not make any application for a DoLS assessment for the Deceased. Indeed I received evidence that when a new home manager was appointed at Howlish Hall in January 2025 none of the residents were subject to a DoLS, despite a large number of the residents lacking mental capacity."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

See narrative conclusion","Mr Paul Ransom sadly died on 24 May 2023 on the A272 between Meon Hut and Petersfield, approaching the village of Langrish, Hampshire. A 40 mph speed limit applied. He lost control of his motorcycle whilst doing up to around 45 mph and crossed into the oncoming carriageway, colliding with a lorry and sustaining the multiple injuries that caused his death. Conditions were excellent: full daylight, sunny and dry. Surfacing work had been completed less than six hours before the collision. The surface was very slippery and this caused or at least substantially contributed to the collision.","The resurfacing that had been carried out was an asphalt preservation treatment known as a “thin surface treatment” wherein a bituminous solution is cold sprayed onto the surface, overlaid with a silicate grit. This is a commonly used method. I heard evidence that in the initial period after laying thin surface treatment has a particular property (“early life effects”) in dry conditions the level of friction available can be akin to that of a wet road. There is no guidance that signage be provided. There is also the potential for unpredictable vehicle behaviour, particularly at lower speeds or when road surface temperatures are high, by reason of a change in the level of friction available to a vehicle during a steering manoeuvre or braking. This may have a greater effect on motorcycles.

The newly applied surface looks like an ordinary tarmac road albeit pristine.

There has been research into accident rates following application of thin surface treatments. The research had the effect of allaying concerns but I was informed that the research may not have been able to look specifically at motorcycle accidents, and further informed that the issue of signage has been the subject of discussion in at least some highways authorities. Thin surface treatments are to be distinguished from surface dressing wherein aggregates are applied, following which loose chipping warning signs are usually erected and a reduced speed limit applied for the days following application.

Following thin surface treatment the drivers of vehicles, including motorcycles are likely to assume that in dry conditions the road surface is going to have the same properties as any established dry asphalt road surface.

I am concerned that where the road is, for example, downhill and/or twisting and/or with limited sight lines then it may be a particular problem if speeds are not adapted for the early life properties of thin surface treatments: particularly in the case of motorcycles.

I recommend review of actions to be taken for the safety of road users, particularly motorcycles, following application of thin surface treatments, during the early life phase following thin surface treatment."

Griffin,Dorset,Secretary of State for the Home Department; Secretary of State for Health,"On 16 April 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Jairus Joshua Timothy Earl, born on 8 June 2008, who was aged 15 years at the time of his death.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 July 2025.

The medical cause of death was:

Ia Fatal shotgun injury to the head

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.","Jairus was 15 years old when he died on 14 April 2024. He had a history of mental ill health and had been under the care of his General Practitioner, a Chartered Psychologist and a Consultant in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He had disclosed to them thoughts of ending his life and although he had no plans to do so, he had talked about methods of doing this which included shooting.

His father, who Jairus resided with, was a shotgun licence holder. Jairus enjoyed outdoor life and would go out with his father and other family members shooting.

The family resided in London, which is where the shotgun licence was held, however they had another home in Dorset.

At the end of March 2024, the family travelled to Dorset to spend some time together at their home in Dorset. They took with them a number of shotguns which were then placed in a secure cabinet at the home address in Dorset. Dorset Police were not advised of the location of these guns in the Dorset area as there is no current legal requirement to notify the force where additional places of residence may be.

On 14 April 2024 Jairus and his father were due to return to their home in London and were closing down the property. Jairus’ father was in the process of packing the guns into his car to transport them to London when Jairus went into the office at the property where he used one of the shotguns to end his life.","(1) I have concerns in relation to gaps in the regulation of shotgun licences especially when a licence holder has more than one property where the guns may be used or stored. The Firearms Act 1968 (The Act) is the primary legislation that governs the possession and handling of firearms. This is supported by statutory guidance, Firearms Licensing: Statutory Guidance for Chief Officers of Police and non-statutory Home Office guidance, Guide on Firearms Licensing Law.

Section 2 of the Act deals with the requirement of certificate for possession of shotguns. Evidence was given at the Inquest by Acting Chief Inspector [REDACTED] of Dorset Police who works within the Dorset Firearms and Explosive Licensing Unit and also works with the College of Policing and the national Firearms & Explosive Licensing Working Group to review and update the Home Office statutory guidance and support the national training effort in response to the Prevention of Future Deaths report from the Inquest touching upon the deaths in Keyham on 12.8.2021.

He gave evidence that the regulation for shotguns is different to the regulations for firearms which is governed by Section 1 of The Act. There seems to be a great deal of difference in the regulation of firearms and the regulation of shotguns, however both can equally cause death.

I am concerned that the lack of regulation around shotguns could lead to future deaths. For example, he explained that there is no obligation on a licence holder of a shotgun licence to notify the approving force they are moving to or visiting another property

In his written evidence to the Court, which was further expanded on orally at the Inquest, he explained:

“Under section 26B(1) of the 1968 Act, an application for the grant of a shotgun shall be made to the chief officer of police where the applicant resides, there is nothing within the Firearms Act to define a residence or when applicants have properties in different force areas, the non-statutory guide tells me that where an applicant has residences in different force areas, it is for the individual to decide which force issues their certificate.

Shotgun certificates are issued by individual forces and will display the force crest and signature of the chief officer of the issuing force, however they are valid throughout England and Wales, and allow the holder to travel with their shotguns anywhere in the United Kingdom.

…

Shotgun certificates differ from firearm certificates in a number of ways, for firearms, possession of each and every gun must satisfy individual good reason, whereas a good reason for a shotgun is a collective term, and more relaxed, for example a request for a firearms certificate for target shooting will require that the applicant is a member of a Home Office approved club and shoots regularly, whereas a mere intention to undertake clay pigeon shooting would satisfy good reason for a shotgun certificate.

A shotgun certificate also will also authorise a person to have in their possession, purchase or acquire an unlimited number of shotguns without the need for approval in respect of individual guns, that is to say that so long as the shotguns are stored securely a person may have as many as they want.

Another nuance of the shotgun certificate is the ‘72-hour rule’ that it will allow a certificate holder to borrow a shotgun for up to 72 hours without the need to have to record the shotgun on the certificate or notify the police of the transfer.

…

Section 28(2)(a) of the 1968 Act provides that a shotgun certificate is granted subject to any prescribed conditions, and no others, that is that these conditions must be applied to the certificate, but the chief officer cannot add additional conditions.
….

There is no onus on an applicant to notify another force area where they hold a certificate and have another address in that force area, this is only the case if the certificate holder changes their permanent address that this would be captured by the third condition.

There is also no obligation on a certificate holder to notify a chief officer of police when they intend to visit another force area in possession of their shotguns.

Acting Chief Inspector [REDACTED] explained that on the Tuesday following Jairus’ death he briefed the national coordinator from the Firearms & Explosive Licensing Working Group to raise matters arising from the circumstances of Jairus’ death so there is awareness of the issues relating to second homes, however, there is no legal requirement for second homes to be declared by licence holders.

He further told the Court that in 2015, HM Inspection of Firearms Licensing recommended that forces must have a notification system on their local records to identify addresses and people where firearms are held. He explained that these systems are local rather than national and his recommendation to the Firearms & Explosive Licensing Working Group following Jairus’s death was that where an applicant declares a second home, the force where that home is located should be notified.

Dorset Police have taken action and put a system in place that when they are notified of the above, they will create a record on their system to flag the address as if that were a Dorset certificate holder, however it is not a legal requirement for forces to do this, and it is unknown if other forces nationally are doing this.

I therefore have concerns there is a lack of a system of sharing and flagging information between police forces regarding shotgun licence holders and the location of shotguns, which could lead to future deaths.

Accordingly, emergency services may attend an address where shotguns are held without knowledge of that fact due to the lack of a marker being placed on the address. This causes a risk to all those attending unmarked addresses as they would potentially be ill prepared for what they could face which could lead to future deaths.

Additionally failing to have such markers on additional homes means that if the police are called to the address for other reasons such as a concern for welfare, they may miss the opportunity to put in place additional security measures, or even revoke the licence, as required for the safety of the occupants at the address, and others. Evidence was heard that Dorset Police were called to Jairus’s family address in Dorset on 28.3.2024 following a report that Jairus was missing. It was not apparent from the police system at the time that there would be shotguns at the address. Jairus’s mental health was discussed during the report of this incident. Had the flag system been in place then, consideration could have been given to the continued possession of the shotgun in a property where Jairus could access them.

(2) Further I have a concern around the access that police forces have to medical information about other persons living at the same property as the applicant, or at their second homes, when considering firearm and shotgun licence applications. Acting Chief Inspector [REDACTED] advised the Court that whilst police forces can look at the medical history of the applicant and can speak to others present at the address, they have no legal right to access the medical records of others residing at the property.

The medical history of Jairus came as great surprise to the attending police officers at the Inquest. I am concerned that the lack of access to this medical information of others residing at the address of a licence applicant, especially in relation to mental health, when considering firearms or shotgun licence applications could lead to future deaths."

Didcock,Nottinghamshire,"The Chief Executive, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust","On 23 August 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mrs Gemma Louise Poterajko

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 June 2025

The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative as follows:

Gemma died from a rare, unexpected, but recognised complication of a pacemaker lead extraction. She died from multi organ failure caused by catastrophic haemorrhage from two venous tears in the left innominate vein and left subclavian vein, sustained during the lead extraction.
No identified issues of care have, on balance, caused or made a more than minimal, negligible or trivial contribution to her death.","Gemma died on 22.8.24 at the City Hospital in Nottingham following a pacemaker lead extraction procedure. During the advancement of the Tightrail cutting sheath used to cut through fibrous scar tissue surrounding the lead, to aid lead extraction, the cutting blades likely caused two tears in the wall of the left subclavian and left innominate veins. These tears occurred at sometime between 14.35 and Gemma’s collapse with low blood pressure at 14.48 hours on that day.
Whilst the exact mechanism of venous tearing is unclear, and is a very unusual occurrence, the vein walls were likely to be additionally vulnerable because of the stuck fibrous tissue around the pacemaker lead also being stuck to the vein inner wall. No evidence of careless or incorrect technique has been established to have led to these tears.
Bleeding from these tears was catastrophic, likely the most significant bleed being from the higher tear in the subclavian vein, where the Tightrail sheath was found protruding from the vein at 16.55 hours. The first venous tear was found at 16.11 hours.
Managing events from 14.48 onwards was challenging for the team of senior clinicians present, as there was a need to search for and potentially deal with, a more common bleeding site, that is from the right atrium or from a superior vena cava tear, before a higher venous tear was considered.
Rendering all appropriate resuscitative measures, including cardiopulmonary bypass was necessary before further bleeding sites were searched for, as Gemma had such a profound circulatory collapse with a cardiac arrest at 15.00 hours requiring ongoing cardiac compressions and full and continuing advanced life support.
The extent of bleeding from the venous tears was likely unsurvivable once it had occurred, although it was entirely appropriate to continue all measures to try and save Gemma’s life up until sadly the situation was futile with evidence of established multi organ failure later that evening.","1. The lack of a formalised documented system of risk stratification for lead extraction. The consequence is that there is a lack of clear planning for what may be needed from the cardiac surgical team, in terms of urgent surgical expertise, theatre staff support and perfusion team support, for any given lead extraction.

2. The lack of a written trust standard operating procedure for lead extraction that includes a record of the planning discussion, and sets out realistic cardiac surgical involvement when this is necessary.

3. The lack of clarity as to how the full cardiac surgical team can within their resources currently, or planned for, provide necessary attendance in a timely way at a given lead extraction procedure, as per international expert consensus.

I am not reassured that necessary actions to address these serious issues identified are in place."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: NATURAL CAUSES","Peter Ramsden had a past medical history of hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidaemia, poor mobility and chronic alcohol excess. He had not been seen for approximately two months by his neighbours who became concerned about his welfare. Entry to his unlocked premises took place on 2 January 2025 where he was found deceased and in an advanced state of decomposition. There were no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement surrounding his death. Whilst no named specific disease process can be identified to account for his death, on balance, it was due to a natural disease process.","Evidence was heard that there is a lacuna in the law, specifically relating to section 17 of the Police & Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) which grants police officers the power to enter and search premises without a warrant in specific situations. These include, inter alia, entry for arrest and emergency situations which allows entry to save life or limb or prevent serious damage to a property. In this particular case, evidence was heard that this man had not been seen for two months and there were concerns about his welfare and paramedics attended on one occasion but have no powers of entry. Due to the Right Care, Right Person model, which has been developed over the last few years, the police did not get involved, as it was thought by the concerned individual that this man not being seen was due to a medical problem. Evidence was heard which suggested that on occasions, the ambulance service and the fire service should have powers of entry in the event that a person who is ill, unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, with a remediable disorder, can receive prompt and potentially life-saving treatment. In this case, causation would not have been established as the man has been dead for several weeks, but situations could and will arise where time-sensitive pathological processes require emergency treatment to save life."

Reeves,London South,Emergency Call Prioritisation Advisory Group; London Ambulance Service NHS Trust,"On 15 February 2023, an inquest was opened, and an investigation commenced, into the death of Miles Brian Robinson, who was aged 66 at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, which was heard over 3 days between 4 and 6 June 2025.","In the early hours of the morning on 19 December 2022, Miles Robinson started to have chest pains and was vomiting. He had multiple co-morbidities including end-stage renal failure, hypertension, heart failure and pleural effusion. His granddaughter called 999 at 03:37. Due to extreme demand on the London Ambulance Service (“LAS”), there was a significant delay in that call and a later 999 call being answered and there were significant delays in allocation and dispatch of ambulances. The 999 call was incorrectly triaged and received an inaccurate categorisation of the urgency of the response required.

Having been informed that an emergency ambulance was not immediately required and of the wait times for an ambulance, Mr Robinson made his own way in an Uber to the nearest urgent treatment centre (“UTC”) at Queen Mary’s Hospital. Upon arrival, he had a cardiac arrest. This was due to a massive myocardial infarction. After prolonged CPR and shocks by staff at the UTC and attending LAS paramedics, a return of spontaneous circulation was achieved at 05:04.

Mr Robinson was then transferred by ambulance to the local emergency department at Princess Royal University Hospital (“PRUH”). He had two further cardiac arrests shortly before and after his arrival at PRUH, which were fatal. He died at 06:36 on 19 December 2022.","In the UK, 999 calls are triaged using one of two approved triage tools (also referred to as call prioritisation systems) approved by NHS England: the Medical Priority Dispatch System (“MPDS”) and NHS Pathways. LAS uses MPDS. The MPDS looks at signs and symptoms and prioritises them into dispatch codes, which assign a level of priority to the call, and in turn inform the type of ambulance resource that will be allocated to manage the incident.

MPDS is designed for use by non-clinical call handlers. MPDS involves a system of structured questions which identify priority symptoms and thereby the clinical need of patients. The structured questions fall into different protocols and a patient can be shunted, or moved, between one protocol and another depending on the answers to specific questions. In these circumstances, and for sound operational reasons, there is necessarily an element of rigidity in the MPDS.

In Mr Robinson’s case, LAS accepted that the first 999 call was incorrectly triaged and received an inaccurate categorisation of the urgency of the response required: it was allocated a Category 3 (urgent) rather than Category 2 (emergency) response. Given the rigidity of the structured questions, there was no capacity within MPDS to account for information provided on behalf of Mr Robinson during the first 999 call, namely that he thought and felt like he was having a heart attack. The evidence heard at the inquest was that: (1) there are no individual MPDS determinants, under the relevant protocol, Protocol 10 (Chest Pain), that are specific for a heart attack; and (2) under the MPDS this information (reporting a heart attack) would not result in a dispatch code justifying a Category 1 (life threatening) response, with an average response time of 7 minutes and 90% of calls responded to within 15 minutes.

This means that for a patient who is conscious and breathing, but reporting a heart attack, the highest possible category of emergency response on the MPDS Chest Protocol is Category 2 (average response 18 minutes; 90% calls within 40 minutes). However, this rigidity and categorisation may give rise to a risk of future death, namely: the risk their heart attack leads to a cardiac arrest immediately or shortly following the cessation of the call, and because they are on their own, they are unable to re-call 999; and/or the cardiac arrest may cause their death prior to a Category 2 (or subsequent Category 1) ambulance arriving at their location. This risk also arises in the context of increasing nationwide demand on UK ambulance services which has given rise to delays in allocation and dispatch of ambulances."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative as follows:

Box 3:
Liliwen Thomas’s mother was admitted to the University Hospital of Wales for induction of labour on 8 October 2022 at 40+1 weeks. On 9 October she was given analgesia, Entonox and pethidine. Into the early hours of 10 October, Liliwen’s mother was not attended to, or subjected to physical checks/examinations, regularly enough for her progress to active labour to be recognised. At 02:14 staff attended and found that Liliwen had been delivered unattended. Liliwen was in a very poor condition. She died at 22:40 the same day. A postmortem examination concluded that she died due to asphyxia around the time of her birth exacerbated by the presence of congenital infection and abnormal perfusion of the placenta of which there were no clinical indications identified before birth.

Box 4:
Liliwen died from a hypoxic brain injury following an unattended delivery in hospital. This was contributed to by:
a. Her mother not being attended to as frequently, or subject to as regular physical checks/examinations, as she should have been and her progress to active labour not being recognised;
b. The effects of maternal pethidine administered during labour;
c. Liliwen’s mother suffering an exaggerated pharmacological response to therapeutic doses of the drugs codeine and pethidine in combination with Entonox;
d. The absence of resuscitation at birth;
e. Bacterial infection and malperfusion of the placenta.

Liliwen’s cause of death was found to be:

1a Perinatal asphyxia

1b Congenital bacterial infection and maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta

a. The learning from Liliwen’s death, surrounding maternal analgesia during induction and labour; and

Saunders,Coventry,The Chief Executive Officer of the College of Policing; The Chief Constable of West Midlands Police,"This investigation concerns the death of Mr Fitzgerald, who was fatally shot by a West Midlands Police (“WMP”) officer (known as Officer K) on 4 January 2019 during an armed operation at a residential address in Coventry. The investigation commenced on 10 January 2019 and concluded at the end of an inquest hearing on 21 May 2025.","On 4 January 2019, Sean Fitzgerald was at a house at [REDACTED] in Coventry. A team of police firearms officers from West Midlands Police arrived at the house to perform a search warrant. At shortly after 6.20pm, officers at the front of the house began using a chainsaw to break down the front door. At this point, Sean Fitzgerald went to the back door, opened it and emerged. A police firearms officer in position about 7.5 feet from the back door discharged his firearm towards Sean Fitzgerald. The shot struck him in the chest and caused serious internal injuries. Despite prompt first aid from police officers and from paramedics and a doctor, it was not possible to resuscitate him, and he died of the gunshot wound. He was declared dead at 6.55pm.","(1) Training and practice in relation to timing of any announcement of “armed police” in police firearms operations involving containment of properties

In the police operation in which Mr Fitzgerald was killed, the officers employed the tactic of “contain and call out with limited entry.” This involves firearms officers “containing” a property by surrounding it and providing firearms cover with their weapons; creating a breach by forcing entry; and “calling out” the subjects inside (directing them to leave through the point of breach), without the officers themselves entering. In evidence, it was explained that this is a very common tactic, which is used in a range of scenarios.

[REDACTED], a former senior firearms officer and armed policing lead within the College of Policing, gave evidence in the inquest. He explained that an integral part of the tactic is for officers to announce their presence by loud shouts of “armed police.” This warns those inside the property that it is the police forcing entry and informs them that the officers are armed. It was explained that this warning helps to avoid confusion and encourage compliance, thereby reducing the risk of harm to officers and occupants. The timing of the announcement is plainly important, and any potential for confusion or for making the announcement at the wrong time risks fatal consequences.

[REDACTED] said that the timing of any such announcement is not prescribed by national training or guidance, and that there is no “template” for when it should be done, although he understood that it would usually be made after achieving a breach (e.g. breaking down a door). The procedural and training documents (both national and from WMP) which were put in evidence in the inquest gave no detailed guidance on the subject. The Chief Firearms Instructor at WMP, [REDACTED], gave evidence that WMP trains its officers to make the announcement after achieving a breach.

The evidence of the officers involved in the operation as to the recommended or standard practice was inconsistent. The Strategic Firearms Commander said that he expected officers to announce themselves as armed police as soon as they were in position. The Operational Firearms Commander said that the shout should first be made as soon as the chainsaw was being applied to the door and again as the breach was made. One further member of the team said that he thought best practice was to give the shout as the chainsaw was being applied, but he acknowledged that he had not done so on this occasion. Several other members of the team thought that proper practice was only to make the announcement after the door had been breached.

The firearms briefing told the officers that method of entry would be conducted and “[o]nce breached, challenges will be made at the threshold and suspects will be handcuffed”. There was no further discussion or direction about when the officers should first announce their presence.

In the event, the officers at the front of the property did not shout “armed police” before breaking down the two doors at the front of the property. Before any announcement was made, Mr Fitzgerald left through the rear door of the premises and was shot by Officer K, who was providing rear containment.

In these circumstances, I am concerned that the guidance and training given to firearms officers on tactics of containing and entering properties (and specifically in relation to the containment and call out with limited entry tactic) does not ensure a clear and consistent understanding of when they should announce their presence, or what factors to consider in deciding when to make the announcement. I am also concerned that the topic was not the subject of more specific discussion or direction in the briefing.

It is important that officers conducting these kinds of highly challenging firearms operation should have proper guidance on this subject. If the approach of different officers is inconsistent, there is the clear potential for mistakes to be made and for the lives of officers and others to be put at risk. I appreciate that expert firearms training officers are best placed to produce any further guidance, and that it may not be possible to have a hard and fast rule. However, the inconsistent views of highly trained officers which were given in this inquest indicate that the subject ought to be further addressed in training and in formal guidance.

(2) Training and practice in relation to positioning of firearms officers in operations against properties (including consideration of the reactionary gap)

As set out above, in this case, Officer K was standing between 7 and 8 feet from the rear door of the property as Mr Fitzgerald left. He discharged his firearm within just over half a second of the door beginning to open. The jury found that he had acted lawfully, meaning that he had perceived a threat and had used force commensurate with the threat he perceived. They also found that he had acted reasonably in taking up the position which he took, given the briefing he had received. Nevertheless, the evidence at the inquest gave cause for concern in relation to the training and guidance given to firearms officers on how they should position themselves in operations against properties.

In the inquest, two experts in cognition and perception, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], explained that close proximity to a potential source of danger can have a psychological impact, significantly elevating a person’s perception of threat and potentially increasing the likelihood that they will respond with force. The experts considered that, in this case, such proximity was likely to have heightened Officer K’s perception of threat.

The inquest heard evidence about the concept of the “reactionary gap”, a distance which officers are often trained to maintain between themselves and a subject who presents a threat. In evidence, [REDACTED] discussed this concept, explaining that distance gives officers more time to assimilate information and respond to an approaching threat. He explained that maintaining a reactionary gap prevents officers from being “closed down” by subjects. He said that officers are trained on the importance of distance in the context of containment tactics.

The firearms training and guidance materials considered in evidence made limited reference to positioning and the reactionary gap. The WMP training materials required students to demonstrate an appropriate reactionary gap in one training exercise and to explain its importance in another. The College of Policing’s Authorised Professional Practice on Armed Containment described the benefit of distance, but in terms of reducing stress, tension and the likelihood of a close quarter confrontation. None of the materials gave any detailed consideration to the risks presented by close proximity (including close proximity to entrances rather than subjects) in the context of armed containment of properties. None explained the potential impact of proximity on threat perception and the likelihood that an officer will respond with potentially lethal force.

I am concerned that the training and guidance given to firearms officers on how to position themselves, especially in operations against properties, does not include detailed consideration of the risks of taking up position in close proximity to entrances. It does not appear to address the effects of proximity on threat perception and the use of force.

As with the first matter of concern, I recognise that it should be for expert firearms training officers to decide how to deal with this subject in training and guidance, and that there will inevitably be situations where a firearms officer has to take up position very close to a doorway or other entrance when containing a property. However, there appears to be a need for further consideration of this issue in the interest of minimising the risks of mistake of fact shootings in the future.

Finally, I should stress that in raising this matter of concern, I am not detracting from the jury’s conclusions that Officer K’s use of force was lawful and that his decision on where to position himself was reasonable in light of the briefing and intelligence."

Marks,East Riding of Yorkshire and Kingston-upon-Hull,Chief Executive of NHS England,"On 11 June 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of John Michael Kirkman, aged 36 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: SUICIDE","John Michael Kirkman had a long history of paranoid schizophrenia which was difficult to control despite appropriate medication. He had a number of detentions and admissions pursuant to various sections of the Mental Health Act 1983. In the weeks leading up to his death, he is likely to have researched the toxicity of [REDACTED] products, and indeed, arranged for a number of packs of [REDACTED] to be purchased on his behalf. I have found that John was alive at 22:15 hours on 26 December 2023 and is likely to have ingested [REDACTED] some time between then and 03:00 hours on 27 December. He is likely to have died around 07:51 hours on 27 December 2023. There was no realistic opportunity to have saved his life by the staff at the home. There were no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement surrounding his death. I have found that John knew that taking these [REDACTED] would result in death.","Evidence was heard that if a mental health screening assessment is carried out in one part of the country, the results and conclusions reached may not necessarily be immediately available in another part of the country, when a further assessment is carried out. Evidence suggested that such assessments capture important clinical information and the lack of availability of preceding data may adversely influence subsequent assessments. Screening may form the basis for onward referral for formal mental health assessments. Absence of vital background information could result in an incorrect prioritisation for onward referral as it did in this case. The situation is not ubiquitous but does occur due to the use of different IT systems in various institutions."

Simpson,Berkshire,CEO - Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust,"On 1 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Patrick Anthony Coffey aged 85. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

On 29 September 2024 Patrick Anthony Coffey died at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough. He fell at home on 12 September fracturing multiple ribs and remained on the floor until the following day contracting a chest infection. He was admitted to hospital for treatment but continued to deteriorate.","As a result of falling at home Mr Coffey fractured multiple ribs and remained on the floor for about 17 hours. On arrival at hospital he was found to have contracted a chest infection. He suffered from COPD which did not usually affect his life and he was mobile prior to the fall.

He was assessed in hospital and it was decided to treat the fractures conservatively. This required effective pain control which was not always offered or achieved. He did undergo 2 periods of local anaesthesia infusions which were more effective in controlling the pain. He was treated with antibiotics for the chest infection throughout his stay.","I heard evidence that it was important that Mr Coffey spent most of his time in a seated position rather than lying down. This was to assist with his ability to breathe more deeply and cough more effectively; both of which are of importance when treating chest infections especially in the context of a patient with rib fractures.

The nursing witness for the trust confirmed that Mr Coffey should have been repositioned every 2-4 hours. It had been identified by the hospital during random monthly audits that this was either not being done or not being properly recorded for some patients.

Frimley Trust, after the inquest concluded, provided confirmation of when Mr Coffey’s position was recorded during his stay. These reveal that on certain days almost no information is recorded and on other days it is possible to know his position on a 2-4 hourly basis.

Of particular note is the following:
1. There is no record of his position from 16.39 on 15/9/2024 to 06.51 on 16/9/2024,
2. The only record between 19.11 on 16/9/2024 and 04.18 on 18/9/2024 is one entry at 06.23 on 17/9/2024
3. The only record between 22.26 on 18/9/2024 and 01.51 on 20/9/2024 is one entry at 10.34 on 19/9/2024
4. There are only 2 entries for 22/9/2024 at 06.06 and 22.11
5. The entries for 24/9/2024 cease at 14.08 and they do not restart until 12.24 on 25/9/2024
6. The last entry on 25/9/2024 is at 14.35 and the next entry is not until 17.59 on 26/9/2024
7. The final entry on 26/9/2024 is at 20.54 and the first entry on 27/9/2024 is at 10.03.

These records therefore have gaps of up to 27 hours.

In addition the vast majority of records that do exist do not reveal whether Mr Coffey was actually repositioned as only one position is recorded. It is only on about 7 or 8 occasions that a repositioning has been recorded.

The medical records from the hospital do not show repositioning every 2-4 hours and I found that Mr Coffey was probably not repositioned as required. In the particular circumstances of Mr Coffey this did not contribute to his death; lack of repositioning does give rise to a risk of future deaths of those suffering from chest infections or, indeed, those particularly at risk of pressure damage."

Rookes,Avon,Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE),"On 3 December 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of David Stewart Gifford. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was:

Natural causes

The cause of death was recorded as:

1a Ruptured thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm
1b Fractured stent and endoleak
1c Aortic dissection and multiple aortic aneurysms - stented","David Gifford had an extensive medical history with significant co-morbidities. He had a long cardiac history which included aortic dissection, multiple aortic aneurysms and heart failure. He first underwent surgery for aortic dissection in 2006.

He subsequently underwent further surgery on multiple occasions for further stenting and grafting to repair additional ruptures to his aorta. He developed an endoleak which was monitored and remained stable for many years, until it required surgery in 2023.

Mr Gifford died on 26 November 2024 at Southmead Hospital. His death was caused by an acute ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, following the development of a fractured stent and endoleak at some point in the weeks preceding his death. It was not clear for exactly how long this endoleak had been present, or when the fracture occurred.

In the weeks before his death, Mr Gifford had had multiple visits to his GP surgery. He was a complex patient with a number of medical conditions and he had been experiencing a range of symptoms. The clinicians he saw referred him for further investigations into his symptoms.

In the afternoon of 25 November 2024, Mr Gifford made a 999 call to the ambulance due to right-sided neck pain which radiated down his back and to his flank. He had been experiencing this pain since August 2024. Paramedics attended in the evening, and after an assessment, they did not think he needed to be conveyed to hospital. Worsening advice was given which resulted in Mr Gifford calling 999 again late that evening and an ambulance arrived in the early hours of 26 November 2024. He was conveyed to hospital and then transferred to Southmead Hospital, where he lost cardiac output whilst still on the trolley.

There were concerns raised about recognition of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and its rupture. Whilst training and knowledge focuses on identification of any ‘red flag symptoms’, it is well known that a number of AAAs do not present in this way, resulting in a group of patients who are challenging to diagnose, and who may be missed.","(1) Training and knowledge focuses on the classic signs and symptoms associated with an AAA. However, there are a group of patients who will not present in this way, and who may be challenging to diagnose. Whilst there may be many medical conditions that could be similar, there does not seem to be much focus given to the identification of vascular emergencies within training and knowledge updates. Therefore when paramedics attend emergencies, in the absence of classic symptoms, they may be wrongly reassured. Where a person has an extensive aortic history, the importance of aortic pathology should be considered.

(2) There has not been training or medical education for ambulance on vascular emergencies for a long time. The evidence was that JRCALC guidelines did recently highlight the number of patients that may not present with the traditional ‘red flags’ but did not provide further guidance. This is a national issue where ambulance staff should be knowledgeable about the more subtle signs of vascular emergencies that may be missed."

Rookes,Avon,Secretary of State for Health & Social Care,"On 27 August 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Sarah Jayne Lewis. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest today, on 7 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was:

Suicide","In 2014, Sarah Lewis was diagnosed with Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Ms Lewis’ ME was severe and as a result of her condition, she experienced severe and debilitating symptoms. This had a huge effect on her quality of life, and left her for the most part bedbound. It also impacted on her ability to seek professional support or be supported due to sensory sensitivity and aversion to visiting, or being visited. Ms Lewis had a history of anxiety and depression but this complex multisystem condition resulted in a deterioration of her mental health and left her wishing that she was no longer alive.

On 8 August 2024, it was Severe ME Awareness Day. Ms Lewis was found deceased at home on 9 August 2024 but as she had not been seen for 2 days, it is likely she died the day before, on a day which was significant for her. Her death was caused by her taking an overdose of [REDACTED] with the intention of ending her own life. By ending her own life, she also ended the profound physical and mental suffering that she had endured.","(1) Despite ME having received some more recent attention, the provision of ME services around the country remains inconsistent. I understand that there are still areas where there is no provision. The evidence revealed that a very important first stage for ME sufferers is that they receive a diagnosis and validation for their severe symptoms. Without provision of a service, there remains a risk that this will not occur. I was told that there is still a belief by some that ME is not real and this has a profoundly negative effect on sufferers and their ability to seek support.

(2) Historically, there has been little research into ME. As a result of this, nobody knows what causes it, and there is therefore no cure. Whilst I note there has been a small investment recently in research, I was told that this is not enough, and that a perception remains about ME not being real. The resultant effect is that some ME sufferers have no hope that their symptoms will ever improve.

(3) Other professionals do not understand ME, what it is or the symptoms it causes. This can be a barrier to those with ME receiving support, or accessing care/treatment they need. A hospital passport is now being utilised at North Bristol, which assists sufferers. However, it is not clear that this is being used in all areas, and there remains a lack of understanding about ME. Education and training about this has not been prioritised.

(4) NICE issued update guidance relatively recently but it is not clear whether this has been fully considered or implemented by commissioning bodies around the country."

Brennan,Greater Manchester West,"Chief Constable, Greater Manchester Police; Chief Constable, College of Policing","On 31 March 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Elaine Tarbuck aged 69. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 June 2025.

The medical cause of death was:

1a) Exsanguination
1b) Scalp laceration
2) Ischaemic heart disease

I returned a narrative conclusion that Elaine Tarbuck died as the consequence of injuries sustained in an accidental fall and the exacerbating effects of pre-existing naturally occurring disease on a background of sub-optimal emergency response.","The deceased had a medical history that included Multiple Myeloma with reducing mobility, a history of falls (previous pelvic fracture in 11/2024) and low mood, depression and anxiety following the recent death of her husband. Such was the nature and extent of concern for welfare, her next-of-kin (who resided a long distance from the deceased) would telephone the deceased several times in the day and had also arranged for family friends to visit daily. She was last spoken to during the evening of 28/3/2025.

At about 9.40am on the morning of 29/3/2025, a friend of the deceased attended at her residence at [REDACTED] Westhoughton on a pre-arranged welfare visit. Upon obtaining no response from the deceased, he went to the nearest police station to report his concerns. Little Hulton Police Station was unmanned and closed, but public signage giving advice resulted in a call to the police ‘101’ non-emergency contact line. The concerned friend was instructed that the matter was a welfare and not a policing matter.

At 11.52am having confirmed from family and neighbours that the deceased had not been seen and was still not responding to telephone calls to her, the emergency services were contacted via a ‘999’ call. Call handlers determined that an ambulance should attend. Emergency paramedics arrived on scene at 12.18pm but could not gain access to the deceased’s property. The Fire Service was therefore requested to attend.

Following a forced entry via rear patio doors at 12.50pm the deceased was discovered in a collapsed, unresponsive condition at the foot of the stairs laying in a pool of dried blood from an obvious head injury. She was verified as dead and beyond any attempted resuscitation.

The evidence established that after setting the house alarms and heading up the stairs for bed during the preceding evening, the deceased had missed her footing or lost her balance, falling backwards from about three stairs up, landing in a way that caused her to lose immediate consciousness and having also sustained a laceration to her head, thereafter was to exsanguinate without regaining consciousness.

By reason of the time at which death could be established, it was determined that accepted suboptimal elements in the assessment, quality of questions asked of people contacting the police and emergency services and the resulting information gathering fell below the standard expected and applied as part of the ‘Right Care, Right Person’ response policy, this did not have any bearing upon the outcome.","During the Inquest, evidence was heard that:

1. Family members who lived far from the deceased became concerned for the welfare of the deceased and were of the view that she had suffered a medical episode, collapse or adverse event that explained her failure to respond to telephone calls and knocks on the door from friends.

2. The full background of the deceased, her history of falls, her recent bereavement and high risk to have suffered an adverse medical episode, or deliberate or unintended physical harm raised the expectation on the part of the family, that having called the emergency services, entry would be forced to the deceased’s residence as they were of the view that there was a real and immediate risk of death or serious harm having occurred.

3. In fact, calls to the non-emergency 101 and 999 emergency lines evaluated that this was a non-critical emergency and a presumed medical event. This created a significant delay before it was appreciated that entry would need to be forced and the Fire and Rescue Service were requested to attend.

4. There was lack of understanding as to whether the forced entry would be lawful, a matter for the police, or a matter for Fire and Rescue Services in circumstances that the next-of-kin, if asked, would have agreed readily to there being forced entry at the outset and well before their arrival.

5. There was accepted sub-optimal information gathering and evaluation of the category of this emergency with an example of poor training resulting in inappropriate language being used by a call handler.

6. The emergency response had come about because of a new ‘Right Care, Right Person’ policy applied by emergency services that, in fact, delivered as a first responder, the wrong person delivering the wrong care to the deceased’s residence.

7. Prior to the implementation of ‘Right Care, Right Person’ this ‘concern for welfare’ emergency would have been dealt with by the attendance of the police on the scene as first responders who would have been likely to have achieved entry as a result of the concern for welfare."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that recorded by the jury was that George's death was drug-related.,"Mr George Emmett died after taking synthetic cannabinoid in G-Wing at HMP Aylesbury on 25 May 2023. The death was verified by attending paramedics at 21:38 on that day. On 25 May 2023, George was last observed alive in his cell at 18:17.

There was a 12 minute period between being observed unresponsive at 20:34 on the floor of his cell and unlocking his cell at 20:46, after which resuscitation attempts followed, and an ambulance was dispatched at 20:48.

Paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 of the applicable Medical Emergency Response Codes, which relate to the summoning of emergency assistance, were only acted upon at 20:47.

Due to the ongoing effects of synthetic cannabinoid, it is not possible to ascertain the optimal time at which CPR would have been successful. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence that this lapse of time contributed to George's death.","During the evidence in person of Operational Support Grade (OSG) [REDACTED] he discussed his actions at the time of and after first seeing George on the floor in his cell. He was taken to sections of the national HMPPS Medical Emergency Response Codes policy which include:
5.2: Local procedures must ensure that staff understand they should not delay summoning emergency assistance. For example, it must not be a requirement for a member of the prison healthcare team or a duty manager to attend the scene before emergency services are called;
5.3 It is essential that an ambulance is called in all cases where there are serious concerns about the health of a prisoner and that access to both the prison and the individual prisoner is not delayed;
5.4: A representative NHS ambulance guide for use in the community states that an ambulance should be called when there are signs of chest pain, difficulty in breathing, unconsciousness, severe blood loss, severe burns or scalds, choking, fitting or concussion, severe allergic reactions or a suspected stroke. This must also be the case for prisoners and therefore, in these situations when the medical emergency is called over the radio network, an ambulance must be called immediately;
Paragraph 5.7 indicates a number of minimum requirements for local protocols, including to inform staff that if they are in any doubt about the nature of the injury, they must call an ambulance. It is better to act with caution and request an ambulance that can be cancelled if it is later assessed as not required.
The policy also describes the circumstances in which a ""Code Blue"" should be called including a prisoner who is unconscious.
Evidence at the inquest demonstrated a Code Blue should be called over the radio from the cell location where a situation such as that in which George was found has arisen.
The evidence of OSG [REDACTED] did not appear to demonstrate familiarity with the processes set out in this policy at the time of George's death, nor any greater familiarity during evidence given, some two years after George's death.
It is understood OSG [REDACTED] holds a similar role at HMP Woodhill.
There is a continuing concern that optimum reaction to an emergency situation involving the health of a prisoner may be compromised if OSG [REDACTED] were to react in a manner which was not in accordance with any local protocols reflective of this HMPPS Medical Emergency Response Codes policy.
The circumstances anticipated by this policy include situations where a prisoner's death may be prevented with appropriate application of an emergency response."

Persaud,London East,"Department of Health & Social Care; Clinical Effectiveness Group, Queen Mary's University of London","On 6 January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Daniel Norman Hatchett, aged 64 at the time of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 June 2025 with a conclusion of suicide.","Mr. Daniel Hatchett had no history of mental health diagnoses. In the last few years of his life he suffered a decline in his physical health (most notably due to dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation), which together with work stresses caused a decline in his mental health. He attended a holistic BUPA assessment in 12 2023. The BUPA report highlighted stress levels and a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation which required prompt attention. Both health concerns were reported to Mr. Hatchett’s general practitioner. In response to the BUPA report, Mr. Hatchett’s GP directed him to A&E to obtain urgent treatment for the atrial fibrillation. Treatment was provided by the A&E team in the form of anticoagulation. The GP surgery did not action the recommendation for primary care psychotherapy and/or follow-up of his mental health to address his levels of stress. Mr. Hatchett did not present to any of the healthcare professionals as being at risk of suicide or at risk of deliberate self-harm, but he was not expressly questioned about his mental health. There was a missed opportunity to refer him for therapy in 1 2024 and/or for the GP to follow up on Mr. Hatchett’s mental health. It is not possible to conclude on the balance of probabilities that this would have prevented his death in 11 2024. In the very early hours of the 9 11 2024 Mr. Hatchett was discovered hanging in his home address. Paramedics attended and pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended, investigated and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious.","1. Patients with chronic disease often present with concomitant mental health decline.
2. GP appointment timings are often insufficient for the necessary holistic review of this cohort of patients.
3. Templates for GPs, to assist them in reviewing patients with chronic disease, do not include a section for review of mental health. It was considered that such a requirement could assist in identifying patients whose mental health has been adversely affected by declining physical health. This would allow the opportunity for necessary mental health support to be offered to these patients.
4. The inquest heard that it is well known that middle aged men infrequently open up to their GP to express concerns about their mental health. An express question on a chronic disease review could help to elicit concerns that would otherwise remain undiscovered."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 June 2025.

The medical cause of death has been established on the evidence as follows

1a Pneumonia
1b Cystic Fibrosis
II Renal Failure (on dialysis)

The four questions - who, when, where and how – were answered as follows …

Jason James Clemens died on 23 March 2024 at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro from complications following cystic fibrosis contributed to by a delay in the administration of antibiotics from the time of prescription. Antibiotics were prescribed to be administered without delay at 18:15 hours on 22 March 2024. There was a 7-hour delay before antibiotics were administered at 01:00 hours on 23 March 2024. Jason became unresponsive at 05:00 hours and died at 06:30 hours on 23 March 2024.

There were a number of missed opportunities to identify the requirement to administer antibiotics. This delay likely hastened Jason’s death and more than minimally contributed to Jason’s cause of death.

The conclusion of the inquest was as follows

Natural causes contributed to by neglect.","There were four missed opportunities to administer antibiotics.

The inquest found that Jason was a highly vulnerable patient due to his complex medical conditions.

Jason suffered a medical episode during the afternoon of 22 March 2024 whilst attending an out-patient appointment at the renal unit of RCHT. Staff took clinical readings and requested a medical review which was completed by a renal registrar at 18:15 hours that day. The registrar gave instructions on Jason’s medical management plan which required a full sepsis screen and the immediate administration of antibiotics. This was reinforced by the registrar completing a without delay prescription of antibiotics on the digital system (known as EPMA).

Subsequently there were four missed opportunities to administer antibiotics before they were administered at 01:20 hours following day, 23 March 2024. Jason was found unresponsive at 05:00 and died at 06:30 on that day.

The four missed opportunities were as follows

1) The renal registrar did not verbally instruct the nursing team to administer antibiotics at 18:15 hours.
2) The renal unit nurses either disregarded or did not read the registrar review and the management plan and EPMA prescription requiring immediate administration of antibiotics.
3) At 22:15 there was a handover from renal unit to acute medical unit (AMU). The renal unit nurses did not record on the handover notes the requirement to administer antibiotics.
4) On handover the AMU nurses either disregarded or did not check the management plan and EPMA prescription requiring the administration of antibiotics.

The error was discovered on registrar review in the AMU at 00:10 hours the next day but there was then a further inexplicable delay. Antibiotics were administered at 01:20 hours, Jason became unresponsive at 05:00 and died shortly thereafter.

The court found that these were basic errors and that the delay in the administration of antibiotics likely hastened Jason’s death and more than minimally contributed to Jason’s cause of death.","The hospital accepted that there were failings that contributed to Jason’s death. Measures to address those failings had not been fully implemented at the date of the inquest. There were no applicable standard operating procedures for worsening patients in the renal unit at the date of Jason’s death and none had been implemented by the date of inquest. Jason died on 23 March 2024. The inquest was held on 5 June 2025.

The court was told that the standard operating procedures are still being drafted in relation to identifying the appropriate pathway for the admission of worsening patients in the renal unit. The clinicians were undecided on applicable processes including whether the emergency department should be the default pathway.

The court found on the evidence that moving worsening patients out of the renal unit and onto in-patient facilities is imperative and should be done at the first available opportunity. Such action would reduce the risks of medication and treatment errors and delays such as that which occurred in Jason’s case. Delays due to uncertainties about appropriate pathways raises risks to patients who require the specialist treatment available on in-patient facilities.

I note similar concerns have been raised in a previous Regulation 28 Preventing Future Deaths report issued following the death Mr M.R. Jervis, [PFD dated 30.12.2024]. This earlier R28 report noted failings by AMU and other nursing staff to administer antibiotics when clinical observations repeatedly indicated such was required. The Jervis R28 report raised a concern regarding the absence of a digital alert on hospital software, which could have alerted staff to the need to implement sepsis six, including the need to administer antibiotics. It is unclear whether this measure has been introduced and if not, whether a digital alert would have made a difference in Jason’s case."

Murray,Greater Manchester South,The Secretary of State for Health; NHS England; Stepping Hill Hospital,"On 1 March 2024 an investigation was opened into the death of Neil John Clarke aged 81 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 May 2025. Sitting without a jury I made a determination that Neil John Clarke died as a result of hypoxic encephalopathy, aspiration pneumonia and infarcted bowel arising as a consequence of aspiration secondary to vomiting which precipitated a cardiac arrest following a right hemicolectomy.","Neil Clarke was a fit 81 year old who was investigated by way of colonoscopy following reports of bowel discomfort. A colonoscopy and polypectomy were carried out on 12 December 2022. Two polyps were removed and were benign. A repeat colonoscopy on 29 August 2023 showed recurrence of a polyp in the caecum. Endoscopic mucosal resection polypectomy failed. A discussion in MDT took place and the consensus was to proceed with a right hemicolectomy. The options provided to Mr Clarke were conservative management, further polypectomy or a right hemicolectomy. The latter was advised as the most appropriate option by clinicians as it would involve one invasive procedure rather than two and provide clarity as to the nature of the polyps being cancerous or benign. The surgery carried out on 12 February 2024 at Stepping Hill Hospital was uneventful save for some post operative bleeding. Once stabilised he was transferred to ward D5 on 15 February 2024. He felt unwell that afternoon and vomited. His ward lights were turned out at 23:00 and he was made comfortable. At 02:00 on 16 February he was agitated and then violently vomited before suffering a cardiac arrest. CPR was administered and he was taken to the intensive care unit where he was treated and monitored. Sadly, he had suffered a hypoxic encephalopathy following aspiration secondary to vomiting. He went on to develop aspiration pneumonia and an infarcted bowel which in conjunction with his hypoxic encephalopathy resulted in his death at Stepping Hill Hospital on 26 February 2024.","The considerations given to the appropriateness, from a safety and well-being perspective, of surgical procedures involving elderly patients who may benefit from more conservative measures and the associated documentation and guidance advising patients of different treatment choices.

My second concern arising from this interest was the accuracy of handover communications between clinical staff in respect of patients returning to the main ward from HDU."

Hartley,Nottinghamshire,Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire Police,"On 10 July 2023 an inquest was opened into the death of Barry Christopher Spooner, aged 74. The inquest concluded on 17 June 2025. I made a determination at inquest that he died as a result of unlawful killing.","Mr Spooner was exploited financially by the female until his death, and she made efforts to access his bank account, most probably after he had died. He was found in his home address having been murdered by the female.","1. Insufficient information sharing from Nottinghamshire Police to the Local Authority in the event of a public protection concern.

I heard evidence about the new Vulnerability Policy followed by the police in order to try to improve information sharing between organisations. I was told that when a PPN is completed and sent to the MASH it is considered by an experienced officer who decides whether or not to refer it on to Adult Social Care for their consideration. If they decide not to refer onwards then the officer will consider all PPNs from the previous 12 months. If this review causes them to change their opinion then the current PPN and the previous PPNs will be referred onwards. This ensures Adult Social Care has all relevant information to help them decide upon the best course of action.

In accordance with the Vulnerability Policy, it was explained to me that when a PPN is considered suitable for referral to Adult Social Care straight away then previous PPNs are not reviewed and sent on to Adult Social Care if they have not already had them. This means that in a scenario where there have been previous PPNs that have not been provided to Adult Social Care, then that team will not be aware of all of the relevant information when considering the referral from the MASH and the most appropriate course of action.

This may impact upon Adult Social Care’s ability to make a proper decision in such cases and may put vulnerable people at more of a risk depending upon whether previous PPNs have been provided to Adult Social Care, or not."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26/06/2025 11:15. The conclusion of the inquest was that died at 23:03 on 8 April 2025 on the carriageway of Station Approach, [REDACTED] having taken deliberate steps to end her own life [REDACTED]","Died at 23:03 on 8 April 2025 on the carriageway of Station Approach, [REDACTED] having taken deliberate steps to end her own life [REDACTED]","I read and heard evidence from the investigating CID officer who had reviewed all available CCTV in relation to the incident. She reported that Jody had arrived on the southbound platform just over an hour before she jumped. She sat on a bench for a few minutes before making her way onto [REDACTED]. She was on the [REDACTED] for about one hour before she actually did so. A total of 11 trains passed her, north and southbound, during that hour. No report was made or received of her presence there by train crews or station staff attending on the station platforms for arrivals and departures.

My concerns are:

1. Access to the [REDACTED] from the platform is not sufficiently barred or impeded to the public. It is clear by means of signage that the public must not go beyond the end of the platform. There are what appear to be some sort of wheeled access stoppers on the platform at and around the fence at its end. But there is nothing to prevent even a moderately mobile person from going around the fence and [REDACTED]. The main resource preventing access is human by means of station staff intervention, which is necessarily reliant on their presence at the relevant time;
2. [REDACTED] are not ones designed to prevent, impede or discourage attempts at suicide [REDACTED]
3. Eleven trains passed Jody, from north and south, while she was on [REDACTED] during the hour before she jumped. No reports were made by any train crew of her presence. It would be exceeding the available evidence and unfair to infer that train crews and/or station staff deliberately or negligently ignored her presence there. More likely is that she was simply not visible. It was dark, being at night in April, and Jody was wearing relatively dark clothing. However, she seems to have been discernible on CCTV and from the British Transport Police images I have seen taken from approximately where a driver might have been placed, it is plausible to suggest that she might have been visible, even laterally, from the cab of a train either slowing to stop at the station or pulling out from it, with even moderately enhanced lighting on the viaduct. Obviously, had a report been made of her presence, some type of intervention could have been attempted"

Nieto,Derby and Derbyshire,Chief Executive NHS Derby and Derbyshire Integrated Care Board; Chief Executive National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,"On 17 September 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Aaron ATKINSON aged 36. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was: -

Unascertained","Aaron was found deceased on the morning of 20 April 2023 at his home address. His death was completely unexpected.

As his cause of death was not known a postmortem examination was conducted including toxicology. The pathologist's opinion was that Aaron had died due to a seizure and positional asphyxia.

Aaron's mother was doubtful of the cause of death proposed and pressed for a second postmortem which was undertaken by a different pathologist. That pathologist considered that a more likely cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia caused by Aaron's prescription of Risperidone (for behavioural regulation), and Ritalin (for ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).

On the court's assessment of the evidence, applying the balance of probabilities, a probable medical cause of death cannot be determined.","Whilst Aaron had annual GP reviews related to prescription of anti-psychotic medication (Risperidone, although the inquest heard that prescription of Ritalin was also a relevant factor, particularly in combination with Risperidone), to check for signs of adverse side effects and physical health complications, those reviews did not include ECGs (electrocardiograms) to check for signs of adverse effects on electrical activity of the heart. On the medical evidence before the inquest antipsychotic medication carries recognised risk of QT interval prolongation and lethal cardiac arrhythmias.

It does not appear that the recognised risk of QT interval prolongation and lethal cardiac arrhythmias from long term prescription of antipsychotic medication is reflected in guidance to medical practitioners and prescribers, nationally or locally in terms of performing ECGs.

The relevant NICE (National Institute for Clinical Excellence) guidance (web link below) refers to ECG testing under How should I monitor someone taking antipsychotics? and recommends Electrocardiography (ECG) - after dose changes. Ideally, also annually.

The local Derbyshire Integrated Care Board guidance (web link below) does not identify need for ECG to be included in annual monitoring in primary care unless if new medicines or changes to physical health have increased the risk of prolonged QTc arrange ECG.

It appears there is lack of clarity and consistency for annual reviews to include ECGs where people are prescribed antipsychotic medication long term. Given the recognised risks explained at inquest then not providing annual ECGs for long term users of those medications appears to pose risk of death.

Shaw,Cumbria,"Chief Executive SSP Health Ltd.; Chief Executive Cumbria Health Ltd.; Chief Executive, Northwest Ambulance Service NHS Trust; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care","On 26 November 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Raymond Mallinson who died in Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle on 23 November 2024 aged 79. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest opened on 11 March 2025 and heard on 19 June 2025.","Thomas Malllinson who had a history including Type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease became unwell on 17 November with acute vomiting and diarrhoea.

The following day Monday 18 (second day of illness) his wife rang Carlisle Central Practice to request a GP appointment; she was told that no appointments were available and advised to ring NHS 111 for advice after 6pm that evening (not before because her call would be referred back to the practice where there were no appointments!). Thomas remained unwell so his wife called 111 and after an assessment and callback an hour later an ambulance was sent. The emergency medical technician assessed Thomas fully, all his observations were normal and so he was left with advice to try the GP practice again the following day if symptoms persisted

On Tuesday 19 (third day of illness) Thomas was no better, his wife did receive a telephone appointment from the GP practice and was issued a prescription for an anti-diarrhoeal medication.

On Wednesday 20 (fourth day of illness) Thomas was getting weaker and had soiled due to the diarrhoea. 111 was called again at 5.30pm and she was told that she had secured the last GP telephone appointment of the day at 6.30: that call never came. Getting desperate his wife rang 999 just before midnight, help was not sent but she was told a doctor from Cumbria Health (the out of hours provider) would call back within 2 hours: despite waiting up until 4am that call never came either.

On Thursday 21 (fifth day of illness). ""After another terrible night of continuous vomiting and diarrhoea"" the GP surgery was again called and an afternoon telephone appointment offered. ""Utterly exasperated stressed and traumatised"" his wife again tried 999 and this time an ambulance was sent. Thomas collapsed shortly after the crew arrived, they recognised how ill he was and took him to hospital immediately. On arrival in A&E Thomas was found to be hypotensive and hypothermic with acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis. Despite escalation to intensive care he developed refractory cardiogenic shock and died on 23 November.","(1) To SSP Health, owners and operators of Carlisle Central Practice, 65 Warwick Road, Carlisle.

I wish to thank [REDACTED] for his attendance and assistance at the hearing. It was acknowledged that on 18th the advice ""to call back tomorrow"" should never have been given and that the telephone appointment the following day really ought to have been a face to face assessment either in surgery or at Thomas's home. I am concerned that no body or organisation has taken responsibility for Thomas, an elderly man with significant co-morbidities, during his illness. Should this responsibility ultimately rest with a patient's general practitioner, if not where does it rest?

(2) To Cumbria Health (CH).

Thomas's case was sent electronically to the service, marked for 2 hour attention. I appreciate why this did not take place as it was impossible for clinicians on night duty to triage a large number of calls waiting while actually visiting and treating their caseload. I note a new ""OPEL"" system has since been instituted to try to escalate and get extra help as the number of calls waiting increases, but where will these extra resources come from overnight? I am also concerned that the referral from NWAS came as a result of a 999 emergency phone call but there seemed to be no way of telling NWAS that the call had not been dealt with and (presumably) passing responsibility back to them. As referred to above - where does responsibility lie?

(3) To Northwest Ambulance Service (NWAS) as providers of both 111 and 999 responses in Cumbria.

There were multiple calls to 111 and 999 in this case. I was told that there was no alert to a call handler to indicate recent contacts for the same patient with the same condition which might highlight a need for more decisive action. I am also concerned that (as above) there is no system that alerts your control to the fact that a 999 (emergency) case you have passed to another agency has not in fact been dealt with. A further concern refers specifically to the 111 service. At inquest it was questioned whether for out of hours GP services Cumbria had been better served when calls went to a local control room in Carlisle.

(4) To [REDACTED], Secretary of State for Health.

In my summing up after hearing the evidence in this case I explained the legal concept of neglect as a failure to provide basic care and (in this case) medical attention for someone in a dependent condition who cannot provide it for himself, and I remarked that I felt Thomas ""had fallen through an overcomplex system and was indeed neglected"". I am aware that you are hoping to develop a 10 year plan for the NHS and therefore feel it my duty to highlight this case to you as an example of how overcomplexity has lost sight of a man's urgent care needs."

The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Road traffic collision

Road traffic collision","Leigh Nardelli died on the A5 Southbound in Milton Keynes on 6 July 2024. He was driving a Mercedes AMG car at speed in torrential rain. There was extensive water pooling on the A5. There was dashcam footage of the vehicle aquaplaning and losing control. The offside of the vehicle hit the central reservation and travelled along it for a distance before hitting a ramped terminal of a further section of restraint barrier. This had been in place to protect the concrete support pillar of an overhead bridge. However, it is acutely ramped and allowed Mr Nardelli's vehicle to be projected up it, travel along the top before entering a wider space between the barriers on the south and northside. The vehicle then seems to have descended and ""flipped"" becoming airborne and striking the concrete support causing fatal injuries. The barrier ramp, known as a ""P1 terminal"" had been due for replacement to a safer bifurcated system in 2022 but for financial reasons was not.",The hazard posed by the design of the P1 terminal was known by National Highways and it was due for replacement at the site of the collision in 2022. It presented and continues to present a significant risk and was not replaced for financial reasons. There is a gradual roll out programme across National Highways to replace P1 terminals with a safer bifurcated system but I consider the implications of the financial limitations represents an ongoing safety concern for vehicles approaching them on designated roads.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 June 2025.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Jordanne “died from an undiagnosed pulmonary embolism. Her death was contributed to by neglect”.","On 10.8.24 Jordanne Roberts was assessed in the Emergency Department of the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch after falling down stairs at her home in Kidderminster. The locum doctor who assessed her discharged her home without waiting to read a full CT scan report, which identified that she had a pulmonary embolism. On the morning of 12.8.24 Jordanne collapsed suddenly at home, and died a short time later. A post mortem examination confirmed the cause of death to be a pulmonary embolism. Her death would probably have been prevented if the pulmonary embolism had been identified and treated in hospital.","1) Jordanne’s death arose because a locum doctor, said to be the most senior doctor on duty in the Emergency Department on 10.8.24, did not know that her CT scan taken that day would be reported in two parts. The initial report did not mention the presence of a pulmonary embolism, but did make clear that a second and final report was to follow. The doctor proceeded to make the decision to discharge Jordanne without reading the second and final report, which highlighted the pulmonary embolism;

2) In her evidence at inquest, [REDACTED] (Head of Patient Safety at the Trust) confirmed:
(a) that all of the Trust’s own employed doctors receive training so that they ensure that both parts of any CT scan report are read;
(b) that all new locum doctors working for the Trust are provided with an induction pack, which highlights the requirement to read both parts of any CT scan report.

However, [REDACTED] was unable to confirm that steps have been taken to ensure that all locum doctors already working at the Trust have received the equivalent training. She indicated that they have been invited to attend education sessions in which this topic has been covered, but that no record is kept of whether those doctors did in fact attend.

I am therefore concerned that unless and until the Trust is able to ensure that all locum doctors working at its hospitals have received training about the need to read both parts of a CT scan report, there remains a risk that (as in this case) life-threatening conditions may go undiagnosed, and consequently that patients’ lives may be put at risk."

The machinery used was a petrol-driven brush cutter with a metal blade.

In the course of strimming, Mr Kerslake cut through an 11kV electricity cable which was attached in the usual way to one of the vertical wooden poles of the pylon. The blade of the machine cut through the cable guard and the cable itself, causing the electrical explosion in which Mr Kerslake was injured.

The jury found that the medical cause of death was:

1a Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome
1b 52% Total Body Surface Area Burns
1c Electrical Explosion","1. There was no risk assessment in place warning workers on the estate of the risks of using machinery in the vicinity of electrical equipment.

It is not known if she had taken any of this.","No clinical handover to receiving ward. No instructions passed on from the doctor regarding cardiac monitoring. Patient's own medication found in her belongings which had been with her after her death, allowing her the opportunity to take another overdose."

Osborne,Milton Keynes,CEO Milton Keynes University Hospital,"On 21 January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karl Fraser Dunstan aged 56. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 June 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Narrative conclusion
The deceased died at Milton Keynes University Hospital on 14 January 2025 from a pulmonary embolism arising from a deep vein thrombosis. The opportunity to investigate and treat the pulmonary embolism was missed when the request for a CT pulmonary angiogram was declined without D-dimer testing and, when his clinical condition declined, was not met with emergency treatment for a pulmonary embolism. The missed opportunities more than minimally contributed to his death.","Karl Dunstan died at Milton Keynes University Hospital on 14 January 2025 from a pulmonary thromboembolism arising from a deep vein thrombosis. He had been admitted to the hospital the previous day with symptoms suggestive of a chest infection, but also with clinical features indicative of a pulmonary embolism, including shortage of breath, episodes of collapse and hypoxia. A request for a CT pulmonary angiogram was denied by the radiologist as it did not meet their criteria. There was a failure to perform a D-dimer test that if positive would have led to a CTPA that would have confirmed the pulmonary embolism. This would have resulted in thrombolysis being started when he collapsed.","That the investigation of a pulmonary embolism was not carried out in accordance with NICE guidance, and a request for a CT pulmonary angiogram by the consultant was rejected by the radiology department because it did not meet the threshold of the Wells score used by the hospital and yet a D-dimer test was not completed, that if positive, would have resulted in a CTPA. The policy and procedure is in need of an urgent review."

Potter,London Inner North,Chief Executive; North London NHS Foundation Trust,"On 20 September 2024, an investigation was commenced into the death of Louise Elizabeth Amy Crane, aged 39 years at the time of her death. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest heard by me between 2 June and 10 June 2025.

The inquest concluded with a short-form conclusion of suicide. The medical cause of death was:

1a ligature compression to the neck","Louise Crane had an established diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD). She also had diagnoses of depression and psychosis (in the context of drug use). Ms Crane first came into contact with mental health services in 2012, since then she had been treated in the community, in voluntary in-patient settings, and while detained under the Mental Health Act.

Ms Crane was admitted to hospital for emergency treatment in relation to her physical health on 2 May 2024, following an attempt to end her life. Once medically fit for discharge, Ms Crane was admitted to an in-patient psychiatric ward at Highgate Mental Health Centre (North London NHS Foundation Trust), under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. This detention commenced on 4 June 2024.

Following Ms Crane’s initial admission to Highgate Mental Health Centre, she was transferred to a psychiatric intensive care unit (Ruby Ward) on 5 July 2024. Ms Crane remained on Ruby Ward until she was stepped down to an acute mental health ward (Topaz Ward) on 5 September 2024.

On 19 September 2024, when Ms Crane remained detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act, she was found in her room suspended by a dressing gown cord used as a ligature.

The jury’s findings as to how, when, where and in what circumstances Ms Crane came by her death were, as follows:

“Louise Crane died in Highgate Mental Health Centre on 19 September 2024 from a ligature compression to the neck. Factors contributing to Louise’s death were a chronic high risk of suicide linked to Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, in combination with unsatisfactory information sharing and recording, and inadequate risk management, staffing and levels of care and treatment during Louise’s time on Topaz Ward.”","1) Record keeping / professional standards
There was evidence that staff on Topaz Ward would sometimes use the ID card of another member of staff to make notes on the records system, without making it clear who the entry was actually made by. In this case there were two entries that appeared to have been made by a support worker, that were actually made by a nurse. Such misleading and inaccurate record keeping risks significant confusion in the provision of care and potentially creates significant risk in relation to the continuity of care.

2) Lack of professional curiosity / therapeutic engagement – audits
This was a matter picked up during the Trust’s own investigation. The Trust’s action plan includes audits to monitor compliance with certain aspects of Trust policy etc. However, the Topaz Ward manager gave evidence that there had been issues with audits in the past, which had been escalated (prior to Ms Crane’s death) but no response received. I was not reassured that further audits would be sufficient to address the concerns already identified.

In addition to the above, numerous members of staff from Topaz Ward gave evidence during the inquest and it appeared that many of them struggled with the concept of ‘therapeutic engagement’. Some maintained that Ms Crane had received a sufficient level of therapeutic engagement from Ward staff, contrary to the findings of the Trust’s own investigation and the subsequent findings of the jury. This suggests a potentially widespread lack of understanding, and underlying knowledge of ‘therapeutic engagement’ and its importance in mental health care.

3) Step down / discharge from PICU to acute ward
There was evidence that the Trust’s systems were unable to accommodate the needs of Ms Crane in ensuring that her transition from an intensive care to an acute setting was as safe as possible for her. Numerous risks and needs were identified for the step down / discharge process, but most of these (which significantly impacted Ms Crane’s risk to self) were not facilitated.

4) Therapeutic engagement / professional curiosity – generally
The jury heard evidence from numerous members of Topaz Ward staff who were taken through the care records, that Ms Crane had become withdrawn from around 12 September 2024 onwards. Many of the witnesses denied this, despite the evidence to the contrary. The fact of Ms Crane becoming withdrawn had been identified by staff in PICU as a significant risk factor for Ms Crane. While this may not have been picked up by all staff due to record keeping issues (already identified by the Trust), the concern here is that there appears to have been a general inability among staff to recognise when a patient is becoming withdrawn, which raises concern about underlying professional curiosity.

5) Observations on Topaz Ward
The Trust’s own internal investigation highlighted issues regarding the review of required observation levels. However, the evidence at inquest, in relation to the observation round at or about 11:30 on 19 September raised a further concern, albeit this did not cause / contribute to Ms Crane’s death in the particular circumstances.

The evidence was that the support worker conducting this check did not see any part of Ms Crane, and on trying to open the door noted there was some resistance. As such, the assumption was made that Ms Crane was sat with her back to the door, and the support worker marked Ms Crane as being in her room and moved on to the next room. This raises the concern that observations being undertaken do not always comply with the Trust’s own observation policy and that there may be a staff training / knowledge gap in this regard.

6) Communication and culture
While the Trust’s internal investigation highlighted issues with documentation and record keeping, which is a key tool for communication, the evidence revealed a lack of general communication between staff at all levels. Aside from documentation matters, a lack of good communication more generally raises significant patient care risks and could undermine patient safety.

The substantive consultant psychiatrist for Topaz Ward said that they would change nothing about the care that was provided. This raises concerns that the senior clinician for the Ward does not accept or appreciate the issues identified by the Trust.

7) Trust action plan
Some of the matters contained within the Trust’s action plan, which stems from its own internal investigation, remain outstanding and / or are still awaiting Board level approval. As such, there is, to some extent, a lack of reassurance (at present) regarding the actions that will actually be taken to address the risks the Trust itself has already identified."

David Lee Walsh was travelling in a Mercedes GLC300 motor vehicle on 6 January 2024 when it left the road at Whitegates Farm, Tetney Lock Road, Tetney and entered the Louth Canal.

The Police complete a Stat 19 Form which is then sent to the Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership. The information from the Stat 19 Form is then collated and placed onto the WINGS software programme which is a Council owned software programme. This information is reviewed on an annual basis where the types of incidents are considered along with the traffic flow on that road and it gives a score. Based on the score there is then a ranking of sites where there has been more than one collision within a set area (known as a Cluster). The score is used to decide where the Highways Department should intervene first on looking at potential safety improvements. The Accident Investigation Team and the Road Safety Partnership then look at each of those Cluster Sites and investigate those sites. Consideration will then be given to what improvements could be made to the highway to reduce the risk of future incidents. As these reports are only considered annually there is the possibility that other incidents can occur prior to the annual review that could have been prevented had a report been made to the Highways Department at the time of the incident."

Hetherington,Northumberland,Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust; 49 Marine Avenue Surgery; Moorbridge School; North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care Board; Department of Health,I commenced an investigation into the death of REDACTED Deceased. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 June 2025.,"The deceased was aged 17 years of age. She had a diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder and suffered with anxiety. She complained of symptoms of brain fog, syncope, blurred vision and chronic fatigue which she attributed to COVID 19 or a physical cause.

She experienced significant weight loss.

She underwent a number of investigations including for an autonomic dysfunction (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome) and no formal diagnosis was made. The investigations raised the suspicion of vasovagal response and deconditioning. She admitted to restricting her diet to manage her symptoms.

The deceased was seen in the syncope clinic on 20 November 2023. Her weight was recorded as 42.9 kg with a BMI of 16.6. The Consultant Physician was concerned that the deceased was underweight and further investigation of her weight loss was appropriate. On 20 November 2023 referrals were sent to the General Practitioners, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and Dietetics to monitor her weight. By the time of her admission to hospital on 30 April 2024 her weight was 26.6 kg. I heard this was 50% of what would be expected as her median weight. From 20 November 2023 her weight had decreased by 16.3 kg.

She was admitted to Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital from home on 30 April 2024 in an advanced state of starvation and with a very low Body Mass Index. The clinicians recognised the imminent risk to life. She agreed to nasogastric feeding and a nasogastric tube was placed on 2 May 2024. On 3 May 2024 she was placed under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act for assessment and treatment.

On 5 May 2024 before insertion of a central venous line into the jugular she was placed head down, felt nauseous and went on to vomit. She was rolled over onto her left side and oropharyngeal suction was applied. There was a rapid decline in her condition, she became bradycardic and cardiac output was lost. Despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation she died within the critical care unit at Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital at 10.25 hours on 5 May 2024.","1. The deceased’s weight was not adequately monitored from November 2023.

I am concerned there was no physical or face to face monitoring of the deceased’s weight from November 2023. I heard about the importance of physical eye to eye contact and examination on a face-to-face basis so that one can see evidence of the skin, properly see the patient’s face and when doing the height and weight asking for the removal of some of their clothing to assess muscle mass.

2. There was no referral to gastroenterology

I am concerned there is confusion as to the guidance on Consultant-to-Consultant referrals.

The Consultant Physician wrote to the GP saying, ""please monitor weight loss and refer into gastroenterology services for further assessment"".

The GP was aware of guidance regarding Consultant-to-Consultant referrals that had been updated in October 2023 so that Consultants could and should be directly referring patients themselves to another speciality if there was a clinical reason to do so, rather than passing that task back to the GP. The Consultant Physician told me the guidance was not cascaded down to trust level until December 2023 after the Consultant Physician saw the deceased and that the final guidance has not yet been received.

3. The deceased was discharged from CAMHS in December 2023 without being seen in person, spoken to or weighed

The second referral to CAMHS was following the Consultant Physician’s letter dated 20 November 2023. The request was “I would be grateful if you could see this young girl urgently for advice with regards to oral intake. She has lost weight over a number of months and clinical history as outlined above”. The deceased was offered an appointment in keeping with the 4-week national waiting timescale for CYP with an eating disorder.

Contact was made with mum on 24 November and an appointment offered for 13 December 2023. During the call mum told staff the deceased “hated CAMHS so might kick off and refuse to come”. Mum cancelled the appointment on 11 December 2023.

CAMHS contacted mum by telephone on 12 December 2023. Mum said that the deceased was not aware that she had been referred to CAMHS, was not willing to attend. Again, there was no exploration as to why that was the case and no direct contact with the deceased.

(a) I am concerned the deceased was discharged from CAMHS on 12 December 2023 without being seen face to face or spoken to directly.

(b) I am concerned there was no scrutiny as to why the deceased was reluctant to engage and not attend appointments.

4. There was no in person assessment by dietetics or escalation of care

The deceased was assessed via telephone on all occasions. I am concerned that whilst telephone assessments expedited contact there was no in person face to face assessment to record weight or to take and record clinical observations.

At assessment on 2 January 2024, the deceased was not aware of her current weight. A weight history from 20 November 2023 and a 2022 weight were noted. Her BMI was calculated as 17.

On 5 March 2024 the deceased was reviewed by a specialist dietitian again by telephone. The deceased self-reported her weight to be 33kg with a calculated BMI of 13.4.

The Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders (MEED) guidelines are used to identify at the earliest stage possible the appropriate care and treatment to be provided. It identifies BMI calculators in the green, amber and red.

Red or high risk would be a BMI less than 13.

The next specialist dietitian review took place on 26 April 2024, 2 weeks later than planned again by telephone. The self-reported weight was 31.8kg with a calculated BMI of 12.9

I am concerned that there was no escalation of care or onward referral, and I am concerned about staff’s understanding of the Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders (MEED) guidelines.

5. The passage of information/communication

Communication: I heard about the importance of the passage of information. During the course of the inquest a witness was taken to the SEN chronology and an entry dated 1 March 2024 which refers to a conversation with the deceased’s mother on 29 February 2024 where she described the deceased having significant problems with her eating habits, losing weight and refusing to eat foods that would be good for her and put weight on her.

I am concerned that this information was not shared to an appropriate body.

6. One records system - weights, heights and Body Mass Index (BMI)

I heard that patient care records are held on different care record systems within the NHS which are not universally accessible to healthcare organisations, healthcare professionals or patients. I heard good examples of accessible records such as the Great North Care Record (GNCR) and SystmOne operated by some in Primary Care.

I am concerned there is not one accessible system for weights, heights and BMI.

7. Oversight of care in an outpatient setting

There is a lack of clarity regarding oversight of care in an outpatient setting.

The Patient Safety Incident Investigation report identified that there was a lack of oversight of care. The early help assessment team were stepped down in 2022 and they may have been the appropriate team to maintain oversight of care. The SI report comments that the referrals between services were all appropriate but it was unclear who had oversight of all of the care and that the investigation team felt that oversight was unclear and that arrangements around risk assessment escalation safeguarding and GP involvement could have been better through improved communication.

I heard that in an inpatient setting there are key NHS standards set around what was described as “the name at the end of the bed” which healthcare professionals work within.

I am concerned that in an outpatient setting there is no specific guidance regarding oversight of care within the NHS. No one department or clinician has overall responsibility or accountability."

An investigation into his death was opened on 23/7/24. The inquest was concluded on 9/5/25.,"Mr Viles suffered from back pain, depression and insomnia. He was under the care of several doctors, including both NHS and private providers for these conditions.

He had suicidal ideation on several occasions and had previously overdosed on medication. He took a further intentional overdose of medication, including [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] at his home residence and died as a consequence of this act. I determined that he intended to end his life.","1. I heard evidence from several medical professionals regarding the risks that Mr Viles posed to himself and that this risk was recognised prior to his death.

You provided a statement, dated 5/1/25, for the inquest which set out the interventions that you and your colleagues had undertaken to treat Mr Viles’ back pain in 2023 and 2024. No reference was made to any prescriptions that you issued and therefore, given the medical cause of death that had been proposed, I did not summons you to attend the inquest.

You did note that you had referred Mr Viles to a psychologist, who consulted with him on 19/6/24 and raised concerns regarding the need for urgent psychiatric input, given his suicidal ideation. You also noted that you reviewed him after the psychologist’s input and concluded that he was not suitable for spinal cord stimulation.

At the inquest it could not be determined from where Mr Viles had obtained the medication on which he overdosed. I therefore wrote a letter of concern to you, asking if you had prescribed medication (as had been suggested by the mental health trust’s evidence).

You replied on 13/6/25, setting out that you had prescribed four weeks’ worth of [REDACTED] on 28/6/24 (nine days after the psychologist’s consultation).

I am concerned that you prescribed this medication after the psychologist you had referred Mr Viles to had raised significant concerns regarding his mental health."

Hassell,London Inner North,"Executive Medical Director, Whittington Health NHS Trust; President, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health; President, Royal College of Emergency Medicine; Chief Executive, Royal College of Nursing","On 19 July 2024, one of my assistant coroners, Richard Brittain, commenced an investigation into the death of Finlay Roberts aged 2 years and 11 months. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 June 2025.

I made a determination at inquest that Finlay died from a rare (in a child) but recognised natural cause, a sigmoid volvulus.","Finlay’s parents took him to the Whittington Hospital the night before he died, but the paediatric emergency department was understaffed and it was an extremely busy night.

There was a failure to conduct serial nursing observations; not all tests were carried out as appropriate; and, though specialist advice was sought from Great Ormond Street Hospital, the late arrival of x-rays, a lack of complete information and a failure to close the loop of communication meant that the advice was not obtained before Finlay was discharged home.

It is unclear whether different hospital care that night would have saved Finlay’s life. It would have given him a chance.","The lack of serial nursing observations was a fundamental omission from Finlay’s care. I heard at inquest that there have been many improvements in the paediatric emergency department at the Whittington since his death, not least of which has been the addition of more nursing staff.

However, a lack of paediatric nursing observations is a subject about which I wrote a PFD report on 13 March 2025 to a different hospital (the Royal Free) following the death of Billie Wicks.

I remain concerned on two counts:

1. A lack of nursing observations may be a much wider issue than is recognised. In my experience there is nothing about the Whittington and the Royal Free that stands out as unusual.

2. The medical staff at the Whittington did not recognise the lack of nursing observations.
• Observations were thought to be acceptable because they were not reported as otherwise, when in fact they were absent.
• The discharging doctor decided that, if his final observations were normal Finlay could go home. Those observations were never carried out, but Finlay was nevertheless discharged."

Reid,Worcestershire,Green Range Limited,"On 7 November 2024 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Vera Kathleen FORTEY. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 June 2025.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Mrs. Fortey “died from natural causes, to which an injury sustained in a recent accidental fall contributed”.","On 29 September 2024 Vera Fortey, who had recently suffered a fall in her room at the care home in Worcester where she lived, underwent a hemiarthroplasty procedure to repair a fractured hip sustained in that fall. Although making an uneventful recovery from the surgery, such that she was transferred to Wyre Forest Ward, Kidderminster Hospital for rehabilitation on 14 October 2024, she became increasingly frail. Despite treatment, she continued to decline and died in Kidderminster Hospital on 5 November 2024.","1) Mrs. Fortey suffered an unwitnessed fall in her room at The Willows Care Home, Worcester shortly after midnight on 25.9.24. The carers who came and assisted her felt that she had not injured herself, and did not seek any medical attention for her. In fact, no medical attention was sought until shortly before midday on 27.9.24, when she was recorded as not being able to support her own body weight. The disclosure provided by the care home for the inquest did not contain:
- any contemporaneous account of this fall written by either of the two carers who dealt with her at the time;
- any entry made in Mrs. Fortey’s Daily Notes of this fall.
Furthermore, although there was a document which the then manager of the care home had written, which was said to summarise the accounts of the fall given to her by the carers concerned, this document made no reference to the date of the fall;
I was forced to conclude that no contemporaneous account of the fall on 25.9.24 ever made its way on to Mrs. Fortey’s file.

2) The then care home manager was informed by telephone about the fall at the time, and later on the morning of 25.9.24 reviewed Mrs. Fortey’s care plans. At no time did she pick up on the fact that no account of the fall was contained on Mrs. Fortey’s file.

3) Before the fall in the early hours of 25.9.24 Mrs. Fortey was able to mobilise independently. After the fall, a number of entries were made in Mrs. Fortey’s Daily Notes, which referred to her:
- Being unable to support herself, having bad mobility and requiring a wheelchair (1626hrs 25.9.24);
- Having very bad mobility and requiring a wheelchair (1848hrs 26.9.24);
- Being very confused and agitated, with very bad mobility (0713hrs 27.9.24);
Despite these obvious changes in her condition, no member of staff identified that these changes might have been due to the fall on 25.9.24. Therefore in the 2½ days after the fall, several opportunities were missed to have Mrs. Fortey medically examined, and for her fractured hip to have been identified and treated sooner. A significant reason for these opportunities being missed was the fact that the original fall was not documented in Mrs. Fortey’s file.

4) Although she had only been in post since 13.8.24, then the care home manager told the inquest that a reason why she may not herself have picked up on the above failings was because at the time of these events, she was still not familiar with the care home’s records system, was unable to scroll through residents’ notes, and was instead just “muddling through”.

It therefore appears that insufficiently robust measures are in place at The Willows Care Home to ensure:
(a) that staff understand the need to record significant incidents in residents’ records;
(b) that a regular auditing procedure is in place to help ensure that residents’ records are being updated properly; and
(c) that all staff at the care home (including managers) have received training so as to be as familiar with the computerized records system in use there as their role may require."

Cummings,Milton Keynes,Milton Keynes University Hospital; Central North West London NHS Foundation Trust,"On 29 June 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Edward Joseph Cassin aged 66. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Narrative conclusion

Eddie Cassin was a delightful elderly male with learning difficulties who was prone to silent aspiration. Although cleared for discharge home he was developing an aspiration pneumonia on 24 June 2023 which went unrecognised. He had hypoglycaemic episodes which were not managed according to trust guidelines. He was fed jelly which was expressly contraindicated. Food and medication was left in his mouth, some of which he aspirated. This was not recognised and exacerbated the already developing aspiration pneumonia. Had he been treated for the developing aspiration pneumonia he would likely not have died at the time he did. His death was contributed to by neglect.","Edward Joseph Cassin was an elderly man with complex medical needs and learning difficulties. He had a known dysphagia which caused him silent aspiration. He had been investigated by the Speech and Language Therapist (SALT) team and his diet was prescribed by the Dietetic Service. He had frequent chest infections/pneumonia as a result. He was in the Milton Keynes University Hospital pending discharge to a new care home. On 24 June 2023 he was generally out of sorts, not eating his lunch which he normally did with enthusiasm likely due to another developing aspiration infection. His diabetes had been difficult to manage and there were several alterations to his insulin regime. On 24 June 2023 he had a hypoglycaemic episode requiring treatment. The hospital guidelines were not followed. Because of his dysphagia he was on a modified diet and required supervision when eating to mitigate aspiration risk. Jelly was specifically and repeatedly highlighted as a food he should not be given. Despite this there was evidence of repeated administration of jelly through his stay including on 24 June. This was a food that was specifically excluded by the Dietetic Service. Their advice was not followed. He was not properly supervised and he aspirated. The expert evidence which I accepted, was that had his developing aspiration infection been recognised and treated, he would have survived. It was made worse by the aspiration following his hypoglycaemic attack.","The Speech and Language Therapists (SALT) and Dietetic Service had well developed, comprehensive guidelines for investigating and managing patients prone to aspiration. Those guidelines were disseminated through the wards at Milton Keynes University Hospital and nursing and other staff were appraised of them or at least, should have been. I was disturbed to discover though that there was a lack of understanding of some of those policies and procedures some 22 months or so after the death. The SALT and Dietetic services are provided by the Central and North West London NHS Trust into the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. It appeared to me that both Trusts were working to a degree in a siloed manner and that closer co-operation and sharing of clinical responsibility would benefit patients in a similar position in the future."

Stewart,Suffolk,Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,"On 03 January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Charlotte Louise Alderson aged 34. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 02 May 2025 which I heard with a jury. The conclusion of the inquest jury was that:

Narrative conclusion - Mrs Alderson reported feeling unwell from 17 December 2022. She attended the GP surgery on 19 December 2022. Observations were taken which were considered to be within normal range. Centor score of 2 was generated which indicated no antibiotics were required at this time. An outer ear infection was diagnosed and a prescription was given for a topical antibiotic spray. Redness of the throat was observed and a throat swab was taken to be sent for analysis. It was recorded she was taking over-the-counter pain relief. It was advised she should return to the surgery if her symptoms worsened.

Mrs Alderson reported feeling better on 20 December 2022 but then felt worse that evening. She then suffered bouts of sickness and diarrhoea throughout the night.

On 21 December 2022 at 7am, Mrs Alderson reported this to her husband and went to bed. At 11am on the same day, her husband checked on her and upon observing a blue tinge to her lips, called 111. The 111 call handler triaged the symptoms using a computer-based system. Upon reporting a blue tinge to Mrs Alderson's lips in module 0, a category 2 ambulance response was triggered.

The 111 call handler manually called 999 as the system did not automatically dispatch an ambulance.

Mrs Alderson's condition worsened, and her husband made an additional call to 999. He was advised the ambulance was en route.

The ambulance arrived at 11:57am and a Senior Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) made a clinical assessment of Mrs Alderson, including multiple observations.

The Senior EMT did not observe blue-tinged lips. Observations were generally within normal range, other than a slightly elevated temperature and heart rate. At the scene, the Senior EMT called Mrs Alderson's GP surgery and discussed symptoms and observations with the duty doctor. This was standard practice at the time. With no requirement identified for immediate hospitalisation, the ambulance left at 13:15.

Mrs Alderson's condition worsened further and her husband left to purchase pain relief. Upon his return, he found Mrs Alderson in a state of collapse. She was unconscious but breathing.

He called 999 immediately (14:09). During this call, Mrs Alderson stopped breathing. Bystander CPR commenced and an ambulance was dispatched at 14:15.

En route to the scene, further backup was requested due to the report that Mrs Alderson had stopped breathing.

The ambulance arrived at 14:26 and the ambulance crew took control of resuscitation attempts. Leading Operations Manager Team arrived at 14:37, followed by the critical care team (HEMS) a minute later, who employed multiple methods of resuscitation.

Resuscitation attempts were ceased at 15:29 and Record of Life Extinct was completed at 15:54.

The post-mortem examination carried out on 30 December 2022 found that the cause of death was as a result of multi-organ failure due to septic shock, arising from the rapid progression of a bacterial infection into the bloodstream.

This infection was identified as beta haemolytic streptococcus infection, the presence of which was confirmed by the results of the swab previously taken for testing on 19 December 2022.

The toxicology report was unremarkable.

It is therefore concluded that Charlotte Louise Alderson died of natural causes.

The jury would like to express their sincere personal condolences to the family.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1a Multi organ failure
1b Septic shock
1c Beta haemolytic streptococcus infection",<NA>,"I have concerns in three areas which are as follows:

a. There are two scoring systems used by clinicians to assess infection in patients presenting to them, namely; CENTOR and FEVRAPAIN. Either may be used by clinicians. Both systems use similar parameters to diagnose and indicate treatment. However, in their application to a given set of circumstances they can produce different outcomes, specifically in relation to the prescription of antibiotics. It is possible in Mrs Alderson’s case that the use of the FEVRAPAIN scoring system (as opposed to CENTOR) may have made a difference by indicating a prescription for antibiotics, which if taken on the day she was assessed by her GP, may have resulted in a different outcome. There is a need to review these scoring systems, drawing upon the most effective elements of each, with a view to providing guidance on a single scoring system that can consistently be applied by clinicians.

b. Evidence received during the inquest indicated that a number of existing measures within the National Health Service are capable of modification to provide testing tools for the early identification of sepsis/risk of sepsis and which would better inform decisions to prescribe antibiotics. These include CRP, finger prick and lateral flow tests. The risks associated with sepsis and the speed with which a rapid deterioration can occur in patients without clear warning signs of sepsis being present, are well known. There is therefore a need for the expeditious development of measures which assist clinicians in the early identification and treatment of sepsis.

c. During the course of the evidence presented at this inquest, the court heard that the interoperability toolkit (ITK) used to handover information between 111 and 999 services will on occasions fail, requiring the manual backup of a telephone call. This was identified as a national issue which, although not frequent, when it occurs carries a significant risk of critical information not being passed due to human error. I am concerned that in such circumstances the manual backup is not adequate and there is a risk that significant information is not passed thereby increasing a risk to life."

Keighley,Cheshire,Minster Care Group; 1st Care 4U,"On 7 October 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Margaret Elizabeth Douglas aged 82. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 June 2025.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Margaret Elizabeth Douglas died as a consequence of naturally occurring disease, contributed to by injuries sustained as a result of recurrent falls. It has not been possible to determine whether, on the balance of probabilities, an acute event occurred in the period immediately prior to her death which contributed to it.","On the 1 June 2024, Margaret Elizabeth Douglas had an unwitnessed fall at home, having suffered a minor stroke and was noted to be experiencing increased confusion, slurred speech and difficulties mobilising. Following a period of rehabilitation in hospital, Elizabeth was admitted to the Heathside Assessment Pathway service to support her recovery and was assessed by the Speech and Language Therapy team as requiring level 2 fluids as she was at risk of aspiration.

Whilst at Heathside, Elizabeth suffered two falls, one of which caused a small bleed on her brain which was not identified on imaging at the time. Elizabeth was discharged home with a package of care but was unable to cope because of her risk of falls.

On the 22 August 2024, Elizabeth was moved to Holcroft Grange where her risk of falls was identified as high and she suffered a number of further falls, leading to a decline in her condition, an increase in the size of her subdural haemorrhage, worsening stroke symptoms with her becoming increasingly frail and at increased risk of aspiration. By the 5 September 2024, Holcroft Grange had identified that they were no longer able to meet Elizabeth’s needs, considering that she required one to one care, however, they accepted her back without one to one care, following which, she suffered a further fall, causing injury to her face. A condition of Elizabeth’s discharge was that one to one care would be provided, which Holcroft Grange outsourced to a care agency.

In the days which followed, Elizabeth’s condition deteriorated with a worsening of her stroke symptoms and a developing chest infection with a ceiling of care being put in place for her to remain at Holcroft Grange with input from primary care services.

On the 28 September 2024, it was noted that there had been a further deterioration in Elizabeth’s condition, as she was unable to hold her head up and had been unsettled and often screaming. Staff advised that she should be cared for in bed, but no medical advice was sought and consequently the deterioration in her condition was not assessed with no consideration of symptom management or whether she had reached a point whereby she required end of life care.

Overnight on the 29 September 2024, Elizabeth was unsettled and the carer who took over her care the following morning was unable to understand what had occurred overnight or communicate successfully to assess Elizabeth’s needs. That morning, Elizabeth was provided with a drink, although it has not been possible to say whether at the time, Elizabeth was positioned correctly to avoid her risk of aspiration. Soon afterwards, Elizabeth was laid down, stopped breathing and passed away.

Given the ambiguity of the evidence provided at inquest, it has not been possible to determine whether an acute event occurred at that time which contributed to Elizabeth’s death.","i) In the course of the inquest I heard evidence that by 5 September 2024, Holcroft Grange had already identified that they were unable to meet Elizabeth’s needs, considering that she required one to one care. Despite being aware that they were unable to meet Elizabeth’s needs and that they were unable to provide one to one care, Holcroft Grange accepted Elizabeth back into their care, following which she suffered a further fall. Agreeing to provide care for an individual in circumstances where it is known that the level of care that person requires to keep them safe cannot be provided, creates a risk that future deaths could occur as a consequence of inadequate care and supervision.

ii) In the course of the inquest I heard evidence from the individual who was caring for Elizabeth on the morning of her death and in the course of that evidence it became apparent that the carer had little understanding of Elizabeth’s needs and had difficulty communicating and understanding information in English. The evidence given by those at Holcroft Grange was that they outsourced the provision of the one to one carers to a company, '1st Care 4 U Ltd' who had been approved for use by their parent company 'Minster Care Group'. At the time the care was provided, it was known by those responsible for sourcing the care, that there were difficulties with Elizabeth’s communication and her complex needs. This evidence gives rise to significant concerns in respect of the ability of those providing one to one care to understand an individual’s complex needs and their ability to communicate with those who themselves have difficulties with their speech. The concerns were heightened in the context of this case given that Elizabeth was at high risk of aspiration and if carers are unable to understand the complexities of an individual’s needs and communicate effectively with them, it poses a risk to their life."

Stewart,Suffolk,"Managing Partner, Alexandra & Crestview Surgeries; Alexandra & Crestview Surgeries","On 9 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Terence COLBY aged 82.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 September 2024.

The conclusion of the inquest was:

Natural causes

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1a Peripheral Vascular Disease","Terence Colby was admitted to hospital with ulceration and purplish discolouration on the left fourth toe and swollen inflamed ipsilateral foot on 19 August 2023. Mr Colby had been complaining of swelling and throbbing pain to his left toe since June 2023 which had been treated as gout. He had been assessed by a GP on 17 August 2023.

Mr Colby's family took him to A&E on 18 August 2023 following which he was admitted on 19 August 2023. Following assessment, Mr Colby was diagnosed with critical limb ischaemia secondary to peripheral vascular disease with an acute on chronic occlusion of his left leg and foot. Attempts at re-perfusion were made with no success. He had a below knee amputation to his left lower limb on 29 August 2023 and was stable post-operation. However, he developed hospital acquired pneumonia on 6 September 2023 and then suffered from a pulmonary embolism the following day (7 September 2023). He continued to deteriorate until it became clear to treating clinicians that he was unlikely to improve.

Following discussions with his family, Mr Colby was transferred to a hospice for end-of-life care. He was admitted to a hospice on 26 September 2023 where he died on 27 September 2023.","During the course of the inquest evidence was received in the form of a report from an expert in general practice, commissioned by the court and which considered the care and treatment provided to Mr. Colby by his GP practice (Alexandra & Crestview Surgeries, Lowestoft). The report highlighted substantially sub-standard practice provided to Mr. Colby on 17 August 2023 by Alexandra & Crestview Surgeries. This was as follows:

On 17 August 2023, despite the presence of a wound on the foot and the report of leg pain, there was a failure by the examining GP to undertake a simple vascular examination of Mr. Colby’s limb.

The expert report highlighted that this was despite the fact that “As per the NICE guidance already quoted, peripheral arterial disease needed to be considered here and this was a patient who had attended face to face. In my view this was substantially sub-standard practice and a failure to provide basic medical care (failure to examine) and was against national guidelines.”

Although the inquest did not conclude that the failure identified above was causative of Mr. Colby’s death, I am concerned that should such practice continue, without remedial action, then there is a risk of future death in other patients."

Morris,Greater Manchester South,"The Chief Executive, Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust","On 28 February 2025, I opened an inquest into the death of Valerie Hampson who died at Willow Wood Hospice, Ashton-under-Lyne on 29 December 2024, aged 82 years. The investigation concluded with an inquest which I heard on 11 June 2025.

A post mortem examination determined Mrs Hampson died as a consequence of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.

At the end of the inquest, I recorded a conclusion of natural causes.","Mrs Hampson died at Willow Wood Hospice, Ashton-under-Lyne on 29 December 2024 as a consequence of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, having first been diagnosed with a low grade follicular lymphoma in 2023.","The court heard evidence that in 10/2024, Mrs Hampson sustained minor wounds to both knees in a fall outside her home. Mrs Hampson was later seen on a number of occasions in the Emergency Department and referred herself to the District Nurses on 4/10/2024 for wound care, remaining on their case load until her admission to Tameside General Hospital on 30/10/2024.

By the time Mrs Hampson’s wounds were formally assessed in hospital by a Tissue Viability Nurse on 31/10/2024, the wound to her left knee was described as ‘5.4cm x 13cm 10% necrosis (thick dark devitalised tissue) 40% slough (yellow devitalised tissue) 50% granulation tissue.’

I am concerned that the Trust has not undertaken any serious incident investigation with a view to identifying if any learning could usefully be identified in the light of the progression of Mrs Hampson’s left leg wound whilst under the care of the District Nurses.

It is a further matter of concern that the court heard evidence that an orthopaedic review undertaken in the Emergency Department on Mrs Hampson’s initial attendance resulted in a recommendation that Mrs Hampson should be followed up in fracture clinic. For reasons which did not become clear during the inquest, the evidence of the consultant orthopaedic surgeon was that no such follow up appears to have taken place."

Wood,Kent North East,"Chief Executive, East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust","On 6 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Upali Meththananda. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was Narrative ""He died as a result of bleeding from a severed blood vessel, a rare but recognised complication of thoracentesis. The haemorrhage occurred following the insertion of a chest drain to drain fluid from a left sided pleural effusion which arose as a complication of coronary artery bypass surgery for his underlying ischaemic heart disease.""","Upali Meththananda was a 76 year old physiotherapist who despite his age was still working and active. He had a medical history of hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and previous stroke when he began to suffer from chest pain in early 2023. Coronary angiography revealed severe triple vessel disease and he was referred for coronary artery bypass surgery at St. Bartholomew's hospital. He underwent surgery at St. Bartholomew's on 3 October 2023 and his aorta was found to be heavily calcified so a decision was made to conduct the procedure without cardiopulmonary bypass. The procedure itself was complicated by bleeding and he required a number of blood products during surgery. He recovered following surgery but had a residual pleural effusion following removal of his chest drains but he was fit for discharge home when he left hospital on 10 October 2023.

He presented by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath on 17 October 2023 and was admitted to the Coronary Care unit. Imaging revealed a large left sided pleural effusion which was creating a midline shift and following discussions with his earlier treating cardiologist, treating cardiothoracic surgeon and the cardiologist at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital a decision was made to perform a chest drain locally.

The chest drain was inserted on the afternoon of 20 October 2023 at around 14.30-15.00 and 700mls of blood stained fluid drained before the drain was removed. He was initially stable but following the insertion he collapsed with signs of hypovolaemia at 15.45. An emergency call was initiated and help summoned and attempts were made to correct his hypovolaemia using blood products and drugs and discussions held with the team at St. Bartholomew's about transferring him. He remained unstable and at around 18.15 suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest and despite continued attempts at resuscitation including a thoracotomy to stem any bleeding he died at 19.40.","(1) I was concerned about the documentation as the inquest process had been hampered by the poor documentation and whilst I accepted that clinicians may have been providing care and not always documenting the care provided during this time the importance of documentation cannot be understated. However it was not just in the emergency setting where the clinical notes were lacking the clinical notes did not record key events and observations taken even in the period prior to his collapse. Clinical observations were not documented, meaning that trends were not available to treating clinicians and they would not have a full picture upon which to base any clinical decisions. Discussions between clinicians at other organisations were also not documented and forms used by the hospital for procedures were not used as required even by experienced clinicians. Whilst I heard some improvements had been made by the witness who presented the Trust's action plan I remained concerned that the failure to document procedures and observations as well as advice given from third parties could lead to clinicians who take over care for a patient not having a full picture and leading to risks to patients in the future."

Clarke,Kent North East,East Kent University Hospitals Foundation Trust,"An inquest into the death of Mrs Ann Caldicott, aged 66, was opened on 8 July 2024 and concluded on 7 April 2025.
The medical cause of death was:
- 1a. Septic shock
- 1b. Generalised peritonitis
- 1c. Iatrogenic bladder perforation
- II. Congestive heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, generalised atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic kidney disease

The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows:

“Mrs Ann Caldicott was admitted to hospital on 17 January 2024 having been unwell for some time with lack of appetite, weight loss and dehydration amongst other symptoms. She had become increasingly frail despite numerous interactions with both primary and secondary care.

On her final admission Mrs Caldicott underwent investigations including a kidney biopsy complicated by bleeding and she was found to have a perforated bladder caused by the insertion of a urinary catheter. Mrs Caldicott was considered too physiologically frail to undergo the treatment required to fix the perforated bladder and Mrs Caldicott died in hospital on 21 February 202.”","Mrs Caldicott had a long-standing history of weight loss, anaemia, and deterioration in renal function. Despite multiple attendances and admissions to both primary and secondary care, no adequate nutritional assessment, referral to specialist services, or frailty intervention occurred. These failures contributed to a profound physiological decline. On her final admission, a urinary catheter insertion resulted in a bladder perforation. Due to her poor physiological reserve, she was deemed unfit for the necessary surgical intervention and died in hospital on 21 February 2024.","1. Ann’s malnutrition and declining frailty were not investigated despite continued requests by Ann and her family to primary and secondary care settings.
2. Ann’s marked anaemia and poor nutritional state meant that she was not suitable for potentially lifesaving treatment when it became necessary.
3. No internal investigations were conducted by Ann’s GP or by the East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to establish if lessons could be learned as a result of the circumstances of Ann’s death.
4. The court was informed that there had been an SJR (of which I had not previously been notified) following Ann’s death. The doctor providing evidence was to raise a Datix in relation to Ann’s previous attendances and failed discharges. At the resumed inquest the court were informed these investigations had not taken place and were not to take place.
5. No consideration was given prior to Ann’s final admission and some 18 months after the onset of symptoms of vomiting and chronic weight loss, of support for Ann’s nutritional status.
6. If Ann had been in a better nutritional state on her final admission to the Kent and Canterbury, then she would have been well enough to undergo lifesaving treatment following the bladder perforation."

- a review of the effectiveness of Halon fire extinguishers to deal with onboard fires.

- a review of regulations (if required) to prevent the use of cigarettes in the cockpit and related flammable items and materials.

Drug related death

1a MDMA toxicity

II","Emily Stokes was 17 years old and a looked after child, having been in foster care since 2012.

Since 17 May 2024 she had been living in a semi independent placement in Chingford following the breakdown in her foster care placement in Kent. She had made plans to meet friends at the Worried about Henry music festival at Dreamlands in Margate, Kent on 29 June 2024. Her friends reported that she had taken MDMA possibly shortly before she entered the festival but she was also seen taking a tablet not long after she arrived at the festival. There had been bag and pat down searches undertaken by security staff for all those entering the festival but no drugs were found in any search she underwent as she would not have been allowed entry. She started behaving erratically and assistance was sought and she was taken to the on site medical tent arriving at approximately 15.23 and was distressed and agitated as well as tachycardic and hyperpyrexial. A set of observations recorded at 15.34 showed a respiratory rate of 28, saturations of 94% on air, a blood pressure of 143/119 and a heart rate of 186 with a temperature of 40.6 degrees and a NEWS score of 9. At 15.43 ambulance crew working for providers at the event were radioed and asked to return to the site to take Emily to hospital. They arrived back at the medical tent shortly after 4pm and are seen leaving the medical tent with the private ambulance crew at 16.16 and they left the site at 16.19. During this time Emily remained hyperpyrexial, tachycardic, distressed and confused and no attempts at reducing her temperature were undertaken. No pre alert call was made to the hospital and the journey was made without lights and sirens. The journey time was approximately 5 or 6 minutes so she arrived at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital at approximately 16.25/6. Emily was then assisted back up the stretcher by a paramedic and there was then a delay in her being triaged due to communication issues between the private ambulance staff and the triage nurse. The paramedic who had assisted in moving Emily recognised the severity of Emily's presentation and assisted with getting her moved to the resuscitation area in the emergency department. She was documented as having been seen by a doctor at 16.45 although the timings were written retrospectively and accounts indicated that as she was wheeled into the resuscitation bay the doctor was present. It was recognised that she was critically unwell and cooling measures were instituted and intravenous benzodiazepines given as she was displaying the ill effects of MDMA toxicity and suffering from serotonin syndrome. Intensive care clinicians were called and the team were preparing to intubate her when she suffered a cardiac arrest and despite efforts at resuscitation which lasted more than an hour she was pronounced dead shortly after 6pm.","(1) Private ambulance providers were used and the training of the staff involved was minimal, the evidence heard indicated that they had a qualification called First Response Emergency Care level 4 which was a five day course and had little experience or training in relation to management of patients having taken drugs. Given that the teams on site were present and ambulances available at a music event where the risk of drug taking was deemed to be high more training should have been provided to assist the staff in how to safely manage those under the influence of illicit substances.

(2) There was a lack of clarity regarding who had responsibility for making a pre alert call to the hospital and given this young girl was significantly unwell this should have been done. This in part may have been due to the lack of recognition of the seriousness of her symptoms and therefore potentially linked with training of staff.

(3) The ambulance did not have the same equipment which an NHS ambulance would have on board and was in essence very little more than a means of transport from the venue to the hospital and may have given a false sense of reassurance."

Spinney,"County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay",Chief Executive – Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust; Chief Executive – Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (Musgrove Park Hospital),On 25 May 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Andrew James Tizard-Varcoe. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on 25-27 March 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was as follows:,"Andrew James Tizard-Varcoe had a complex past medical history. In April 2021 he was diagnosed with the ear infection otitis externa. Between April 2021 and May 2022 he received treatment across three hospital trusts whilst he was also being treated for other health conditions. Despite the treatment the infection progressed and entered the bones in his skull. On 11 May 2022 he died at his home address in Croyde, Devon, due to the progression of the infection.","(1) The evidence shows that Mr Tizard-Varcoe’s overall treatment for the ear infections between April 2021 and May 2022 was provided across three different health trusts and hospitals, Musgrove Park in Taunton, North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple and Exeter Hospital; it is acknowledged that this was as a consequence of Mr Tizard-Varcoe’s vascular disease (being treated at Musgrove Park) and the locations of specialist doctors. Whilst being treated at Musgrove Park for a vascular problem, Mr Tizard-Varcoe consulted with ear nose and throat specialists for ear pain; subsequently between April 2021 and May 2022 he was seen on a number of occasions by clinicians in all three locations; this led to occasions when Mr Tizard-Varcoe was reviewed by clinicians without the full clinical picture due to the inability of separate hospital trusts to access each other’s medical records. The evidence revealed that on occasions it was difficult for Mr Tizard-Varcoe’s GP to work out who had responsibility for his care. It is my judgement that on occasions this led to less than optimal treatment for Mr Tizard-Varcoe.

(2) In addition, the evidence revealed that there were three occasions when Mr Tizard-Varcoe was not followed up as an outpatient in a timely manner (August 2021, November 2021 and February 2022). On one occasion Mr Tizard-Varcoe possibly ran out of antibiotic medication and on another Mr Tizard-Varcoe was discharged without antibiotic medication. The lack of timely follow up appointments resulted in reduced monitoring and assessment and a poor understanding of the effectiveness of treatment and the progression of his ear infection.

(3) In addition, on 1 November 2021, Mr Tizard-Varcoe was discharged from the Royal and Devon Hospital without a prescription for oral antibiotics despite advice from microbiologists to do so; the evidence showed that this was a clinical decision made by a junior ear nose and throat doctor against an improving clinical picture. The discharge was overseen by a consultant from a different specialism due to Mr Tizard-Varcoe’s health needs at the time.

Evidence at the inquest from the responsible ear nose and throat consultant indicated that he would probably have prescribed antibiotics on advice of microbiologists. Due to the progression of the infection from the ear canal into the bone at the base of the skull there is a real possibility that the clinical presentation did not reflect the true situation and this was a missed opportunity to provide continuity of treatment."

Brown,Other,"Department of Health & Social Care; Department of Housing, Community and Local Government; HSE","On 23 May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Wessam al Jundi, age 28. The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not yet been heard.","Diagnosis of severe silicosis lung disease. Awaiting lung transplant. Admitted on Friday 17 May 2024 for potential lung transplant to Harefield Hospital. Had deteriorated since last review with pulmonary hypertension. Bedside echo showed severe pulmonary hypertension with pericardial effusion and left ventricular compromise. Not suitable for transplant as too unwell. Deteriorated and died in hospital on 22 May 2024.

Wessam had been working with artificial stone products which contain a very high percentage of crystalline silica content. The dust created when these products are cut, sanded and carved creates respirable crystalline silica (RCS) and is too fine to see with normal lighting. It is recognised to cause silicosis if inhaled which causes a hardening or scarring of the lung tissue with initially no symptoms. Once silicosis develops it is untreatable apart from offering lung transplantation.","This young man presented with an untreatable lung condition probably caused by exposure to RCS in his workplace. This company, “Yes, Marble Ltd” is no longer trading.

Any current surveillance health and safety monitoring is unlikely to achieve a satisfactory outcome as the onset of untreatable disease predates the 15 year surveillance programmes. In this case exposure appears to have commenced in 5/2016 and he was diagnosed with silicosis in 2021, a mere 5 years after initial exposure.
Evidence from photographs and an in-life statement suggest Wessam was working in completely unsafe conditions to avoid dust exposure.
Australia has already taken the decision in 2024 to ban these artificial stone products.
There are a number of patients in the UK currently awaiting lung transplants due to RCS exposure from their workplaces.

The last 2 decades have seen rapid growth in the use of artificial stone and this death demonstrates the emergence of a severe progressive accelerated form of silicosis.
Many of the companies specialising in the finishing process of working with this product have a small number of employees and there appears to be an absence of safe working conditions, with no adequate water suppression systems for the dust created, inadequate respiratory personal protection equipment and absent or inadequate ventilatory systems. This is therefore continuing to put the workforce at risk of death due to untreatable lung compromise."

Brown,Other,"Home Office, Home Secretary; NHS England; MITIE","On 30 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Frank Steve Rios Ospina. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was

Frank Ospina died by suicide

Cause of death was recorded as

1a Ligature compression of the neck

1c

II Coronary heart disease",<NA>,"(1)  During the inquest evidence was heard about the use of Detention services order 09/2016 Detention centre rule 35 (2)

The purpose of rule 35 of the Detention Centre Rules 2001, as set out in Detention - general guidance (chapter 55), is ‘to ensure that particularly vulnerable detainees are brought to the attention of those with direct responsibility for authorising, maintaining and reviewing detention.

Rule 35 (2) states

2. ‘The medical practitioner shall report to the manager on the case of any detained person he suspects of having suicidal intentions, and the detained person shall be placed under special observation for so long as those suspicions remain, and a record of his treatment and condition shall be kept throughout that time in a manner to be determined by the Secretary of State.

‘The manager shall send a copy of any report under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) to the Secretary of State without delay.

Despite Frank Ospina being witnessed as having made an attempt to take his life, and self-reporting a further attempt during his detention, no R35 report was made.

The GP evidence was that there was a long waiting list of 4 weeks of over 100 individuals who were dealt with in separate dedicated surgeries, that he had only made ""a small number"" of R35 (2) reports and that he would usually await and rely on additional evidence such as that from a Consultant Psychiatrist before submitting a R35 (2) report.  In contrast, the Home Office evidence was that they were ""surprised"" that a R35 report had not been submitted. If it had been it would have been considered by a responsible officer within 2 working days.

There was a clear mismatch between the healthcare and Home Office expectations and practical application of the R35 provisions. HMC was advised that this is under review currently by the Home Office and NHS England and so this report is written to inform and assist that review process by raising the concerns from this inquiry.  HMC would also question the restriction of the report having to be generated by a general practitioner, although detainees were seen by a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals, many of whom could potentially carry out this task.

(2)  Visits. The inquest was advised that Frank Ospina's mother visited him in the Heathrow Immigration Removal Centre on one occasion, and that was conducted as a ""closed"" visit.

Her son was accompanied by 2 Officers and their meeting held behind a glass screen where no physical contact was possible.  The Officers were overhearing the family conversation and making notes.

MITIE who are responsible for the day to day running of the IRC were unaware that a ""closed"" visit had occurred and apologised for this, confirming it was inappropriate and Frank Ospina and his mother should have been allowed to meet in the usual communal area where they could have embraced and had a private conversation.  This was the last time Frank Ospina was seen alive by his mother and the visit greatly distressed her.

HMC is concerned that any ""closed"" visits could take place seemingly without the knowledge and consent of the Duty Manager, that no documentation had to be presented and the ""closed visit"" room was accessible even though rarely required (the inquest was advised it had not been used at all during the past few months).

(3) Frank's mother does not speak English and found it very difficult to arrange a visit. In fact rather than successfully navigate the system, she just turned up and was permitted to see her son as set out above. Telephone calls were not facilitated with an interpreter.  The web site where visits should be booked is entirely and only in English.  This is a facility that by definition detains foreign nationals and predictably some of the family members do not speak English.  A quick check of the local authority website (Hammersmith and Fulham) revealed a full immediate translation facility into over 100 languages, and so this is readily available technology.  The Home Office and MITIE should consider the communications currently available to relatives trying to visit their loved ones and whether these can be improved by reasonable adjustments."

Oakley,London Inner West,NHS England; St George’s University Hospital’s NHS Foundation Trust,"On 9 October 2022 the Senior Coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Samuel Finlay Parkin. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 September 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was: Samuel Finlay Parkin died from hypoxic brain injury following a cardiac arrest caused by midgut volvulus which occurred due to an undiagnosed malrotation which had been present from birth. The treating clinicians’ analysis of Sam’s symptoms and false reassurance from the result of an ultrasound meant further tests which could have diagnosed malrotation were not carried out, leading to a misdiagnosis. The undiagnosed malrotation was therefore not surgically treated. The malrotation caused the volvulus to occur. Had the malrotation been operated on it is likely that the death would not have occurred.","Sam died on 16 September 2022 from hypoxic brain injury following an out of hospital cardiac arrest on the night of 13-14 September, caused by midgut volvulus. The volvulus occurred due to Sam having an undiagnosed malrotation, which had been present since his birth. Sam was seen on multiple occasions at St George’s Hospital over the course of his life – in the Emergency Department in 2013, 2015 and 2016 and as an outpatient in 2016 and 2022. The only time malrotation was listed within the notes as a potential diagnosis was in the ward round notes from his admission in 2015. An ultrasound was done in 2015 but not an upper GI contrast, or barium, study. The ultrasound request (in 2015) from the surgical team did not mention malrotation as a possible diagnosis. The ultrasound report noted that the SMA/SMV axis was normal, but did not comment specifically on malrotation. The evidence of the radiologist, paediatric gastroenterologist and expert witness (a consultant paediatric and neonatal surgeon) was clear that ultrasound cannot exclude malrotation. The clinicians who treated Sam gave evidence that their level of suspicion for malrotation was low. Sam was misdiagnosed. Having considered the evidence, including the opinion of the expert witness, I found that the repeated nature of Sam’s symptoms (in particular, vomiting which was sometimes green and severe abdominal pain) over a number of years meant that an upper GI contrast study should have been carried out to look for malrotation. As is set out in the conclusion, had that test been conducted it is likely that it or further tests (if the barium study had been equivocal) would have identified the malrotation and it would have been treated through surgery, thereby significantly reducing the risk of volvulus and Sam’s ultimate death. The evidence also showed that Sam’s parents were not given sufficient safety netting advice which meant that, due to the misdiagnosis and the information/reassurance that they had received over a number of years of bringing Sam to hospital, they did not bring Sam into hospital earlier when he was, unbeknown to them, suffering from the volvulus that proved to be fatal.

The medical cause of death on the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death was:
1a Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy
1b Cardiac arrest
1c Midgut volvulus","1. St George’s have noted a number of learning outcomes in the course of their M&M process and the Child Death Analysis Form. Whilst I heard evidence of training and informal discussions amongst colleagues both at St George’s and regionally, I consider that action is required to ensure that those learning points are formally considered and disseminated throughout St George’s and more widely in the NHS.
2. In the course of the evidence it became clear that the inclusion of a comment in the ultrasound report that the SMA/SMV axis was normal gave false reassurance regarding malrotation. The consultant paediatric radiologist was clear that she was not looking for malrotation on the USS (as it was not listed as a potential diagnosis on the ultrasound request), that USS cannot be used to exclude malrotation and that noting that the axis was normal was simply a comment on the anatomy seen and was not the radiologist providing information relating to whether or not malrotation was present. It is recorded in the notes of the M&M meeting which took place following Sam’s death and in the evidence that I heard, that although clinicians understood that USS is not the diagnostic test for malrotation and that malrotation will not be seen on an USS in circa 25% of cases, the recording of the axis being normal gave a false reassurance. St George’s has changed their practice of reporting of USS to avoid potential confusion in the future. I consider action is required to ensure proper understanding of the limitations of USS in looking for malrotation, in particular in older children, and to avoid any similar confusion regarding the reporting of USS both in St George’s and across the NHS.
3. Following Sam’s death, St George’s has reduced the “threshold” for requesting of upper GI contrast studies in intermittent abdominal pain and intermittent vomiting. Given the serious nature of the potential risk that malrotation carries (namely of volvulus occurring) I consider action is required across the NHS, following St George’s lead, to ensure that the symptoms of and diagnostic tests for malrotation, particularly in older children is understood. Where the learning in St George’s is informal, I consider action is required to ensure that formal learning takes place within St George’s.
4. St George’s has implemented a change in ‘safety netting’ advice for those with what is thought to be benign abdominal conditions from Paediatric ED (using QR codes), from wards and outpatient clinic. Advice is given in writing that “benign abdominal diagnosis” does not exclude conditions requiring urgent surgical/medical review. This action has been taken for the reasons set out above and action should be taken to ensure the wider NHS considers this learning point.
5. One of the learning actions taken by St George’s is that re-referrals to gastroenterology are reviewed by another consultant in order that a fresh assessment/second opinion may occur, followed by an MDT discussion and the option of transferring back to the original consultant. St George’s feels this may help increase the detection of atypical/unusual presentation of GI conditions, including a later presentation of malrotation. Action is required so that this learning point is considered across the NHS.
6. The evidence before me suggested that there may have been a miscommunication or misunderstandings between the surgical, paediatric and paediatric gastroenterology teams regarding what had and had not been considered and excluded by each during Sam’s admission in 2015. In particular, St George’s written answers to Mr and Mrs Parkin’s question regarding whether there was miscommunication between the treating clinicians was simply “yes”. St George’s has therefore implemented an inpatient (written) referral form to the GI service. Action is required by St George’s and the wider NHS to consider/implement ways to minimise the possibility of miscommunication between teams/in referrals of all disciplines."

Hassell,London Inner North,Commissioner London Fire Brigade,"On 8 August 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Leonard Moaven, aged 61 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 January 2024.

I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide. Dr Moaven jumped from the roof of his block of flats at 5.33pm on 26 July 2023.

He had got onto the roof by using a ladder to reach his attic and, when he got there, punching a hole through the roof tiles.","Before he jumped off the roof, Dr Moaven called the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), who in turn called the London Fire Brigade (LFB).

When police officers tried to negotiate with him, Dr Moaven appeared receptive to the idea of coming down off the roof safely. Police officers were reluctant to suggest that he return the way he had come, as by now it was raining and they were concerned that he would slip, and so he waited on the roof for firefighters to escort him.","1. Dr Moaven rang police at 16:33, exactly one hour before he actually jumped off the roof. Police attended immediately and sought firefighter assistance immediately. However, they reported to me at inquest that there was some delay in the attendance of LFB.

2. Upon attendance, firefighters recognised that their ladders would not reach the roof of the flats and so called for an extended height ladder appliance. This had to travel from further afield and Dr Moaven became more agitated during the wait. It had not arrived at 17:33 when he jumped.

The police were especially concerned that the extended height ladder appliance had not been requested from the outset, given that the call was in respect of a person on the roof of a block of flats.

I did not take evidence from any firefighters at inquest, and so I appreciate that there may be elements of which I am unaware."
