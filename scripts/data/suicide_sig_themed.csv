Whittle,Other,"Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police",On 8 March 2024 an investigation was commenced into the death of Andrew Herrin Dodds. An inquest started on 6 November 2025 and concluded on 7 November 2025.,"Andrew Herrin Dodds was assessed by mental health services at Northern General Hospital on 10 August 2023 after expressing suicidal thoughts. He was discharged and referred to the alcohol care team, GP primary mental health team and provided with details of CRUSE, Andy’s Man Club and IAPT.

Andrew then self referred to the single point of access and was accepted for further crisis assessment. He was deemed high risk and reported a plan to end his own life. He was assessed at the Longley Centre and agreed to further assessment by the Home Treatment Team. On 16 August he attended the Longley Centre but left before he was seen. Sheffield Health and Social Care (SHSC) were concerned as they were unable to contact him and reported this to South Yorkshire Police. Andrew then later contacted SHSC and made an appointment to attend the next day. He did not attend the appointment the next day and his friend stated he had left that morning. SHSC contacted SYP as they were unable to contact him. The Police were unable to contact Andrew and a missing persons report was created for Andrew on 17 August 2023.

SYP were unable to contact Andrew and contacted both his friend and his brother. On 19 August Andrew’s brother contacted SYP to state he was at a hotel and he was located by Police at a hotel in Sheffield.

On 20 August Police were called to a hotel in Sheffield as Andrew was threatening to harm himself. The Police used their s136 Powers to take Andrew to a place of safety for a mental health assessment. SHSC were informed of this by SYP and that he was conveyed to the s136 at Rotherham, Swallownest Court as the s136 in Sheffield was full.

SYP handed over Andrew to Swallownest Court and provided details to them. It is clear from the documentation form that next of kin details were not provided. Andrew’s brother was informed he was at the s136 suite but then despite him being concerned for his brother received no further updates from SYP and was not informed to contact the s136 suite directly. He was under the impression that SYP would keep him updated.

SHSC tried to contact Swallownest Court for any update on the assessment and outcome but did not receive any. I was told they continued to be concerned for Andrew’s welfare.

A mental health act assessment was undertaken that determined he did not require any medical recommendation, there was no evidence of mental illness that required admission or referral to secondary services. No next of kin information was available to them and so no information or communication was made with them either during or following the assessment. The outcome of the assessment was not communicated to SHSC or SYP. Andrew was provided with a taxi to take him to Sheffield Train Station as he stated he was going to stay with his brother.

At Sheffield Train Station he presented himself to the station manager requesting his laptop be given to the Police and stating that he was being followed by a gang from Germany. BTP Officers spoke to Andrew. I was informed that they undertook a PNC check which identified that he was known to mental health services and there was mention of him being suicidal. I was told it did not contain any information that he had recently been a missing person and that he had recently been detained under s136. There was no next of kin details. The BTP Officer emailed the South Yorkshire Police Force Control to check if they had any details about Andrew and he received an email in response which mentioned he believed he was being followed by gangs and had been a missing person a few days previously but this report was now closed. Due to the lack of information they did not contact mental health services for more information or contact next of kin to confirm that Andrew was stating he was making his way to them. They asked him if he felt suicidal and he answered no. I was told they had no reason to believe he was lying and had no reason to hold him therefore they allowed him to get on a train.

SHSC continued to try to contact Swallownest Court for the outcome of the assessment and Andrew to no avail during this period due to their continuing concerns.

Unfortunately on the train Andrew [REDACTED] took his own life. He was found by the train conductor when the train was pulling into Tamworth train station and despite being attended to he was pronounced deceased at the scene.","(1) Police did not pass over relevant details including next of kin to the s136 suite meaning next of kin could not be contacted. They also did not inform next of kin to contact the s136 directly and did not provide any further updates. This happened shortly after a shift change over so whether a full handover was provided between officers to allow this information to be given is not clear.

(2) There was missing information on the PNC check which meant that Andrew was not flagged as recently being held under s136. The further email from force control also did not mention that he was recently detained under s136. I was told if this had been on the system BTP would have contacted mental health services for more information.",False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False

Turner,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove","Chief Executive, NHS England","On 23 January 2025 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joanna Chamberlain. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 November 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that on 23 January 2025, Joanna Chamberlain was found suspended from a ligature at her home address in Hassocks, West Sussex. Emergency services attended but, despite CPR, Joanna was sadly declared to be deceased at the scene. Joanna had experienced suicidal thoughts for many months and had made several previous attempts, but had not been assessed as high risk, in part because no input was sought or received from her family. Her significant physical health conditions more than minimally contributed to her poor mental health. She took her own life also in part because her overwhelming and longstanding mental health issues had never been fully or successfully treated.","The day before her death, Joanna attended clifftops near her home with the intention of jumping but had drawn back and contacted her GP as well as attend a pre-planned assessment with a locum clinical psychiatrist at her local mental health assessment and treatment service unit. The GP contacted the mental health team to ensure Joanna was seen urgently.

Notwithstanding the events of earlier in the day, which followed a recent overdose and other incidents of self-harm involving makeshift ligatures around her neck, the assessment was that Joanna was at moderate risk. The assessment was made largely on Joanna’s immediate presentation, with reference to care notes but no other 3rd party (e.g. GP) or family input.

Whilst a period in a 24 hour ‘Haven’ crisis facility was considered, the plan agreed with and by Joanna was for her to return home, where the presence of her husband and son were powerful protective factors, and receive daily input and support from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team (CRHTT). Joanna had previously been in their care. Joanna did not want to enter a unit as a voluntary patient and nor was this deemed necessary.

Joanna duly returned home, to the great surprise and concern of her husband who had strongly expected her to have been admitted to residential care and treatment. After lengthy discussion with Joanna, he was reconciled to the immediate plan but both he and Joanna felt and hoped the team’s visit the next morning may initiate the process for her to be a voluntary in-patient, despite previous reluctance.

Joanna had withdrawn consent for her confidentiality to be waived as regards her husband 2 days earlier, for fear of her condition and the involvement of mental health services adding to his stress and burden. Even during the periods where she had given consent, however, at no time had he been consulted or included in her care plan. Moreover, at no time had he been informed that, outside and separate to the confidentiality of Joanna’s care, he could have voluntarily provided information and input to the teams involved.

Partly due to the financial pressures on the family occasioned by Joanna’s incapacity for work due to her physical and mental conditions, and in the hope and expectation that the CRHTT would attend, further assess Joanna and help, her husband left for work early the following morning, before the planned attendance of the CRHTT at 10 am. Sadly, this removed a powerful protective factor and Joanna took her own life before the team attended at her address.","Whilst I am keenly aware that it is not for coroners to investigate matters of national public policy or resource, there appears to be a local and national gap in the provision of safe and supportive spaces, where clinical help and care can be given to mental health patients who may not be in immediate crisis yet who would benefit from more support than can be given by home treatment teams. Or whose risk assessment suggests may benefit when protective factors change or are temporarily unavailable at certain times of the day or night.

Equally, whilst I recognise the importance and value in clinicians rapidly assessing a patient’s risk of self-harm, using their individual professional judgement, and forming an immediate care and safety plan, there is a potential need for clearer national guidance on, direction to and protocols for clinicians to proactively seek and include the views and input of family members, or others (e.g. GP), reinforcing the triangle of care, and especially where the delivery or assurance of a care and safety plan depends on them. This appears even more necessary where such individuals themselves are a key protective factor.",True,True,False,True,True,True,True,False

Horstead,Essex,CEO Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust,"On 5 January 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Stephen John Neville, aged 68 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the 9-day article 2 (non-jury) inquest on 23 October 2025.

The conclusion of the inquest was a short form conclusion of ‘Suicide contributed to by neglect’ in conjunction with an expanded narrative conclusion which identified a series of serious failings cumulatively amounting to a gross failure to provide Stephen Neville, a person in a dependent position, with basic medical care. Steve, as he was known, had taken his own life by hanging [REDACTED] whilst an informal inpatient.","On a background of diagnoses of severe (treatment resistant) depression with anxiety and agitation and repeated attempts at suicide and self-harm, with recent and ongoing further deterioration in his mental state, Steve was admitted as an informal patient to Beech (Older Adult) Ward at Rochford Hospital run by Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) on 16 December 2021 for planned Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT). He had been under the care of the Older Adult Community Mental Health Team (OACMHT). His direct admission had bypassed the Trust’s usual referral, gatekeeping and bed management processes, contrary to Trust policy.

An Associate Specialist Psychiatrist (ASP), undertook Steve’s clinical review on 17 December. She was unaware that Steve had been prescribed daily Lorazepam in the community for some 14 months (alongside antidepressant medication). This critical information had not been communicated to her by the OACMHT and neither had she reviewed, as she accepted she could and should have, the available medical records to obtain this information.

In summary form only, the following findings and determinations informed the Conclusion:

• failures to identify and communicate up-to-date risk assessments from (and between) mental health teams in the community and the in-patient team, including but not limited to the very extended duration of the prescribing of Lorazepam prior to admission;
• upon admission, staff failed to appreciate Steve’s longitudinal risk (focusing only on the admission for ECT) and failed to engage with family members to seek further information relevant to Steve’s present risk;
• the doctor conducting the medical review on 17 December failed to read and review readily available medical records prior to making significant decisions regarding medication changes and therefore failed to consider the likely impact on subsequent risk management of such a sudden change to medication;
• the reviewing doctor failed to discuss and explain the abrupt medication changes to Steve and/or his family and failed to formally undertake a risk review or convene an MDT for that purpose;
• the reviewing doctor failed to ensure that the nursing (and therefore support worker) staff were made aware of the abrupt medication changes and the potential impact on Steve’s risk and, consequently, their heightened role in risk management through (ongoing) therapeutic observation and engagement;
• EPUT staff failed to appropriately undertake and document Level 2 therapeutic observation and engagement as per Trust policy;
• EPUT failed to ensure there was in place (then and now) an appropriate and effective auditing and quality assurance process to ensure the nature and quality of the therapeutic observation and engagement undertaken by staff was consistent with Trust policy;
• a failure on the part of the nurse administering medication on the morning of the death to confirm to Steve (who was expecting to receive Lorazepam upon which he, by that stage, depended), that whilst his prescription of Lorazepam had been stopped (until then unbeknownst to him), PRN Lorazepam, albeit at a much-reduced level, (alongside Promethazine PRN) was potentially available;
• a failure to appropriately manage the unlocked shower room, [REDACTED] in which Steve died, by failing to attempt to mitigate the clear risks that his unsupervised access to this room represented. The Trust ‘plan’ for the mitigation of this risk was limited to (a) making all staff aware of the [REDACTED] and (b) undertaking some form of individualised risk assessments and putting in place risk mitigation for individual patients.

There was a failure to mitigate that risk by failing to implement any ‘individualised’ measures relevant to managing Steve’s specific risk, for example by increasing his observation levels and/or removing the cord from his tracksuit bottoms that he had been allowed to retain, including after the abrupt changes to his medication.","1. There was a failure on the part of EPUT nursing and (particularly) support staff to appropriately undertake and record the required therapeutic engagement and interaction observations. Members of support staff demonstrably misunderstood (and appear to still misunderstand) the nature and purpose of Level 2 ‘intermittent’ (4 to 5 times) hourly observations, apparently routinely conducting such observations every 15 minutes on the hour, the quarter past and so on. Whilst the observations, when made, recorded the location of the patient and (very occasionally) noted what the patient may be doing, nothing was recorded in respect of an interaction or therapeutic engagement, as required by Trust policy. Such a lack of understanding of the basic role of the support worker and/or nursing staff in undertaking such critically important roles disclosed an (on-going) deficit in training.

2. Further, the clear evidence also disclosed an on-going failure in the quality assurance and auditing processes deployed by EPUT. A purported weekly quality assurance check being undertaken by the Ward Manager in December 2021, which claimed “an audit score of 100%”, was entirely at odds with the evidence at inquest which revealed repeated and significant inadequacies in the nature and quality of the observations undertaken and recorded.

3. Of even greater concern is that even after the move from paper to electronic observation records the same Beech Ward Manager (then and now) stated in evidence: “I have no audit tool …. I am not confident that the audits are accurate and complete now … there is no audit process in place to check the quality of observation and engagement documentation.”

4. The Deputy Director of Quality and Safety (Inpatient and Urgent Care) recognised in her written and oral evidence that the available free text box now included on the electronic version of the records relating to observation and engagement is “not a mandatory field” in the recording process and that: “it appears that at some point the Tendable audits were amended to omit the audits of the quality and nature of the observation records.”

5. It remains unclear how (or why) this came about, and I am very concerned that the apparent reliance on staff supervision (as per paragraph 7.1 of the Therapeutic Engagement and Supportive Observation Clinical Guideline (Inpatients)) and staff handovers to rigorously audit the nature and quality of the conduct and recording of therapeutic engagement and supportive observations remains a wholly inadequate mechanism for the purposes of achieving appropriate qualitative compliance monitoring.

6. The lacuna identified above gives rise to a real concern regarding the robustness of EPUT quality assurance and auditing processes generally, and particularly in the context of the on-going issues relating to the nature and quality of the conduct by EPUT staff of such critically important observations including the essential therapeutic engagements and interactions, with highly vulnerable inpatients at risk of suicide. This is a concern, I am told, also shared by the Deputy Director quoted above.",True,True,False,False,True,False,True,True

Walker,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton","Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (HIOWH) (Formerly Southern Health, SHFT)","On 13 November 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Abigail Eleanor Ann Jelley who was 34 when she died. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 September 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that Abigail died on 12 November 2024 at work premises below her home address in Waterlooville, Hampshire having intentionally harmed herself causing fatal blood loss. She intended by her act to end her life. The deceased was suffering with post-natal depression and in the weeks leading to her death she asked mental health professionals for help. It was established that there were failings in training, culture and knowledge by some of the professionals charged with Abigail’s care.","Abigail was a 34-year-old mother of two who suffered a crisis in her life from the end of October 2024 until her death a few weeks later. The crisis arose out of post-natal depression following the birth of Abigail’s second child earlier in 2024. During this period she was seen by different mental health professionals whose job it was to react to that crisis and attempt to assist her through it. A review into her death was critical of the care she received, and I heard evidence from those involved in the review. All teams concerned fall under the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare Trust.","Community Mental Health Teams do not receive mandatory training on the perinatal red flags that are used when assessing patients with postnatal mental health issues. The team concerned with Abigail did request training but, a year after Abigail’s death, they had not received it. They were told that an assessment had been made by those senior to them that such training is not mandatory. That women suffer poor mental health before and after giving birth is sadly common and I am concerned that there is a risk of future deaths and that a large and vulnerable group of patients will not receive appropriate care.

The Perinatal Team are expert in assisting patients such as Abigail. However, they are not commissioned to complete urgent visits and must refer patients to the community mental health teams who lack the specialist training and who are likely, due to the reasons outlined above, unaware of the perinatal red flags. I am concerned that women in need will not receive the appropriate mental health care and that there is a risk of future deaths.

Abigail was known to the community mental health services for just a few weeks. She had been living with her parents immediately before she died and they had attended medical appointments with her. Abigail’s parents were not spoken to by mental health professionals about their daughter’s circumstances when they would have been able to provide valuable information about her research into and planning around ending her life. It was accepted that there was a lack of professional curiosity shown by professionals both in Abigail’s case and generally and I am concerned that there is a risk of future deaths.

It was accepted that there were cultural issues within the trust services. A report into Abigail’s death concluded that these included ‘a lack of professional curiosity, lack of escalations of deteriorating patients, non-patient centred decision making and a linear approach to risk assessment and formulation.’ I am concerned that there are structural issues with the leadership of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare Trust that is to the detriment of patients like Abigail, and I am concerned about the risk of future deaths.",True,True,False,True,True,False,False,True

Simpson,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton",CEO - Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust,"On 16 September 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Naomi Aylott aged 46. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 September 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

On 12 September 2024 Naomi Aylott died on the Mid Hants Heritage Railway near Four Marks. She jumped from a railway bridge with the intent to end her own life after suffering from a relatively short period of poor mental health which started after she contracted viral meningitis in July 2023. She had made previous attempts to end her life and spent time under the care of both the crisis and community mental health teams.","In July 2023 Naomi contracted viral meningitis and, whilst she made a full physical recovery from this, she suffered from poor sleep and developed some erratic behaviours. She was initially treated by the GP and her mental health improved by the end of 2023.

However in early 2024 she reported fleeting negative thoughts and on 5 February 2024 attempted suicide. She was swiftly assessed by the Mid and North Hampshire Crisis Home Resolution Team who provided daily interventions until the end of May. By the end of this period Naomi had been assessed as posing a low risk to herself and repeatedly denied any ongoing suicidal thoughts.

Naomi’s care was then transferred to the Andover Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) for long term management of what was thought to be bipolar disorder.

Following her transfer Naomi was not once seen face to face by her care coordinator. No formal risk assessments were completed or updated. No formal care plan was completed nor was a formal crisis plan.

On 6 August 2024 Naomi reported a significant deterioration in her mental health and on 15 August reported suicidal thoughts. The care coordinator still did not prepare a formal risk assessment or see Naomi face to face. She was due to go on holiday and the care coordinator did not arrange any contact with Naomi for her return and left it for her to contact him.

On 9 September Naomi was reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist.

On 12 September Naomi jumped from a railway bridge near her home address.","1. I am concerned that Naomi was never seen face to face by her care co-ordinator over the 3–4 month period that she was under the care of the CMHT.

I heard evidence that the Andover CMHT, in particular, was impacted by a change in the way that primary care networks (PCNs) refer patients to secondary services. Due to Naomi’s GP surgery being within a particular PCN she was referred to the Andover CMHT even though she lived in Four Marks, a 40–50 minute drive from Andover. This is much further than would have been the case had Naomi come under the care of the Winchester CMHT.

The Andover CMHT has not been able to arrange as many face to face appointments with care co-ordinators due to the time they would have to spend travelling.

Naomi’s care was not referred to the Winchester CMHT originally nor was it transferred from the Andover to the Winchester CMHT after the referral was accepted.

2. I am concerned that within the Andover CMHT the training around risk assessments and the auditing of compliance with risk assessment policy is not adequate.

In relation to Naomi I heard evidence that the completion of formal risk assessments was not carried out in accordance with the CMHT policy.

I heard evidence that Andover CMHT had undergone risk assessment training at around the time they were involved in Naomi’s care. Despite this no formal risk assessments were completed. In addition I heard that the process for auditing risk assessment compliance had not identified this failure in respect of Naomi’s care.

I also heard evidence that the Andover CMHT had requested further training from the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Trust but that this had not taken place.

3. I am concerned that the Andover CMHT do not appear to have considered how to keep a person’s family involved in their care (when there is the appropriate consent to do so) when meetings with the care co-ordinator take place over the phone and not face to face.",True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True

Connell,Rutland and North Leicestershire,Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust,On 27 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of James Ralph Cochrane aged 36. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 August 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:,"Mr James Cochrane was diagnosed with Schizophrenia in 2012 following an admission to the Bradgate Mental Health Unit. His diagnosis was later changed to Schizoaffective disorder due to the symptoms of psychosis and mood change that he was experiencing which fluctuated over short periods.
James was initially under the care of the Psychosis and Early Intervention Recovery (PIER) Team before being transferred to the care of Charwood Community Mental Health Team (CCMHT) which continued until James passed away.

During this period James also had three short episodes of care from the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team (CRHTT), the latter being from 25 October 2023 – 7 November 2023. In October 2022 James' medication was changed from Olanzapine to Aripiprazole. James' GP reported that following the change in James' medication he became less sleepy but he in fact became hyperactive and psychotic to a certain extent, and although James lost a lot of weight his mental health issue resurfaced.

James' family shared with the CPN concerns that the change in medication was having a negative impact on his mental health. James' community psychiatric nurse felt that the negative effects of the change in his medication were outweighed by the fact that he was more active. These concerns were not shared with his consultant psychiatrist in the community.

On 25 October 2023 James went to see his GP stating that he was considering self-harm and wanted to jump off a motorway bridge. James was referred to the mental health Central Access Point (CAP), following which he was referred to the CRHTT. James was seen by the CRHTT on seven occasions during which it was reported that although his suicidal thoughts remained they had decreased.

James' Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) indicated by email that it would be preferable for the CRHTT involvement with James to be reduced, due to a risk of over reliance on services. However, evidence was heard from the CRHTT that their input was appropriate at that time. James was discharged from the CRHTT on 7 November 2023. His CPN declined a joint visit and advised that would not have advised James to CRHTT originally, as it made things difficult to have lots of different perspectives.

On the morning of Friday 17 November 2023, James' mother called CCMHT as [REDACTED] had concerns about James as he was presenting with psychotic symptoms.

As James had expressed a wish to alter his CPN, the team lead returned Mrs Cochrane's call, rather than his usual CPN. James' mother told the team lead that James was the worst he had been since his admission to the Bradgate Mental Health Unit 12 years earlier, which is when he previously self-harmed, that he had lost insight and was walking around in circles thinking he was God. The team lead considered it appropriate to review James in person.

Prior to the visit she reviewed James' risk assessment and his recent discharge letter from the CRHTT which referenced the fact that James had been referred to them having reported that he had planned to jump off a bridge and had written a suicide note. She also spoke to the CPN who advised that James had not been a risk to himself for 12 years, and that James' beliefs that he was God were chronic in [REDACTED] nature.

On arrival at James' home at approximately 3.30pm, the team lead initially spoke to James in the absence of his parents. She assessed James as having insight into his mental health. James' brother showed her a video of James that had been taken at 1.21pm in which James was saying that he was God. We have heard evidence that James was potentially in psychosis and lacked capacity at the time of the video.

The team lead only watched the first 19 seconds of the video which lasted 3 minutes and 27 seconds. [REDACTED] did not watch the video in its entirety as [REDACTED] felt uncomfortable, as James appeared uncomfortable and [REDACTED] didn’t have his consent to watch it, albeit [REDACTED] does not believe that [REDACTED] sought James' consent. Having spoken to James, the team lead asked James' parents what had changed since the time of the video and they confirmed that they had managed to talk James round.

They said that the episodes come and go and appear to build to a peak.

The team lead said that [REDACTED] didn’t understand James' baseline. [REDACTED] believed that James' presentation was longstanding, and initially considered that the video may have been staged. However [REDACTED] did not check further with James' usual CPN how this presentation compared to his baseline. Following the meeting the team lead prescribed additional medication, namely Lorazepam, Zopiclone, to assist James with sleeping and to reduce agitation levels for collection the next day, and [REDACTED] advised that he increase his Quetiapine to [REDACTED]. A follow up review was arranged with the CMHT consultant psychiatrist. James' parents were advised to contact the CCMHT on Monday if there was no improvement.

James went to bed and at approximately 21:00 he left home on foot and went to the [REDACTED] overbridge. Having realised that James had left the house, his brother [REDACTED] followed him. James made his way to the [REDACTED] overbridge where he jumped into the oncoming traffic and sadly James subsequently died as a result of the injuries that he sustained.","I indicated at the conclusion of the inquest that I would be making a prevention of future death report in relation to the following three areas:

The extent to which additional evidence such as video footage and carers' views should be taken into account. I heard evidence that work and training has been done to encourage staff to listen to carers' views. However, it remains unclear as to whether any views obtained are subsequently used to inform any follow-up safety plan made by the health care professionals.

The extent to which staff should consider evidence provided in alternative formats such as video evidence. It was acknowledged during the inquest that recordings from mobile phones can provide helpful evidence of a patient's presentation. I understood that a question had been raised internally at the trust as to what extent such evidence should be viewed, and used to inform decisions, however a final decision has not been made. Given the use of mobile phones etc in modern society, I am concerned that there is no clear guidance to staff as to how such evidence should be used.

Support offered to carers who are providing support to mental health patients. It was acknowledged that carers have an important role. I heard evidence regarding mechanisms that have been put in place via SystmOne to record carers' views, but it is unclear as to what checks are in place to ensure that carers are equipped to support patients in their home environment.",True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True

Rogers,London Inner West,"The Chief Executive, South West London and St Georges Mental Health NHS Trust; South West London and St Georges Mental Health Trust","On 4–8 August 2025 evidence was heard touching the death of Gareth Ian Jackson. He died on 22 June 2022 aged 44 years.

How, when, where Gareth Ian Jackson came by his death:

In February 2022 following infection from Covid Gareth Jackson began to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression which led to him seeking medical help from his GP. He was prescribed sertraline in March 2022 but he stopped taking this. He did engage with some talking therapies. He began to deteriorate further during April into May 2022. He was ruminating on failures he perceived at work, and around financial worries. In June 2022 he tied a ligature [REDACTED]. On 13 June 2022 Gareth Jackson travelled to [REDACTED] with the intention to end his life. He did not do so and after speaking to police and a local mental health nurse, he returned to his home in London. Throughout February to June 2022 his wife Donna and his family did all they could to seek help and treatment for him. Later on the night of 13 June into 14 June he was assessed by local mental health nurses and agreed to attend the Coral Unit at Springfield Hospital, Glenburnie Road, SW17 7DJ where he was assessed. It was concluded he was at high risk of suicide. Gareth agreed to remain at the Coral Unit and the plan was to transfer him to the Lotus Unit at the hospital for further assessment. He was transferred to Lotus where he remained until 21 June 2022 which it is admitted was longer than he should have done while waiting for an inpatient bed due to a national bed crisis. He remained at high risk of suicide throughout. He remained a voluntary patient and a plan was made by a consultant psychiatrist from Lotus to admit him to Ward 2 at Springfield, an acute mixed adult psychiatric ward. If he wished to leave the hospital temporarily the plan was he should be escorted by a staff member or his wife. He agreed to this plan. This requirement was included in his treatment plan and was to remain the plan until it was altered by a consultant. On his transfer to Ward 2 there was an inadequate handover and a failure to ensure this part of the plan was communicated properly to nursing staff. On Ward 2 he was assessed by doctors as part of the clerking arrangements and again this part of the plan was inadequately recorded in the clerking notes and not properly handed over to nursing and medical staff. This led to a failure by nursing and medical staff on Ward 2 on 22 June 2022 to properly understand the plan, or to properly review the consultant note of 20 June 2022, and as a result to properly understand the risks Gareth posed to himself and the measures that needed to be in place to protect his life. As a consequence when Gareth requested unescorted leave on 22 June 2022 he was permitted to leave the hospital unescorted because medical and nursing staff had failed to identify the plan for him not to leave unescorted. It is accepted by the Trust that: (i) there was a lack of clear procedure in place for handover on internal transfers at the time of Gareth’s death; (ii) there was a lack of clear procedure in place for handover between outgoing/incoming teams on Ward 2; (iii) there were shortcomings in the record keeping relating to Gareth’s transfer to Ward 2 from Lotus and the communications that followed; (iv) the plan implemented by the consultant psychiatrist on Lotus was not followed pending further senior review on Ward 2; (v) there was a failure to assess Gareth adequately on 22 June 2022 following requests for unescorted leave; (vi) the requests for leave on 22 June 2022 should not have been approved, pending a review by a senior doctor or consultant; (vii) Gareth should not have been granted unescorted leave from the Ward on the occasions this was granted on 22 June 2022 and that had Gareth not been granted unescorted leave on that day his tragic suicide would likely have been prevented.
If the plan from Lotus had been properly identified by nursing and medical staff at handover from Lotus and at any time on Ward 2 prior to him leaving for the second time he would not have been permitted unescorted leave and would not have left the hospital. Instead, Gareth did leave the hospital via a swipe door into the car park where he was permitted to leave by a staff member without challenge. He left the hospital and ran towards the [REDACTED] where he [REDACTED] onto the running lines and rails intending to end his own life where he was struck by a train that had no time to stop. The combination of the fall and strike by the train caused multiple injuries from which he died below at 15:34 on 22 June 2022.

The following matters were causative of Gareth’s death:
(a) The failure by nursing staff to provide an accurate oral and documented handover on 21 June 2022 and thereafter through 21 into 22 June 2022 that effectively communicated Gareth’s plan that he should not have unescorted leave
(b) The failure by nursing staff on Ward 2 on 21 June 2022 to properly review Gareth’s medical notes to identify the plan that he should not leave the ward unescorted including by entry on the whiteboard in the nursing station on Ward 2
(c) The failure by medical staff to ensure the plan that Gareth should not have unescorted leave was clearly communicated to nursing and medical staff after clerking on 21 June 2022
(d) The serious failure by nursing and medical staff on 22 June 2022 to identify the plan that Gareth should not have unescorted leave and as a result the serious failure to adequately risk assess the harm Gareth presented to himself before granting him leave
(e) The failure by nursing and medical staff to speak to Gareth’s family before and after the decisions to grant him leave
(f) The decision to grant Gareth leave by both nursing and medical staff on 22 June 2022
(g) The failure to prevent access by non-staff members to the staff only area of the stairwell leading to the secure door to the car park

The following matters are possibly causative of his death:
(a) The failure to agree and document when Gareth would return from leave on 22 June 2022
(b) The failure by staff to challenge Gareth, a non-staff member in the staff stairs prior to opening the door for him and permitting him to leave on the second occasion on 22 June 2022.

Conclusion of the coroner as to the death:

“On 22 June 2022 Gareth was permitted to leave Ward 2, an acute psychiatric ward at Springfield Hospital by nursing and medical staff when he should not have been. This occurred as a result of failures by nursing and medical staff on 21 and 22 June to properly identify, document and communicate to other staff the plan from 20 June 2022 that any leave should have been escorted. Nursing staff on 21 and 22 June failed to appreciate this plan because it had not been properly handed over and documented on transfer between Lotus Unit and Ward 2, and thereafter was not properly documented or communicated to staff after clerking at each handover prior to death. Nursing staff on Ward 2 failed at any time to identify and understand the plan from Lotus that leave should be escorted. Medical staff on Ward 2 on 22 June also failed to understand this plan and as a result of both nursing staff and medical staff failures to understand the plan and thus carry out a proper risk assessment on 22 June, Gareth was permitted to leave. Both nursing and medical staff on 22 June 2022 failed to communicate the decisions around leave to Gareth’s family and seek their input.
Gareth was able to enter the staff only stairwell through an unlocked door and left the hospital grounds through a swipe operated staff door. He exited through the car park and ran to [REDACTED] where shortly thereafter he took his own life on 22 June 2022 by [REDACTED] onto the tracks below intending to end his life whilst suffering from the effects of a depressive illness and anxiety which affected his otherwise reasonable judgement.”","Of particular significance for the purpose of this report are the following matters:

(1) There were repeated failures by nursing and medical staff to read, understand and replicate plans around safety off the ward or unit, which erroneously led to Gareth being permitted leave when he should not have been.
(2) Part of the reason for this was a lack of joined up policy and risk management around how safety on leaving the unit or ward was being assessed in the case of voluntary patients creating ambiguity according to the RCA review.","I heard evidence that there had been changes to the policies and templates aimed at addressing risk around leave and safety off ward. This was still ongoing. It was accepted in evidence that the acute ward operational policy and leave policy needed to be reviewed again to make sure the various policies including risk management policies were aligned. For example, on the Day 2 checklist for review there was no placeholder for leave/off ward safety management. I was told that there was a positive move to review thinking around risk more as safety rather than simply as risk management, but this was a new concept. I noted that in the templates now used to consider nursing reviews and handovers, there was no specific place to consider leave management and safety around this, expecting it instead to be addressed in the plan – albeit there was a reminder to consider this on the template. To that extent it appeared little substantial had changed from the process before, and the policies remained unaligned. I am concerned that safety planning around leave/going off ward/unit as a voluntary patient has not been given the prominence it requires, as was required in the case of Gareth where the plan for his safety off ward had not been identified by staff on Ward 2 effectively. As such my concern as to future death if this were to not to be unaddressed comprehensively, continues.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

Charles,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton","Secretary of State for Health; Chief Executive Officer, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust",On 28 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Kate YOUNG aged 49. The inquest was concluded on 5 June 2025. The medical cause of death was 1a Hanging.,"On 20 November 2023 Samantha Young died at her home, [REDACTED]. Sadly, she had intentionally taken her own life by hanging herself with a ligature. The background is that Samantha Young had struggled for a number of years with her mental health. She had, impressively, managed to control an alcohol addiction and had indeed stopped taking alcohol. At the time of her death she was under very great stress following marriage breakdown and relocation. She had attempted suicide before. She was under the care of the CMHT, she had been and continued to access private medical care, which was undoubtedly beneficial. She had received substantial and effective family support. Her condition had deteriorated in early November 2023. It is clear that she had made many attempts – successfully so - to access medical treatment, and statutory service support right to the end whilst battling her mental health issues. She had done all she could to help herself and remain in the life of her daughter.","A. Assessment of the risk that a patient poses to themselves or others is clearly a cornerstone of the work of an NHS Trust dealing with mental health. At the material time there was a lack of any training as to completion of risk assessments. I was informed by a senior manager of Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust that with the translation of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust into the new Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that issue of training is being addressed. However it emerged at the inquest that there do not appear to be any firm plans to train agency staff. Agency staff form a significant percentage of frontline staff.

Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust should review its provision of training for agency staff, in particular in respect of risk assessments.

B. Wider family and friends of the deceased perspective were not contacted. A patient's family and friends are clearly an invaluable resource for learning more about a patient's mental health and specifically risk to life, the support available to the patient and the potential for synergistic support with the NHS Trust. This PFD is not the first time that the issue has been raised with Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust: in 2023 the Senior Coroner for Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton issued a PFD on similar grounds arising out of the inquest into the death of Kirsty Taylor. The Senior Coroner observed in the PFD that ""I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being sufficiently, effectively and meaningfully listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatment or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions."" Moreover, in 2021 a report commissioned by NHS England into Southern Health Foundation Trust similarly reported on shortfall in communication with families.

Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare NHS Trust should review guidelines and procedures concerning communication with family and friends of patients with mental health difficulties by its permanent and agency staff, and monitoring of whether such communication has taken place.",False,False,True,True,True,False,False,True

Sowersby,Avon,Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset; Chief Constable of Surrey; College of Policing,"On 28 June 2023 my office commenced an investigation into the death of Amy Anne Levy.

The investigation concluded at the end of a 5-day inquest on 6 June 2025.

The conclusion of the jury who heard the inquest was –

‘Amy took a deliberate overdose of prescription drugs on 18 June 2023. It is not possible to know her true intent.’

Police were notified at the time of her overdose but Amy’s whereabouts were unknown: much of the evidence in the inquest centred on their attempts to find her address so that emergency services could be sent to help her.

This was an article 2 inquest, and in recording how Amy died the jury identified ‘a catalogue of missed opportunities to obtain Amy’s correct address’ by various bodies including Surrey Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary.

The jury also concluded that if not for those missed opportunities Amy would probably have survived.","At the time of her death Amy was a 22-year-old student at the University of the West of England (UWE), living at a term-time address in Bristol.

While she was in Bristol (on 18 June 2023) she called a friend, took an overdose of prescription drugs, and then steadily deteriorated while remaining on the phone – initially becoming unresponsive and later appearing to stop breathing.

Surrey Police were informed of the situation via a 999 call.

In the ensuing period of over 2 hours before Amy was found Surrey Police and Avon and Somerset Constabulary both tried to obtain her correct address.

As part of that effort calls were made by police (i) to Amy’s family home in Surrey, and (ii) to her mother’s mobile phone.

Each call came through with ‘no caller ID’ and went unanswered.

Both police forces knew that Amy had taken an overdose at an unknown address and that her condition was deteriorating. Both forces had graded Amy’s case as requiring an ‘immediate’ response (the most urgent category).

Despite that factual background, none of the officers or call handlers who phoned Amy’s parents left a voicemail message.

Having missed the call/s (from an unknown source or sources) Amy’s parents did not know that there was an emergency, or that the police wanted to speak with them, and had no way of calling back whoever had called them.

It is probable that Amy’s location could have been obtained earlier than it was if the police had left a suitably worded voicemail for one or more of her parents.

Amy died in hospital on 22 June 2023. The medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a) Hypoxic brain injury
1b) Quetiapine and zopiclone overdose
2) Depression","With limited or no guidance, training or policy on when police and/or police support staff liaising with the public should leave a voicemail (particularly in circumstances where they are trying to obtain important information in a time-pressured situation), I am concerned that there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and in the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

In addition there was no attempt to gain input from his family into the reality of the situation in relation to his mental health. The evidence given by his family at the inquest was that they could have provided valuable information into the clinical assessment but did not feel they had the opportunity to provide this information.
The consequence of these two factors was that his risk was not recognised.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. The medical cause of death was hanging.","Cain Donald died on 29 July 2022 by hanging. Prior to his death, Mr Donald had been released from prison in December 2019 and remained on Probation. He experienced a decline in his mental health in June 2022, exhibiting paranoid behaviour and using substances. He was admitted to Ashurst Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) on 28 June 2022 and was discharged directly into the community on 19 July 2022 following a decision by a Mental Health Review Tribunal. Following discharge, he was receiving support from the Crisis Home Treatment Team (CRHTT). The inquest specifically focused on the events preceding his death, particularly his discharge planning, the involvement of the Probation Services and his family, and the role of the CRHTT, including medication administration. I found deficiencies in the planning and execution of his discharge.","Planning of discharge from detention under the Mental Health Act at Ashurst PICU directly into the community.

(1) The evidence revealed deficiencies in the way Mr Donald’s discharge was planned and executed, specifically that his family and the Probation Services were not properly engaged in the discharge planning process when they were considered important mitigations in any risk Mr Donald posed to himself.
(2) There was insufficient communication and liaison with family members, including explaining Mr Donald’s condition and risks on discharge and providing support to his partner as a carer. The Probation Service was not informed of the discharge meeting and should have been invited and participated; and Mr Donald’s family were unable to contribute effectively to the discharge process.

My principal concern was that the Trust’s Discharge Policy did not seem to specifically envisage discharge to the community by a Tribunal directly from the PICU. Such a decision necessitates rapid coordination of complex discharge arrangements and effective engagement of relevant agencies and the family, which was absent in Mr Donald’s discharge. Whilst the Trust has taken some action to acknowledge these issues, I remain concerned that the specific issues outlined above have not been adequately addressed.

Post-discharge management of risk arising from medication compliance and multi-disciplinary team review.

(3) Evidence suggested that during the period immediately prior to Mr Donald’s death, staff of the CRHTT did not implement specific instructions to supervise Mr Donald taking his medication. By 24 July 2022, a decision had been made that Mr Donald should be supervised when taking his medication, but this direction was not adhered to in the following days. Escalation of this issue did not occur. There was no evidence of steps taken by the Trust since Mr Donald’s death by way of training or guidance to CRHTT staff to address these issues. My conclusion was that had supervision and escalation taken place, it is possible this may have prevented a deterioration in Mr Donald’s mental health which led to his death.",True,True,True,False,True,False,True,False

I recorded a conclusion that Callum died from suicide.","Callum was sexually assaulted as a child. In his adult years, he developed substance misuse/addiction issues and it is likely he presented with complex PTSD or EUPD.
He lived in social housing at Silverdale Court in Newquay. From approximately 2020, there started to be concerns that Callum was being cuckooed. In 2023, following the receipt of safeguarding alerts, it became apparent substantial damage had been caused at the flat which was uninhabitable. Callum was sleeping rough elsewhere. Temporary accommodation was arranged in Roche and Wadebridge but Callum was not allowed to remain at the addresses after drug paraphernalia was discovered. Callum continued to sleep rough apart from a short period when he was housed by the local authority under a severe weather protocol. In early 2024, a Notice Seeking Possession of the flat at Silverdale Court was served on Callum.
On 19/1/24, Callum was seen in a distressed state having been involved in an altercation and complaining that his medication had been stolen. He went to a cliff edge in Newquay. Police attended and eventually removed Callum from the cliff. He was taken to a place of safety by police and underwent a mental health act assessment. He was determined not to be presenting with a severe and enduring mental illness of a nature and degree to warrant detention in hospital. Further, by the end of the period of assessment Callum’s risk to himself was not felt to be sufficiently imminent or significant to justify short-term detention.
Callum was discharged and provided with a taxi to take him back to his emergency accommodation. There was a discussion about whether Callum wanted members of his family informed of his discharge. Callum said that he did not and this decision was not tested or challenged. It was not felt appropriate to breach the duties of confidentiality owed to Callum in this regard.
Callum’s body was recovered from the sea at a location known locally as [REDACTED] in Newquay on 20/1/24. He had suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height. Additionally, post-mortem toxicology revealed evidence of cocaine metabolites, diazepam, mirtazapene, pregabalin, zopiclone and methadone. The methadone in particular was at a high level and sufficient to have caused death on its own. The pregabalin and zopiclone were also present at high levels.
On the evidence, I found it was more likely than not that Callum had jumped or fallen from the cliffs with the intention of ending his own life.","1) It was accepted in evidence that, owing to the decisions made by Callum, there were only limited options available to the clinicians. Of note, an offer to have personal follow-up by one of the clinicians involved in the assessment through the HTT was rejected. Additionally, the possibility of prescribing additional Diazepam was correctly discounted once it became evident Callum was already sourcing illicitly more than could be prescribed safely.
2) Callum refused permission for his mother (described as his rock) to be informed of his imminent discharge. On her evidence, she had been (wrongly) advised by police that her son would be detained and was safe. There was no evidence that this decision by Callum was explored or tested by the clinicians – instead it simply appeared to have been accepted by the clinicians without further enquiry. The independent expert was of the view that in a situation like this, where the assessing team had very few ‘levers’ available to it, Callum’s mother was potentially one that could and should have been explored further.
It was noted that GMC guidance allows for further enquiry, specifically that 58. If an adult patient who has capacity to make the decision refuses to consent to information being disclosed that you consider necessary for their protection, you should explore their reasons for this.

1) One issue that arose was whether Callum presented with an imminent and significant risk of harm to justify a short-term admission into hospital as is provided for in NICE guidance. Ms Ashton said this was expressly discussed by the clinicians concerned. It was felt he was likely to be withdrawing and there were no resuscitation facilities available in Longreach. She also said the vulnerabilities of others on the ward needed to be considered all of which contributed to the decision not to detain Callum in hospital. She accepted that this rationale was not recorded in the notes.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical cause of death being pressure on the neck due to hanging.","The Deceased had a long history of mental health problems. These came to the fore in late 2024. The Deceased was under the care of mental health services both in the community and, for a short period of time, as a voluntary in-patient on a psychiatric ward.

On 6 January 2025 the Deceased was due to attend an important meeting and when she did not turn up for that meeting there was serious concern for her welfare. Four calls were made to the police that day to request that they attend the Deceased’s home address to check on her welfare. However, due to the “Right Care, Right Person” assessment, the police refused to attend.

The first call was made by a social worker at 15:46, expressing concerns that:
1. The Deceased had not attended family contact with her children, which was very out of the ordinary.
2. There was no reply at the Deceased’s home address, but the Deceased’s dog was present inside.
3. The Deceased’s phone was switched off.
4. None of the Deceased’s family had a key to the property.
5. The Deceased had a history of mental health problems and had attempted suicide on numerous occasions.
The “Right Care Right Person” decision was no. The social worker was advised by the call handler to ring the ambulance service. The call handler also said that they would speak to their supervisor for the decision to be reviewed.

The second call was made by the Deceased’s mother at 16:38. The call was made on the 999 number. The call handler asked the Deceased’s mother if the Deceased had made a threat of suicide today and when the Deceased’s mother said that she hadn’t, the call handler advised the Deceased’s mother to call back on 101. It was acknowledged at the inquest that it was not best practice to have asked the caller to call back on 101.

The third call was made by the Deceased’s mother (on the 101 number) at 16:44, expressing concerns that:
1. The Deceased had a history of mental ill-health and suicide attempts.
2. The Deceased was meant to attend family contact time that day and hadn’t. The Deceased never missed family contact time.
3. No one had spoken to the Deceased since Saturday (4 January 2025).
4. Family had attended the house and the Deceased was not answering the door, but the dog was inside and the Deceased would not usually leave the dog alone for that long.
5. The same lights had been on in the property since Saturday (4 January 2025) and the Deceased did not usually leave the lights on.
6. A chewed up teddy bear could be seen on the living room floor and the Deceased would not normally leave a chewed up teddy bear on the floor for fear that it would choke the dog.
7. The Deceased’s phone was going straight to voicemail.
8. To the direct question of was there a real and immediate risk to the Deceased’s life the Deceased’s mother said yes, because the police have had to cut the Deceased down before from previous suicide attempts.
9. The Deceased’s mother informed the call handler of the police also attending suicide attempts at the train lines.
10. The Deceased had recently been reading court papers, which can cause her to spiral downwards.
11. The Deceased had previously attempted suicide with no warning.
The “Right Care Right Person” decision was no. The Deceased’s mother was advised to call the Mental Health Crisis team or NHS 111. The Deceased’s mother said that the social worker had already contacted mental health services and that the social worker had advised the Deceased’s mother to call the police to see if they could do a welfare check. The call handler said that the “Right Care, Right Person” decision was still no, but the decision would be reviewed by supervision.

The fourth call was made by a social worker at 16:57, expressing concerns that:
1. The Deceased was vulnerable and over the past six months had attempted to end her life many times.
2. The Deceased was due to attend family contact time and had not turned up and she would never miss family contact time and this was really concerning.
3. The family had attended the Deceased’s address and the dog was barking inside, but there was no sign of the Deceased.
4. The lack of contact was unusual, as often the Deceased would cry out for help and contact the Crisis team.
5. The police had had to break the door down previously to get in to cut the Deceased down.
The call handler said that she could not confirm if a welfare check would be done.

Very shortly after this the Deceased’s family forced entry into the Deceased’s home address, and found the Deceased hanging by a ligature [REDACTED].","(1) During the 16:44 call, by following the “Right Care, Right Person” procedure there was a refusal to the request that the police attend, even when a family member was expressing the view that there was a real and immediate risk to life.
(2) During the 16:44 call the “Right Care, Right Person” advice to contact mental health services appears to have disregarded the fact that the mental health crisis team do not have the power to enter locked premises and so would require police attendance to facilitate entry to the premises.
(3) During the 16:57 call there was no decision for police to attend, even though this was the third caller (and second professional caller) that had expressed serious concerns about the Deceased.

II","Robert Maxwell Smith died on 26 October 2023 at [REDACTED], Cardiff. Mr Smith died by hanging [REDACTED]. It is more likely than not that he intended the consequences of his action to result in his own death.

Mr Smith had recent contact and intervention from mental health services and was known to be at risk of suicide due to a deterioration in his mental health presentation over the preceding weeks. Mental health services did not inform Mr Smith’s wife of the extent of his suicidal ideations. Mr Smith had indicated that he would inform his wife of his raised suicidal ideations but did not do so. On balance, it cannot be said that if such information had been provided, Mr Smith’s suicide would have been prevented.

Conclusion: Suicide","1. The guidance provided to clinicians and nursing staff within the mental health services as to when information sharing and information gathering was to be undertaken with, and from, family members and how such decisions are to be recorded on the standard forms lacked clarity, particularly as regards the distinction between information sharing and information gathering. Such guidance being of relevance when a patient has given consent for information sharing and gathering to take place and when, and in what circumstances, such steps would be taken.

2. The information leaflet provided to patients lacked sufficient detail of the approach taken by mental health services on the issue of information sharing and information gathering so that patients could readily understand the difference between the two and understand when the need for information sharing and/or gathering could arise and what steps would be taken by mental health services.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

Marsh,Somerset,Somerset Foundation Trust; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; Royal College of General Practitioners; NHS England; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,"On 6 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Anne Potter, aged 54, (known as “Anne”).
The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 March 2025.
The conclusion of the jury inquest was a short form conclusion of Suicide in box 4.

The jury’s answer to ‘when, where and how’ was recorded in box 3 of the Record of Inquest as follows:

“Anne was a 54 year old menopausal woman experiencing a number of stresses in her life. The menopause contributed to her mental health decline and exacerbated her underlying anxiety.
On 27 September 2002, Anne took an overdose of paracetamol. She was taken to Yeovil District Hospital where she received treatment. She then received daily community mental health support.
After found wandering in traffic and absconding from her home, on 20 October 2022, she agreed to a voluntary admission to Rowan Ward. She was then detained on a section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. On 21 October 2022 this was upgraded to a section 2 detention.
On 24 October 2022, she was granted her first Section 17 Leave. On 31 October 2022, on a walk with a Health Care Assistant, Anne attempted to run into the road. On 16 November 2022, due to a number of incidents and no possible community support options, she was upgraded to a Section 3 detention.
During her review on 29 November 2022, Anne was authorised for Section 17 Leave for an overnight stay at home on 4 December 2022. On 3 December 2022 she had a day with her family in Bristol. On the morning of 4 December 2022, following staff assessment of Anne, the overnight leave was granted. Anne’s family did not receive appropriate information to assist them in keeping Anne safe for an overnight stay.
She went home on 4 December 2022 and in the morning of 5 December 2022 Anne used a key to open the back door, took a car key and drove away. Anne was driving on the eastbound carriageway of the A303 and at 07:48 she deliberately drove into the path of a HGV tank lorry on the opposite carriageway.”

The medical cause of death was recorded as:
Ia) Multiple traumatic injuries","Anne first presented to her GP in 2008. During this year she had three separate appointments relating to underlying anxiety and being unable to cope. There was no secondary mental health service involvement, nor was there any prescription of anti-depressants at this time.
Anne presented to the GP again in 2014, so six years later. Her presentation at this time was felt by the GP to be a grief/bereavement reaction.

From early 2017 up to the end of 2019 there were five separate consultations for gynaecological and/or gastroenterological presentations but despite secondary investigations, no underlying physiological cause was found and the GP felt that there was a high possibility that her tummy and bowel issues were related to her underlying anxiety.

On the 18 December 2020, Anne had her first significant consultation about mental health symptoms. She was extremely anxious and low in mood and stressed with life in general.
On the 11 January 2021 Anne was emotionally fragile, anxious and stressed. This was the first consultation at which menopause (or perimenopause) was mentioned. Given her presentation it would appear that her underlying anxiety had been slowly building; possibly since 2008 but much more so since 2017. Anne started taking Sertraline in February 2021 (she was prescribed this in the January but was too anxious about side effects to start taking it). She was also started on HRT.

By the end of May 2021 her symptoms appeared to be under control but it was impossible to know if this was the Sertraline, the HRT or a combination of both. In July of 2021, following consultation with her GP, the dose of Sertraline was titrated down so that by the autumn of 2021 she had stopped taking this medication altogether.

In early September 2022, Anne’s presentation declined again and she agreed to re-start Sertraline. On the 27 September 2022 Anne was at home with her husband when she informed him she’d taken [REDACTED] tablets. This was the first time Anne had done anything like this before and it was very much the start of her acute decline. After discharge from hospital she was seen daily by the mental health team, and declined an admission.

On the 20 October 2022, Anne did agree to a voluntary admission to an acute psychiatric unit. This was after she had been returned home by the police who responded to a member of the public who had called in after finding her wandering in traffic. Anne was detained under section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. She remained detained up till the date of her death; being placed on a Section 2 detention and this was upgraded to a Section 3 detention on the 16 November 2022.

Anne had a devoted and supportive husband and family, who were keen to be involved in her care and recovery; so much so that Anne started taking section 17 leave from the 24 October 2022 (3 days after she was detained). She would take escorted leave with either the staff or her husband in the local area for a couple of hours (gradually increasing up to 6 hours at a time).

On the 31 October 2022 whilst out with staff Anne ran into the road and was pulled back by the Health Care Assistant. It was never established what Anne was actually trying to do on this occasion; whether she was trying to harm herself or whether she was simply trying to avoid going back to the ward as she did not like the ward environment and had said that she would rather be at home with her husband. She remained on the ward without leave for three days after this incident.

On the 29 November 2022 an MDT (Multi Disciplinary Meeting) took place. At this meeting section 17 overnight leave was authorised for the 4 December 2022 on the basis that there had been no incidents of risky behaviour and/or absconding (with the exception of the 31 October 2022) and since that incident leave between the 4 and 29 November 2022 had gone ‘well’. Both Anne and her husband were keen for overnight leave and it was felt entirely appropriate to support this wish as part of her recovery.

Anne went out for 6 hours on the 3 December 2022 to a Christmas market in Bristol with her husband. This leave went well and without incident. Anne appeared brighter; she was showing future planning with her family for the forthcoming Christmas period and was commenting on finding pleasure and enjoyment in things again (the mental health team highlighted her enjoyment at watching Strictly Come Dancing which whilst small, highlighted a departure from her previous anhedonia).

Anne was assessed by a mental health nurse prior to her overnight leave on the 4 December 2022. There were no concerning or alarming features or presentation that would have given the nurse (or the entire mental health team involved in her care) any clinical reason to withhold her planned leave. The entire treating team were all very clear that there was no reason to not “let her out” that day. Her husband came to collect her at just after 10am that morning. He was not given any formal or codified ‘Risk Assessment’ document, but he had been very heavily involved in his wife’s care and treatment every step of the way and so the evidence was clear; even if he had been given such a document it would not have contained any information or details that wasn’t already within his knowledge.

Overnight the leave appeared to go well. Anne’s husband had locked the doors and windows and hidden those keys in a desk drawer. He did not hide the car keys as he did not think for one minute that his wife would take the car. That morning Anne found the back door key in the desk drawer and took the car. She was seen driving erratically by multiple other road users who were travelling eastbound on the A303 that morning. At around 07:48 Anne drove her car into the path of a fully laden HGV tanker travelling on the westbound carriageway. There was nothing the tanker driver could have done to avoid the collision. Anne died instantly of multiple traumatic injuries.

It came to light after Anne’s death that she had been using her own personal device (mobile or tablet) to access websites pertaining to self harm. It is unknown whether she had accessed the psychiatric unit’s wifi or whether she had made searches using her own personal data from her phone provider contract.","Part 1

(1) Anne was not sent home for her first overnight leave with any codified ‘Risk’ and ‘Safety Planning’ document. Whilst it was widely accepted in this case that Anne’s husband was well versed and knowledgeable about his wife’s risk and the measures that might be necessary to help keep her safe whilst she was at home, not all families are as involved in their loved one’s psychiatric care, despite the Trust following the Triangle of Care principles.

Whilst families are not mental health practitioners and are not expected to adopt that role within the community there appears to be an opportunity to supply families with a short, codified document dealing with salient points of risks and safety planning when a patient goes for their first overnight leave since being detained. This may equip families with the knowledge to spot signs of declining mental presentation and/or risk and provide them with the knowledge and/or tools to take appropriate steps to assist in safeguarding their loved ones whilst they are in the community.
This concern (and any action deemed appropriate by the recipients of this PFD) is not intended to override autonomy of the patient and their own ability/responsibility to keep themselves safe, but the concern centres around there being an opportunity to assist families in spotting early warning signs that ‘something is wrong’ and to seek help and intervention (if/when appropriate) to minimise the risk of a patient taking their own life whilst in the community.

(2) It transpired during the inquest that if an in-patient (detained or voluntary) accesses the secure unit Wi-Fi there are no algorithms or ‘search detection features’ to prevent access to websites pertaining to self harm and so these can be readily accessed by a group who are already vulnerable due to their acute mental health presentation with some element of inherent risk of suicide. It was noted, quite rightly, by legal representatives that workplace organisations can block access to certain sites they deem it undesirable for their workforce to access (such as sites relating to gambling, sexually inappropriate content etc) which shows that it is possible to limit access to certain websites and content when using a Wi-Fi provider. By allowing an already vulnerable group to have unfettered access to websites dedicated to self harm creates a risk of further deaths.

Part 2

(3) I am (and remain, having previously issued a PFD in a similar vein on 26 June 2024) concerned about the lack of ‘importance’ given to menopausal care available to women on the NHS; especially when compared to private sector meaning that women who are not fortunate enough to be able to access private clinics and facilities may not be able to access the services and expertise they need at a very crucial transitional phase in their lives. Menopause is not a lifestyle choice, it is an unavoidable part of a woman’s natural biological cycle. Without wishing to make sweeping generalisations, menopause is likely to affect 50% of the population at some point in their lives [according to Statistics Times, women made up 50.75% of the UK population in 2024].

I am concerned that:

(i) Certain elements of medicine and clinical practice training are compulsory but having heard evidence at the inquest around mandatory and statutory training modules I learnt that this covers areas such as GDPR training and disposal of sharp objects such as syringes. I was surprised to learn that menopausal training is not mandatory in any area of clinical practice or specialism. I am concerned that there is no requirement to undertake essential compulsory menopausal training for those working in ‘relevant’ clinical practices such as Mental Health Practice, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Oncology, or even as a general GP.

(ii) I was told that the Trust has just one ‘menopause specialist’ (a GP) who covers the entire Trust operations. Not all GP surgeries have a menopause specialist practitioner (or access to one) despite a GP usually being the first port of call for women in the community when seeking primary care. Those GP surgeries who do have a practitioner who acts as a ‘specialist’ is often a GP with a personal interest who has taken the initiative to go on courses and broaden their learning and understanding, rather than any mandatory requirement for a surgery [or group with multiple surgeries] to have an available community ‘front-line’ specialist.

I was told that the Trust does not have an “expert” in this field and it would be difficult to have one as menopause isn’t a disease or an illness. Whilst I do not dispute that it is not a disease, menopause is a condition; it does have symptoms and it does have recognised presentations, yet there appears to be a failure to recognise this condition as having equal importance to other ailments or diagnoses.

I was told during a previous PFD response relating to menopausal knowledge and care within the NHS that “It is important to ensure that women understand common symptoms such as anxiety, stress and depression which they might experience during the menopause and where and when to seek help. The NHS website has resources….” This emphasises my concerns entirely; the lack of importance given to menopausal symptoms. If someone has concerns about heart disease, a worrying lump, a broken bone etc they expect to be able to consult a medically qualified professional who has a knowledge and understanding of their condition or presentation and can diagnose and treat accordingly; not just [and I paraphrase] ‘have a look at a website to help’.

I appreciate that each and every woman will experience perimenopause and menopause differently, their individual experience is unique to them and this, to some degree, creates difficulties as a ‘one size fits all’ approach (which is perhaps achievable in other medical specialisms and disciplines) cannot be offered, but the lack of recognition of the importance of this condition remains a significant concern. I had previously been told (back in a 2024 PFD response) of a roll-out of specialist menopausal care and upskilling of GPs but there was little evidence during the inquest that this has happened/is happening and women continue to approach and navigate the menopause without the support of expert clinicians or practitioners who understand and can treat the symptoms they are experiencing.",True,True,True,False,True,False,False,True

Horstead,Essex,"[REDACTED], Director Adult Social Care Mid Alliance Safeguarding, MCA and DoLS, Essex County Council","On 24 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Linda Marilyn Sitch, aged 75 years. The investigation concluded at the end of a three day inquest on 3 April 2025. Mrs Sitch died at Broomfield Hospital, Court Road, Chelmsford, Essex. The medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a overdose.

My narrative conclusion confirmed that Mrs Sitch (hereafter ‘Linda’) had taken her own life on a background of the impact upon her emotional and mental health well-being of looking after her elderly husband (with whom she had shared a long and happy marriage) and who, himself, suffered from significant ongoing mental and physical health problems. The narrative conclusion included a summary chronology of the involvement of Adult Social Care with Linda over the last six weeks or so of life.

During my summing-up, when providing my findings and determinations, I made it clear that the failings identified in the course of the inquest, although very possibly contributed to the death, I did not find, in the specific circumstances, that they were probably more than minimally causative of the death.","Linda’s husband had been suffering from significant physical and mental health challenges for more than a year or so prior to her death; the impact of aspects of his initial presentation deeply affected Linda, to the extent that she attempted to take her own life on three occasions in October 2022. This led to her admission as a voluntary in-patient at a Mental Health facility under the care of Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT). She received a diagnosis of an ‘Adjustment Disorder’. She was discharged to the care of the Community Mental Health Team in February 2023 and remained largely stable in her presentation through until the late summer of 2023. Her husband, having himself been detained under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983, was discharged back to the family home in June 2023.

On 29 September 2023 Linda’s husband’s EPUT Care Coordinator raised an Adult Safeguarding (ASG) concern with Essex County Council’s Adult Social Care (ASC) regarding Linda’s potential (unintentional) maladministration of her husband’s medication. The referral contained details of Linda’s own history of overdosing and the concerns of family members relating to Linda’s presentation and her ability to care for her husband. By the time of her death on 11 November, no action had been taken by ASC regarding this Safeguarding referral.

On 2 October 2023 a further referral was received from the same CPN requesting a Care Act (2014) Carer’s Assessment for Linda. The referral again informed ASC that Linda was struggling with caring for John. Without apparently considering the ASG referral, this further referral was subsequently erroneously downgraded by the Community Team Manager from Priority 1 (requiring an immediate response) to Priority 2 (response within 28 days). The rationale for so doing was not recorded, as it should have been. By the time of her death no further action had been taken by ASC regarding the referral for a carer’s assessment.

On 16 October further contact was made by Linda’s daughter chasing up the 2 October referral, re-emphasising the escalating and serious family concerns regarding Linda’s presentation, reiterating that Linda had attempted suicide the previous year and expressing concerns that Linda was exceptionally stressed and needed a break. As a consequence of (admitted) human error this information was not acted upon. Had it been reviewed the priority level would have been changed back to Priority 1 and there would have been immediate action, within 24 to 48 hours. Options would likely have included, inter alia, interim carers or residential respite. This would also have been an opportunity to establish if Linda had need in her own right. By the time of her death no further action had been taken by ASC regarding this additional contact.

On 7 November Linda’s husband was admitted to hospital for a medical issue; he was due to be discharged the following week. Prior to his discharge home, Linda took her own life.","a. Although not determined to be probably causative of the death, by the date of Linda’s death ASC had failed to respond substantively or at all to the Adult Safeguarding Referral dated 29/9/2023; the referral for a Carer’s Assessment for Linda herself, received by ASC on 2/10/2023; the concerns reiterated by Linda’s family when chasing the 2/10/2023 referral on 16/10/2023. These failures were explained as ‘human error’.

b. The oral evidence of the ASC Service Manager at the inquest (though not mentioned in her statement prepared for the purposes of the inquest), confirmed that the Team Manager responsible for downgrading the Priority 1 status of the carer’s assessment referral on 2/10/2023 to Priority 2, without recording a rationale, had likely done so without undertaking the required consideration of either the readily available ASG referral of the 29/9/2023, or the Mental Health Act assessment of Linda herself from the previous year. She agreed that, had an estimated “ten minute” review of the “slim files” for both Linda and her husband been undertaken, as should have happened, the Priority level could not and would not have been reasonably downgraded. She accordingly accepted that, in fact, (and contrary to her witness statement) the decision to downgrade to Priority 2 was capable of being determined, by her as an ASC Service Manager, to be ‘inappropriate’.

c. Nonetheless, the ASC Service Manager remained personally “reassured” that a change in Team Manager - along with reminders to personnel of best practice - had sufficiently addressed issues identified by the inquest proceedings.

d. In contrast to this view, I remain concerned that ASC continues to lack a robust system to ensure sufficiently rigorous oversight, including active auditing, capable of identifying the kind of sub-optimal managerial level performance as has been brought to the fore in this case. A change in personnel and moves towards “embedding best practice” do not, in my opinion, sufficiently address this systemic lacuna given that the effectiveness of such changes will still rely very substantially upon the performance of any Team Manager and/or a Deputy Team Manager. There appears to me to be a continuing lack of robust Service level oversight of those managers themselves, (including the appropriateness of their decision making), absent which any sub-optimal performance by said managers may well not be identified.

e. Absent a sufficiently robust system for providing oversight and identifying and significantly mitigating (if not entirely removing) such individual human error, alongside, for example, the inclusion of simple auditable checklists of matters to be accessed, reviewed and documented whenever a referral is received, then there is a continuing risk of urgent future referrals being inappropriately graded as Priority 2 (and/or being downgraded from Priority 1) without the requisite thorough and professional review, adequately documented, being undertaken. This gives rise to a concomitant risk of future deaths.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 March 2025.","Jonathan had been under the care of mental health services for many years and was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, for which he was prescribed medications and was under the community mental health team. He was living in supported housing but decided to seek alternative accommodation, also supported, towards the end of 2023. After this was facilitated, a new placement confirmed and his notice period served, he changed his mind but had to proceed with the move during March 2024. He was unhappy in his new accommodation and only stayed for a short number of days, spending time instead with his mother at her home. There were some gaps in his community mental health care due to staff leave and illness in early 2024, although he was seen during March and April. By 16 April he was not responding to telephone calls. At the time of his death he was not taking any of his prescribed medication. On 24 April 2024 he took his life by going onto the tracks in front of a train at [REDACTED], having sent his mother a text message confirming his intentions.","1. There were communication difficulties experienced by Jonathan’s family and his supported housing with the community mental health trust responsible for his ongoing healthcare during the early part of 2024. Telephone calls and text messages were unanswered and there was no communication to confirm that in fact the care co-ordinator had a period of annual leave followed by an unplanned period of sick leave. It was unclear at inquest if service users and their support network had been provided with details of any service changes and current up to date contact details. This meant that important information was not being received by the community mental health team.

2. The community mental health team actively encouraged communication by text message and emails but had no system in place to intervene when the care co-ordinator was not at work and had left no “out of office” message. There was no system to return or redirect incoming calls or messages so these remained unread and unanswered. Those initiating the communication were unaware that the information was not being received or actioned by the Trust.

3. Jonathan’s case was not “zoned” that is, given a priority coding on the case management system. Therefore, there was no expected period for case review or regularity of expected contact. The multi-disciplinary meetings and supervision meetings when Jonathan’s case was discussed failed to recognise and address this issue. Appropriate zoning and regular reviews are a fundamental part of mental health care and should be embedded and prioritised as part of each patient’s care planning.",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Horstead,Essex,Chief Executive Officer of Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust; Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust,"On 31 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Darren Neil Turner, aged 37 years. The investigation concluded at the end of a 9-day article 2 non-jury inquest on 28 February 2025.","On 23 September 2023 after concerns were raised that Darren, at his home address, was threatening to take his own life having consumed a potential overdose of medication whilst intoxicated with alcohol, the East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST) and Essex Police attended and attempted to facilitate a medical assessment of Darren. He would not consent to such an assessment and EEAST staff, deeming him to have mental capacity, and Essex Police, left him at the property. The following day, whilst apparently experiencing a serious mental health crisis, Darren caused extensive damage, and set fire, to the home he had shared with his former long-term partner, in what was an attempt to end his life. He was arrested and detained under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 1983 and, following an assessment, was subsequently detained under Section 2 of the MHA and admitted as an in-patient to Gosfield Ward, an Acute Psychiatric Unit at the Lakes Mental Health Unit, Colchester, Essex under the care of EPUT on 26 September. Although Darren had no significant previous recorded history of mental health problems, he did have a history of alcohol misuse which had worsened over the two to three years preceding his death whilst working from home as a consequence of the Covid pandemic. A trigger for events in September 2023 appears to have been the ending of his long-term relationship, itself a consequence of Darren’s drinking.

The evidence disclosed multiple significant failings in the care, management and treatment of the deceased up to and including the rescinding of his Section 2 MHA detention and subsequent discharge from Gosfield Ward at around 2 pm on 17 October 2023. These failings, individually and cumulatively, more than minimally contributed to his self-inflicted death by hanging within some 18 hours or so of the rescinding of the Section 2 detention and Darren’s discharge.

Taken together, the causative failures identified during the course of the inquest constituted gross failures and, accordingly, led to a finding that neglect contributed to Darren’s avoidable death.","(a) Failures in care planning: specifically, a failure to appropriately update and document matters relating to Darren’s care plan consistent with Trust policy. The last update to his care plan was 12 days prior to discharge.

(b) Failures in documentation: in a number of acknowledged respects the electronic records were inadequate - and inconsistent with EPUT policy - with evidence of the ‘cutting and pasting’ of entries including Darren’s initial 72-hour care plan containing details of another patient entirely.

(c) Failures in risk assessments: specifically, failures to appropriately update and document matters relating to Darren’s risk assessment consistent with Trust policy. Relevant passive and active risk factors were not formally reflected in his documented risk assessments. Evidence from his responsible consultant psychiatrist and the discharging psychiatrist confirmed that, had they been aware of a disclosure made by Darren to his key worker/nurse prior to discharge, the Section 2 detention would not have been rescinded, he would not have been discharged on 17 October and, accordingly, it is likely that he would not have taken his own life the following day.

(d) Failure to allocate a care coordinator as required under the Care Programme Approach (CPA) and as mandated by EPUT policy. This failure (resulting from significant human error not detected by an insufficiently robust system and not therefore corrected prior to the death - and in respect of which no DATIX was ever raised) was a feature that contributed to the serious failure in discharge planning in this case.

(e) Failures in communication including a failure to appropriately liaise with the deceased’s family and, specifically, Darren’s mother to establish the suitability and safety of a discharge to her address not least in the context of Darren’s disclosure that discharge to his mother’s home might “make him feel worse” at a point in time that he later acknowledged “would be overwhelming” for him.

(f) Failures in discharge planning and execution: specifically, in addition to the features above, a failure to actively reconsider the safety of the discharge on the afternoon of 17 October in light of the disclosure from Darren’s mother that she would not, as had been previously indicated, be able to either collect Darren from the ward or be at her home when he was discharged. There was no evidence of how, in fact, Darren even left the unit. It is likely that the chaotic and unsupported nature of Darren’s discharge from Gosfield Ward, also in breach of Trust policy, more than minimally contributed to his death some 18 hours after discharge.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

Mrs Mann was released from her position, and transported by the Ambulance Service to Bradford Royal Infirmary where she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

Suicide

1a  Asphyxia

1b  Hanging

1c

II","The Deceased hanged himself in his prison cell overnight on 27/28 March 2022. The jury found that this was suicide.

He had spoken to his wife at about 2100 hours on 27 March 2022. She believed he was suicidal and likely to take his life. She, and Cambridgeshire Police and the Metropolitan Police, were all unable to contact the prison by telephone to warn them. It later transpired that this was because the calls were being diverted to an unmanned or obsolete number.

The Deceased's wife drove from Cambridge to the prison, two hours away. She stood outside the main gate for some considerable time, banging on it, calling out and pressing a buzzer which promised to connect her to an intercom through which she could speak to prison staff.

The intercom was out of action and had been for several years. In the result, the Deceased's wife and the police could not contact the prison all night. During that night, the Deceased took his life.","The buzzer/intercom system must have been provided because it was thought important to provide that additional means of communication between the prison and the outside world. In this case, a working system would have enabled the Deceased's wife to warn the prison of his impending suicide.

This could happen again in the future if there was another problem with the telephone system during the night state.

It is difficult to understand why the buzzer/intercom system has not worked for several years. There was evidence that it is irreparable. But the proposed solution appeared to be either to leave it as it is (still not working) or to remove it altogether.

The jury found that the failure to provide a working buzzer/intercom system was a failure.

It is a matter of concern that the prison/the Ministry of Justice still considers that it is unnecessary.",False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

Wood,Kent Mid and Medway,Secretary of State for Health and Social Care; Chief Executive NHS England; Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board,"On 23 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ella Louise Murray who was 13 years old at the time of her death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide plus a narrative ""Ella died as a consequence of hanging herself shortly after being seen by mental health care professionals. She intended to end her life and had told the mental health team she would do so or would harm others so that she would go to prison. There was a failure to undertake an adequate, or any, risk assessment and take any further steps to ensure Ella's safety on 14 November 2024.""","Ella was 13 years old when she died at Kings College Hospital on 15 November 2023 as a consequence of asphyxia due to hanging.

Ella had a history of self-harm and had taken 2 overdoses, the first in December 2022 and the second in August 2023, with a self-inflicted burn in February 2023 requiring treatment at a specialist burns unit. Ella's home life was complicated and she had been involved with social services in the form of Early Help intervention in the autumn/winter 2022/2023 although their involvement ended in February 2023. She had also been referred to school counselling services due to concerns about her mental health with low mood and suicidal ideation and was seen by a counsellor between April and July 2023. Her counsellor was able to provide some support but referrals made to the child and adolescent mental health services were not progressed further. She was seen by the Crisis Team from mental health services after her August overdose but declined further support from them and it was unclear if this was Ella or a combination of Ella and her parents' choice.

A referral had been made by her school to social services in July 2023 when Ella disclosed a sexual assault to a member of staff at the school. Social services did not speak to Ella in July and having spoken to her mother considered that she did not reach their threshold for engagement and the school raised their concerns about this at the time. In the autumn term there were clear signs that Ella was struggling at school and had said she wanted to move schools, a further referral was made to social services in September 2023 and Ella disclosed the name of the person who she said had assaulted her and the member of staff was duty bound to act on this disclosure and involve police. This led to some friction and there were discussions about how to support Ella but some conflict arose between school and home about the best way to deal with this and Ella's behaviour at school, including not attending lessons.

Over the weekend of 10-12 November 2023 Ella had been out with friends and had a sleepover and came back tired and her parents found some messages on her phone which were deemed inappropriate by them. On 13 November 2023 Ella disclosed to a member of staff at school that she wanted to kill herself. The school completed a high risk mental health form for Ella to take with her to hospital and made arrangements for her to be picked up and taken by family to hospital.

Ella was taken to Medway Maritime Hospital by her stepfather and triaged and referred to the Crisis Team at a separate Mental Health Trust and a member of their team came to assess her in the emergency department. She was seen and reported her mood as low but denied intent to end her life but reported ongoing self-harm and suicidal ideation and requested an admission to hospital. She was assessed as being of medium risk of harm and a decision was made to see her at home by other members of the mental health team.

That evening she argued with her parents and ran away from home barefoot and a stranger called the police on her behalf. She told police she was frightened of her stepfather and was worried about returning home. Whilst on the call to police her mum arrived and took her home giving the call handler their address as she left. The police followed up the next morning.

Ella was kept off school the next day and a member of the mental health home treatment team visited in the afternoon. Her documentation shows that she was aware that Ella had run away from home and that she said she would harm herself or others in order to go to prison and was documented as being suicidal and was hearing derogatory voices. The nurse contacted the safeguarding team at 16:02 after she had seen Ella and made a referral to social services.

Ella’s mother was on the telephone after the nurse had visited and went up to Ella’s room where she found her hanging [REDACTED]. She called an ambulance and began cardiac massage on her daughter. The ambulance arrived and the crew continued with resuscitation attempts and a return of spontaneous circulation was obtained. Ella was taken by helicopter to Kings College Hospital and was deeply unconscious on arrival and was admitted to critical care where she died shortly after 14:00 on 15 December 2023.","(1) During the course of the inquest it became clear that Ella was a child in a complex family situation and showing signs of deterioration of her mental health. Her school had raised concerns about her with social services and taken steps to make sure she was seen by healthcare professionals when she indicated to staff at school she wanted to end her life on 13 November 2023. She was assessed by mental health nursing staff and accepted to the caseload of the Intensive Home Treatment Team. She was seen the following day and told the staff nurse who saw her that she was frightened of her stepfather and had run away from home barefoot and police called but she was brought back home by her mother who “grabbed her face” the morning she was seen. She told the nurse that she did not want to be in the family home and would rather go to prison and would harm herself or others if she had to stay at home.

(2) This disclosure led to the nurse making a safeguarding referral but this was made after she left Ella’s home and no urgent steps were taken to remove Ella either to a hospital bed or to ask social services to consider if she should be removed from the family home. Her school had raised concerns about her and she herself had indicated she wished to end her life. Evidence heard at the inquest was that this was the procedure in place and there is no shared access to records for all agencies and no way to convene an urgent multi-agency meeting to determine if Ella was safe to remain at home. Had steps been taken to share information between her school, social services and the mental health providers when she attended the emergency department on 13 November 2023 or early the following day rather than leave her at home she may have been removed from her home and may still be alive today.

(3) Whilst there were concerns about the level of risk assessment undertaken on 14 November 2023 senior staff at the Trust gave evidence that she did not meet the criteria for admission to a hospital bed. This was difficult to reconcile with the documentary evidence as she was clearly crying out for help and her school had recognised this. No one agency involved had access to all the relevant information and concerns about Ella across the health, social care and education arenas. Evidence given suggested that shared records would assist but the ability to respond to urgent concerns would require a system change.

(4) It was brought to the court’s attention that the new Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill includes a duty to share information to promote safeguarding. In addition the local authority may convene a strategy meeting under s47 of the Children Act 1989 although the speed of convening a meeting would depend on availability and would obviously not be as swift as for example attending an accident and emergency department. If a multi-agency meeting had been convened this may have prevented Ella’s death and such action may reduce the risk of death for other children being in a similar position.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 November 2024.

The conclusion of the inquest was that: Harry Southern died on 12 October 2023 at Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. He tied a ligature around his neck the day before which led to hypoxic brain injury. He did so with the intention of ending his life.","Harry Southern had a history of mental illness and involvement from his GP, the Trust’s mental health services and sessions with a private therapist. He had had a traumatic last year of his life which involved the death of relatives, the breakdown of a relationship and the suicide of someone he knew. He had had a previous suicide attempt in 6 2023 and in 10 he left a final note and sadly took his life.","During the course of the Inquest, evidence was provided of the many services available to young men such as Harry who have attempted suicide including services such as the Haven and numbers they can contact if they are suicidal.
However, I am concerned that this information is not in fact provided to people in Harry’s circumstances. Evidence was heard from Harry’s father that indicated that in fact the contact numbers are not answered and do not cater for those with hearing difficulties or other disabilities. Young people in particular are not aware of other services such as Papyrus, a charity that has a round the clock suicide prevention helpline aimed at young people who are suicidal. Younger people with mental health difficulties of course will tend to be more familiar with social media and apps to discuss their problems in addition to just conventional phone numbers.
I am also alarmed at the evidence given at the Inquest that cutbacks and funding issues may result in services to those with mental health difficulties being reduced even further. The Health Secretary will be copied into this Report because I am concerned this may well be a national problem.
The inability of young people in particular with mental health difficulties (and their families) to contact someone at all times who will be able to speak with them (or being made aware that there are agencies who can speak with them) does give rise to a risk of future deaths and action should be taken by the Trust to resolve this.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

The inquest was concluded on 29 November 2024.

The jury concluded that Mr Jefferies died on 5 March 2023 at Frimley Park Hospital, Frimley and the medical cause of his death was:

1a. Hypoxic brain injury and bilateral pneumonia
1b. Suspension

They concluded with a narrative conclusion and found that:

MATERIAL CAUSES

Haydar died as a result of tying a ligature around his neck. It is not possible to determine his intention.

The following are facts that, on the balance of probabilities, have been found to have happened and have made a material contribution to Haydar Jefferies’ death:

Between 18 February 2023 and 1 March 2023, Haydar was suffering from psychosis as referenced by the expert psychiatrist. The fact that Haydar was an IPP prisoner and that his parole hearing was delayed more than minimally contributed to the development of this psychosis, due to the psychological stress.

In February 2023, during Haydar’s detainment at HMP Coldingley, there was a serious failure by the custodial staff to record risk relevant information in regard to his presentation. Specifically, concerns raised by his family through numerous telephone calls and concerning comments made by Haydar to custodial staff. There was an additional failure to ensure that risk relevant information was shared with prison officers and clinical staff.

Between 18 and 27 February 2023, there was a serious failure to refer Haydar to the mental health team. This was despite evidence showing acknowledgement and intent to make a mental health referral on more than one occasion. By 17:30 on 28 February 2023, Haydar was floridly psychotic as evidenced by the expert psychiatrist. The proper response would have been to ensure his immediate safety by putting him on constant supervision and taking him to an external place of safety due to Coldingley’s unsuitable provision of safer cells. That none of this was done represents a serious failure by HMP Coldingley custodial staff.

There was a failure to undertake a substantive mental health assessment on 28 February 2023 following the morning referral from custodial staff and the subsequent CSU review. A mental health review was booked in for the following day which was inadequate.

POSSIBLE CAUSATIVE MATTERS
The following are matters which we have found possibly occurred and more than merely speculatively made a material contribution towards Haydar’s death but we have not found on the balance of probabilities:

Such records as were made were across multiple systems with different levels of access, no set expectation of cross-referencing and reliant on individual initiative and curiosity to be found. The clinical staff at HMP Coldingley were lacking this initiative and curiosity and thereby missed a pattern of behaviour that they could have identified and used to drive better-informed clinical decisions at points such as the brief CSU rounds and reviews.

When the allegation that led to Haydar’s recall was no longer being pursued, there was an opportunity for the Secretary of State to consider an executive release, which was not taken. The IPP parole decision could have been made “on papers” without the need for a meeting, and this too was declined.

The training for custodial staff at HMP Coldingley is inconsistent and inadequate with regard to mental health presentation. The ACCT document and process is unsuitable for a mental health crisis of this kind.

NEGLECT
The death was contributed to by neglect.
This is in relation to a failure to share risk relevant information with clinical staff and procure mental health intervention for Haydar between 18 and 27 February 2023 and a failure to procure medical attention for Haydar after he suffered acute mental health deterioration on the evening of 28 February 2023.

SYSTEM FAILURE
The death was caused or more than minimally contributed to by the failure on the part of the Ministry of Justice to ensure there was a system in place for the recording of the family concerns raised in telephone calls to the prison.

ADMITTED FAILURES
It is admitted that HMP Coldingley ought to have automatically conducted five observations per hour because an ACCT was opened for Mr Jefferies whilst he was on the CSU. It is accepted that only two observations were conducted per hour.","Haydar Jefferies was sentenced to imprisonment for public protection (“IPP”) in 2006. He was released in 2013. Haydar then integrated into the community, married and was working as a publican. Following the death of his spouse and his father in 2021 Haydar attempted suicide. In January 2022 allegations were made against him and he was recalled to prison under the terms of the IPP. By April 2022 the allegations were not being pursued. An Executive Release order request was made and declined. In order to be released from prison Haydar had to attend a parole board hearing. The parole board decided that a hearing in person was required.

In May 2022 Haydar disclosed he had made a ligature. A parole board hearing was fixed on the 13th October 2022. The parole board hearing was vacated owing to the unavailability of the chair person. The next parole hearing was listed for the 2nd March 2023. The extended period of detention was detrimental to Haydar's health and he stated to clinical staff he felt hopeless and helpless after his cancelled parole hearing.

On the 28th December 2022 Haydar was transferred to HMP Coldingley from HMP Bullingdon. Haydar travelled with prisoners who were aware Haydar had come from the vulnerable prisoners wing and made inaccurate assumptions about reasons for being on the wing.

On arrival at HMP Coldingley Haydar’s mental health was reviewed and appeared stable.

On 10th February 2023 the Government rejected IPP resentencing.

On the 12th February 2023 Haydar asked to be segregated for his own safety in the care and separation unit (CSU). This move was supported by a call from Haydar's mother concerned about his safety. On the 14th February Haydar reported low mood and was unwilling to restart previously prescribed medication for depression.

The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) visited Haydar on 15th February 2023 following the Government rejection of the proposed IPP resentencing. Haydar reported that he had lost hope.

From the 18th February 2023 Haydar developed severe depression with psychosis. Haydar's family made several calls to the prison from 18th February 2023 onwards raising concerns about his safety and deteriorating mental health. These calls were not recorded in any prison records.

Haydar made various statements to individual prison staff from 18th February 2023 onwards, which were symptomatic of deteriorating mental health and development of psychosis, including many which were not recorded in any prison records.

A number of statements about Haydar's presentation were recorded across a disparate landscape of on and offline recording systems. On the 19th February custodial staff acknowledged the need to refer Haydar to mental health. This referral was never made despite being recorded as having been completed in prison records.

On the 26th February 2023 custodial staff identified the need to request a mental health review following Haydar's delusional allegations towards staff. Haydar then experienced auditory and visual hallucinations and reported them to his family and custodial staff. This further evidence of psychosis was not recorded. At this time, Haydar was also not taking part in the CSU regime, remaining in his cell at all times.

Prior to the 28th February 2023 neither the information in the family calls nor the concerning statements made to individual prison officers were shared with clinical staff or other prison staff and no referrals were made to the mental health team in relation to Haydar.

On the morning of the 28th February 2023, Haydar told custodial staff he had made peace and was ready for staff to kill him. An email referral, followed up by a phone call, was made to the mental health team for Haydar to be seen as soon as possible on the morning of the 28th February 2023. No mental health assessment was conducted that day.

In the afternoon of the 28th February 2023 Haydar attended a CSU review. During the review Haydar requested a mental health assessment. As part of the review documentation, the CSU algorithm was completed as 'no psychosis'. Evidence provided by an expert witness determined that in fact Haydar was psychotic from 18th February 2023, and on the morning of the 28th had demonstrated red flag behaviour. The CSU review document was not fully completed. The box relating to mental health concerns was left blank.

At around 16.30 on the 28th February 2023 Haydar was observed in his cell, flushing his head down the toilet, naked, on all fours, barking like a dog and he said a female officer had told him to behave like this. At this stage Haydar was floridly psychotic.

An ACCT was opened at 17.30. The ACCT was not fully completed with a justification for Haydar to remain in CSU. No Defensible Decision log was completed. No medical advice was sought and no medical treatment obtained for Haydar on the evening of the 28th February 2023. The medical team were still on site at the time the ACCT was opened. Observations were incorrectly set at 2 per hour and only constant observations would have been sufficient to ensure safety.

Haydar remained on the CSU. This was not appropriate, outside provision should have been sought. During CSU observation, Haydar was found to be slumped over the toilet in his cell. At 2.40 on the 1st March 2023 Haydar was found in cardiac arrest having self-ligatured in his cell. Paramedics attended within minutes and resuscitated Haydar and transported him to Frimley Park Hospital where he was admitted at 04.45 on 1st March 2023.

Haydar had sustained a hypoxic brain injury. Haydar was pronounced dead at 15.11 on the 5th March 2023 at Frimley Park Hospital. His death was caused by hypoxic brain injury and pneumonia.","Evidence was provided by HMP Coldingley and Central North West London NHS Foundation Trust (“CNWL”) in relation to the matters found by the jury. The organisations have taken the matters that led to Haydar’s death seriously.

CNWL are putting in place protocols and training to ensure that staff are better informed before assessing and reviewing prisoners on CSU.

HMP Coldingley are in the process of amending their safer custody policy but to date this has not been produced.

I therefore remain concerned as follows:

In relation to HMP Coldingley:

1. There is no system in place to ensure that information provided in telephone calls in relation to a prisoner’s welfare is recorded.
2. Matters of concern in relation to prisoners are recorded across a number of different records and there is a risk that the information is missed and not disseminated in daily briefing sheets.
3. There is no composite document for clinicians to review to see all relevant information recorded by custodial staff about a CSU prisoner for the proceeding 24 hour period.
4. There is no system in place to check that referrals to the mental health teams requested by senior members of the prison staff have in fact been made.
5. Custody staff are not trained in mental health presentations and are unable to recognise red flag indicators of declining mental health.

In relation to HMP Coldingley and NHS England:

6. Outside of weekday office hours there is no clinical mental health provision. Overnight staffing levels are such that it is difficult for prisoners in mental health crisis to be taken to hospital. As a result:
   a) custodial staff take decisions about how to keep prisoners safe overnight without the necessary clinical knowledge to assess the risks presented by their mental health conditions.
   b) it is not possible for medication to be obtained to alleviate any acute mental health symptoms between 6.30 am and 7 am the following morning.
7. The ACCT process is not designed nor effective to protect prisoners in acute mental health crisis who do not appear to be suicidal.

In relation to the Parole Board:

8. Imprisonment under an IPP is a recognised suicide risk. The delay in dealing with the IPP parole hearing exacerbated the risk. There is currently no process in place to expedite face to face parole hearings for IPP prisoners when allegations leading to their recall have been withdrawn and no criminal action is being considered.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,True

Schofield,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove",Secretary of State for Health; NHS England,"On 23 November 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Zak Sheldrick (Matty). Matty identified as non-binary and preferred the use of the pronouns they and them.

The investigation concluded with the inquest being held over a two-week period which concluded on Friday 13 December 2024.

At the end of the inquest, I concluded that:

On 3 November 2022 at around 02.21 Matty had attended Accident & Emergency at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in crisis following a further deterioration in their mental health. This was the second admission in no less than 5 weeks. During this second admission they were experiencing intense suicidal thoughts.

Later on 4 November 2022 they were formally assessed under the Mental Health Act and the decision taken was not to detain them. Provision was however made for Matty to be able to stay in the hospital that night if they wished.

However, Matty left shortly afterwards and tied a ligature around their neck and suspended themself from [REDACTED]. Their intentions at the time of carrying out this act remain unclear.

The following issues contributed to their death:-
1. The fact that Matty’s private housing accommodation, which had been arranged following their move to Brighton, was not suitable due to their ongoing sensory issues.
2. The fact that there had been no psychiatric bed available to Matty during their first admission to Accident and Emergency Department in September. They stayed in the Accident and Emergency department for 26 days during their admission between 5 and 30 September 2022. This meant that there was no meaningful therapeutic input at that time.
3. The fact that Accident and Emergency Department was not a suitable environment for a neurodivergent individual and the 26-day period of their stay contributed to the deterioration of their mental health difficulties.
4. The fact that there was a general lack of inpatient bed provision for informal patients and in particular for those who are autistic and non-binary who require to be on a mixed ward.
5. The fact that Matty was discharged from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team on 18 October 2022 before being picked up by Assessment and Treatment Service. This left a gap in service provision for Matty.
6. The rigidity of the referral process to Transforming Care in Autism Team (TCAT) meant that Matty was unable to access specialist advice and resources whilst in A&E or in the community.
7. The fact that the mental health assessment carried out during this second admission did not take into account the following:-
- The views and observations of the nearest relative, Matty’s mother.
- Matty’s preferred communication aids and in particular Matty’s communication book.
- The need for Matty to have an advocate present during the assessment and give consideration to the use of idiosyncratic language.
- The extent of Matty’s deteriorating mental state and their increasing risks in the context of their neurodivergence.
- The fact that Matty’s change of behaviour during the assessment may be due to:-
  a) the fact that Matty had been given diazepam
  b) the fact that Matty may have been able to mask their distress.
- Too much emphasis was placed on Matty’s presentation within the assessment itself.
8. There was a lack of discharge care planning documented after the assessment on 4 November 2022 particularly if Matty decided to leave before the morning. This led to confusion within the A&E department when Matty decided to leave the hospital.","Matty had struggled with their mental health throughout their adult life, but it wasn’t until 2019 that Matty was finally diagnosed with Autism, ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorder. However, they had never been sectioned under the Mental Health Act or had spent time as a voluntary patient in a mental health hospital.

Matty had moved to Brighton from Surrey in November 2021 having wanted to live independently. He was drawn to Brighton as they wished to be involved in the trans/non-binary community.

Matty’s mental health deteriorated during the summer of 2022 due to accommodation issues that they had been facing and issues with an online relationship. By 3 September they were in crisis.

On 5 September 2022 Matty was admitted to A&E at the Royal County Hospital, Brighton. They remained within A&E, short stay ward, for 26 days awaiting a psychiatric bed. During this time no bed was found, and they were eventually discharged back home with support from the Crisis Home Treatment Team. Matty’s mental health had been affected by the unsuitability of the environment within A&E for someone awaiting an inpatient mental health bed.

Less than 5 weeks later Matty was again admitted to the A&E department at the Royal Sussex County Hospital on 3 November 2022 in crisis. Their presentation fluctuated and this led to them being assessed under the Mental Health Act. However, they were not found to be detainable. They left the hospital shortly after the assessment and were sadly found hanging in the grounds of the hospital.","1. There is a lack of inpatient beds leading to unacceptable wait times in A&E for those suffering with their mental health who are awaiting beds. In Matty’s case a bed was not found for them within a 26-day period.

2. There being a national shortage of mental health beds in particular for autistic patients and those who are transgender requiring a mixed ward.

3. The unsuitability of the environment of A&E as a holding place for those in need of a mental health bed. The environment in A&E as a holding place is not conducive for those suffering with autism and/or who are neurodiverse. The environment in A&E can exacerbate their mental health.

4. There is a gap in services for those who do not meet the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act but who are too high a risk to be sent home.

5. There is a significant wait time for referral to the Assessment and Treatment Service. Therefore, any therapeutic input is delayed, and this results in repetitive attendances at A&E when in crisis.",True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False

Timothy Robert DE BOOS

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 December 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:

The effects of a self-ignited fire at his home address, whilst suffering a relapse of his known psychotic illness.","Timothy De Boos was declared deceased at his home address in Ipswich, Suffolk on 6 February 2024.

Earlier that day a fire had been seen coming from the ground floor flat of the address.

Tim was seen by a witness to close the window of the flat whilst it was on fire, then disappear from view.

Tim made no attempt to leave, and when found was sat or slumped against the door of the room.

Timothy was known to the mental health services, and had a prolonged history of being mentally unwell (being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2004), with evidence of a previous stated suicidal thought.

A subsequent post-mortem examination identified that Tim had died from smoke inhalation and burns.

Although clearly able to do so Tim made no effort to leave the burning building, and on a balance of probabilities basis, deliberately remained inside with a view to ending his life

Tim had suffered a mental health crisis on 2 February 2024 and Tim himself, Tim’s family, and Tim’s Mental Health Care Coordinator, all believed he should be admitted to a Mental Health Unit at that time as a voluntary patient. This could not be immediately actioned as a referral to another team was required, and members of that team who subsequently saw Tim the following day, deemed he was no longer in a mental health crisis.

If Tim’s admission to hospital had been actioned on 2 February 2024, he could not have been admitted in any event, as there was already a list of five other individuals waiting to be admitted to the same unit.

Had Tim been admitted to a Mental Health Unit on 2 February 2024, his tragic death would not have occurred.","1. I am concerned of the continuing lack of Mental Health Unit inpatient beds in Suffolk, and more widely throughout England and Wales.

At the time of Tim’s mental health crisis on 2 February 2024, had the decision to admit him been possible, he still would not have been admitted as there were five other individuals in the queue before him also waiting for admission.

The lack of available beds is not a new problem, and I have previously issued two Regulation 28 Prevention of Future Death Reports in which a lack of inpatient Mental Health Unit beds have contributed to a death -

Nicola Rayner (died 10 June 2023), reported 7 March 2024.

Piotr Kierzkowski (died 17 December 2019), reported 12 October 2020.

2. In Tim’s case, on 2 February 2024 Tim’s family, Tim himself, and Tim’s Mental Health Care Coordinator (a Senior Mental Health Nurse who had been supporting Tim for a year), all wished for his admission to a Mental Health Unit as a voluntary patient.

It was heard in evidence that a different team (the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team) were the ‘gatekeepers’ for admission and this team could not review Tim until the next day.

When reviewed by Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team staff (who had never met Tim before), they believed his crisis had subsided and his admission was denied.

In evidence Tim’s Mental Health Care Coordinator was adamant that Tim should have been hospitalised on 2 February, as both his family and Tim himself had also wished.

I am therefore concerned that the views of an experienced mental health professional, a patient’s family, and the patient themselves, is deemed insufficient evidence for an admission to a Mental Health Unit as a voluntary inpatient.",True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False

Persaud,London East,"[REDACTED], CEO, North East London Foundation Trust (NELFT)",On 19 March 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dean Martin Ford (aged 40). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 2 December 2024. The conclusion was that Mr Ford died as a result of suicide.,"Mr. Ford suffered a decline in his mental health on 1 March 2024. He was suffering from intrusive thoughts relating to past trauma. His partner was concerned about his mental health and contacted the secondary care crisis team in the very early hours of 2 March 2024. Mr. Ford spoke with the crisis contact. The crisis team did not take a full history or carry out a full risk formulation. Mr. Ford was informed that he would be referred to the community mental health team. The referral was made, but on 4 March 2024 the referral for secondary care mental health services was declined. The reasons for declining the referral were not set out in the records or in the letter to the general practitioner. No further information was sought from Mr. Ford or from his partner before declining the referral. There was no formulation of risk in accordance with the relevant NICE guidelines (issued in September 2022), before declining access to secondary mental health services. It is not possible to determine, on the balance of probabilities, what decisions would have been made by the community mental health team, had a full risk formulation been carried out on 4 March 2024. It is therefore not possible to state on the balance of probabilities that a full risk formulation on 4 March 2024 would have prevented Mr Ford’s death on 10 March 2024. On 6 March 2024, Mr. Ford had a telephone consultation with his GP. He explained that he had experienced suicidal thoughts on 1 March 2024, but stated that he would not act on these thoughts. He described clear protective factors. The GP prescribed anti-depressants and a review appointment was set for 20 March 2024. Crisis information was also provided by the GP. On the evening of 9 March 2024, Mr. Ford had a disagreement with his partner. At around 0850 on 10 March 2024 he left home. At 1035 he is seen on CCTV buying a length of rope. At 1350 he was found hanging in Bedfords Park, Romford. Emergency services were called and paramedics pronounced his life extinct on scene. Police attended and deemed the circumstances as non-suspicious. There were no substances found on toxicology which would have prevented Mr. Ford from forming an intention to take his own life.","(1) Despite clear guidance from NICE in September 2022 relating to the need for a holistic formulation of risk to self, two NELFT teams involved in Mr Ford’s crisis care failed to carry out a holistic formulation of the risk he posed to himself.
(2) A clinical lead for the mental health and wellbeing team within NELFT, gave evidence at the inquest in December 2024 that Mr Ford’s risk was deemed to be low because “the main factor around risk is that he denied any risk to self and denied any suicidal thoughts”. This simplistic assessment of risk is not compliant with the NICE guidelines. It is of concern that a senior member - clinical lead - within the mental health and wellbeing team is not applying the correct risk formulation.
(3) The Trust carries out risk assessment audits for clients who are accepted into the mental health and wellbeing team. There are no audits into the risk assessments for those persons who are referred to the team, but not accepted by the team. As these patients have no safety net of ongoing mental healthcare, it is of concern that the quality of risk assessments for these patients is not audited.",True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

Spencer,East Sussex,The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care; NHS England; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),On 26 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nicolette Elizabeth McCarthy aged 46. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 November 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows:,"Nicolette Elizabeth McCarthy was detained to the Woodlands secure unit under the Mental Health Act Section 5(2) for concerns of her own safety following attempts to take her life.

On 18 and 19 September there remained a risk that she may attempt to end her own life.

On 18 September 2023, Nicolette's family attended the ward round discussion, there is no evidence that confirmation of escorted or unescorted leave was delivered to them. Any ambiguity could have been avoided if Trust procedures had been followed, written confirmation of the S17 decision provided and acknowledged by the family. It was appropriate to grant in principle unescorted S17 leave but not implement it until written confirmation was provided to the family and the risk assessment updated.

Nicolette should not have been required to leave unit grounds. Although the NHS/Sussex Trust have a policy that no smoking should take place within the grounds, there should have been provisions that within secure units secure smoking facilities or indeed an exemption should have been made.

As per the Trust’s ""Record of Patient leave"" form, checks and consideration should have been given to the appropriateness of any items Nicolette had on her person for the leave being taken.

As per the Trust’s concession, the Trust did not take immediate action, aligned to Nicolette’s individual clinical risk, when Nicolette did not return to the ward, following her 15 minutes leave (starting at 14:37) on 19 September 2023. The failure to mark Nicolette as AWOL rather than on leave added to the confusion and highlighted gaps in the record keeping.

Although staffing levels were low and incidents on 19 September 2023 further impacted staff availability, there was a failure to take steps as outlined in Trust policies following identification of Nicolette’s absence.

There were further factors in play: 1) insufficient adherence to recording patient login time in the procedure on the S17 leave sheet. 2) unacceptable delays in taking appropriate action on 19 September. 3) the Trust’s adherence to robust note keeping/updating appears to have been lax and retrospective at times.

It is possible that on 19 September 2023, had staff taken prompt action there would have been opportunities by which Nicolette’s death could have been avoided","1) During the course of the inquest, I heard evidence from clinicians and staff at the Trust to the effect that the NHS England smoke free policy is placing mental health in patients at an increased risk from self-harm and suicide.

2) Although smoking cessation advice and treatment (e.g. gum, vapes etc.) are routinely offered to patients, the evidence was that many struggle to give up smoking on their admission to the ward, in part because the anxiety associated with stopping exacerbates their mental health symptoms. Staff also felt that forcing patients to stop smoking against their will (e.g. by prohibiting them from smoking while on leave) would have a negative effect on their sense of autonomy and wellbeing, which are important for recovery.

3) The Trust understand that they are bound by the Health Act 2006 and by NHS England policy not to permit or facilitate smoking on the ward or anywhere on the grounds of the hospital. This is taken seriously and is interpreted to mean that staff are prohibited from facilitating smoking, for example by granting leave for the purpose of smoking or by escorting patients to smoke outside on short periods of leave. Senior staff also believed that it would be contrary to NHS policy to permit smoking in a secure area, for example the enclosed ward garden. At the same time, it was acknowledged that patients would inevitably seek leave to smoke and that this could not be denied without a negative impact on their mental health.

4) The jury heard evidence that patients, like Mrs McCarthy, were routinely given 15-minute grounds leave for the purpose of smoking, a practice that is discouraged by the Trust. Clinical staff felt that the policy placed them in a difficult position, torn between the need to comply with the smoke free policy, while also supporting patient autonomy and keeping safe those patients who are at a higher risk of self-harm or suicide.

5) There is a further contradiction caused by the smoke free policy, in that patients are not permitted to smoke on the grounds, but are not supposed to leave the grounds during short periods of 'grounds' leave. The result is that patients would spend their 15-minute leave smoking by the side of the road on the edge of the ward grounds, which is a poorly supervised area, and staff would avoid asking them too closely where they were going and would avoid standing close to them, even when smoking themselves. This contributed to the circumstances that allowed Mrs McCarthy to slip away unnoticed and ultimately to take her own life.

6) I also heard evidence from senior staff that the national policy guidance intended to address smoking and s17 leave (e.g. the NICE Guidance and CQC Guidance) does not adequately resolve these contradictions.

7) I am concerned that the NHS smoke free policy, while clearly motivated by a genuine and pressing concern to protect life and promote health, may not be adequately tailored to reflect the safety requirements of mental health wards or the reality that some mental health patients will inevitably seek short periods of leave to smoke. Action may need to be taken at the national policy level to provide clearer guidance and/or review the law to reduce the risk of patients in mental health wards absconding while on unescorted grounds leave.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

Morris,Greater Manchester South,The Department for Work and Pensions,"On 23 February 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of Richard William Brookes, known to his family as Rick. I heard an inquest touching on Rick’s death at Stockport Coroner’s Court on 14 November 2024.","On the 25 January 2024, the deceased accessed the railway by the [REDACTED]. He intentionally stepped in the path of an approaching train and was struck, causing catastrophic and fatal injuries.

In the days prior to his death, the deceased had been experiencing a crisis period in his mental health. He had been diagnosed with possible paranoid schizophrenia in 2011 and was taking anti-psychotic medication. In the days prior to his death he had been expressing paranoid thoughts to his family and was anxious and distressed. His deliberate actions combined with his expressions to his family prior to his death that he thought something would happen that day, led me to conclude that it is likely that he intended to end his own life.","During the inquest, I heard that Rick was a vulnerable adult. He had a diagnosis of possible paranoid schizophrenia and was taking anti-psychotic medication.

Rick was receiving support from the DWP. I heard from [REDACTED] from the DWP that he was in receipt of ESA and DLA until 2016 when his DLA was transferred to PIP. At this point, this should have triggered an additional payment the Severe Disability Payment on his ESA. This didn’t happen and DWP accepted in evidence that this was an error. There was then a delay in rectifying that error. In November 2023 the missed SDP calculation was identified and steps were taken to rectify it. By November 2023 the DWP stated in evidence that they owed Rick over £37,000 in arrears.

[REDACTED] told the inquest that the DWP Guidance for Making Large Payments states that in the case of vulnerable individuals, which Rick had been identified as being, should be dealt with by the CEAST team. [REDACTED] said that the process should have been that Rick was spoken to by an agent who would assess how best to make the repayment in light of any known vulnerabilities he had. However, there is no qualitative record of that conversations beyond a drop down menu on the Severe Disability Journey Management System and “Phone Call Made” being selected as “Yes”. There is no record of the content of that conversation.

On the evidence, I found it is likely that a call did take place. However without the notes, it is not possible to evaluate what was said, how long the call took and what steps were put in place to ensure that Rick understood the information within the call. Without any notes of the call, it is also not possible to assess what Rick was asked about his state of mind, any vulnerabilities he was experiencing and his ability to safely manage the receipt of large payments of money.

The first DWP large payment was made on the 8 December 2023 of £5,000, which was paid directly into Rick’s bank account. Prior to this date, Rick had been receiving benefits to the amount of under £300 per week plus a monthly stipend of money from his family of around £300. This was therefore a significant increase in his income.

It was clear to me from the evidence from Rick’s sister that he became paranoid about the source of that money, indicating to me that any call from the DWP wasn’t understood fully, or that it fed into a period of delusional thinking. The text messages he sent to his sister in the days prior to his death indicate that he didn’t know where the money was coming from.

1. This was a large payment of money to a vulnerable adult who was then required to self-manage that money. In these situations, it is important that there are robust systems in place for ensuring that the requisite assessments and checks are made of an individual to ensure that large payments can be made in a way that does not increase any vulnerability.
2. I heard evidence from [REDACTED] that the DWP systems that are currently in place are hybrid of electronic and clerical systems and that payments can be initiated without there being a full note on the system of the content of the call with the individual.
3. I am therefore concerned that there is no way that an agent, quality assessor or team leader can properly evaluate whether any agreement made between the DWP and an individual regarding repayment has fully considered all the relevant factors regarding their vulnerabilities before a large payment is made.
4. I am also concerned that the DWP currently has no ability to effectively audit its large payments caseload to ascertain whether the failure in record keeping evident in the present case has occurred in other cases.",False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

He was described as being in good spirits. After his parents had gone to bed, it is believed Henry left the address in his father's mother's vehicle and was stopped by the Police and the vehicle was seized by Police at 02:15 hours.

Horstead,Essex,CEO of Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,"On 20 June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jamie Harding, aged 31 years. The investigation concluded at the end of a 5-day inquest on 12 April 2024. The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

I (a) Multiple severe injuries
I (b) Fall from height

II Psychotic disorder

The deceased had been under the care of the Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) Essex Support and Treatment for Early Psychosis (ESTEP) between 2017 and 2020 and he had been prescribed anti-psychotic medication and allocated a care coordinator. The inquest heard evidence that Jamie had engaged relatively well with his care plan and was reporting improvements in his symptoms. However, he began to disengage with services in 2019, which appears to have coincided with the replacement of his care coordinator. He was discharged from EPUT services in November 2020. Jamie’s GP continued to be prescribed anti-psychotic medication.

Two separate and urgent GP referrals were made to EPUT in November 2021 requesting an urgent review of Jamie, as he was hearing voices, experiencing paranoia, and reporting that his medication was not working. His mother also contacted EPUT directly.

On 18 January 2022, Jamie was assessed by EPUT’s First Response Team (FRT) via telephone. Jamie described his symptoms, reported that he was binge drinking, and requested different medication. A plan was put in place for Jamie to self-refer to a drug and alcohol service, and for his case to be discussed in a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting (‘MDT’).

The evidence disclosed that in the six months that followed this assessment there were a series of significant and repeated failures on the part of EPUT employees, together with inadequacies in the systems of operation of EPUT’s First Response Team, in the care, management and treatment provided to Jamie.

My narrative conclusion recorded that the deceased took his own life whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed and, further, recorded that a number of significant and repeated failures contributed to the avoidable death. The cumulative effect of these failures amounted to a gross failure to provide Jamie with basic medical care at a time that his condition clearly required it and, in this respect, neglect directly contributed to Jamie’s death.","On 3 June 2022 Jamie, accompanied by his mother, presented at Basildon Hospital A&E Department in crisis and seeking help for his further deteriorating mental health on a background of some three days lack of sleep and ineffective anti-psychotic medication failing to ameliorate the ongoing and extreme paranoia and psychotic symptoms he was experiencing. In the context of ongoing suicidal ideation and a subjective mood score recorded as 0/10, he was appropriately referred to the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) for assessment by the A&E doctor.

The assessment subsequently undertaken by the MHLT practitioner was inadequate and failed to appropriately act upon relevant information available to him including (but not limited to) information provided by Jamie’s mother regarding her son’s ongoing suicidal ideation and her (and Jamie’s) expressed request for him to be admitted to hospital as a voluntary in-patient as she, and Jamie, did not feel able to keep him safe.

Although the MHLT clinician gave evidence that he had concluded that Jamie required and would benefit from a period of admission as an in-patient, no such admission was sought or planned. Instead, Jamie was discharged home with a plan for him to be seen the following day by the Home Treatment Team. He was provided with a (daily) tablet of Zopiclone for the next seven days. Within hours Jamie had taken his own life having fallen a significant height from a window at his home address.

The failure by the MHLT practitioner to initiate the process for Jamie’s admission to an in-patient bed constituted a clear missed opportunity to ensure appropriate and likely effective steps were taken to mitigate his high risk of acting upon his clear suicidal ideation.

The cumulative effect of the series of serious failures in the six months preceding the events of 3 June amounted to a gross failure to provide Jamie with basic medical care at a time that his condition clearly required it. In this respect, neglect directly and more than minimally contributed to Jamie’s death.","(a) The accepted absence of effective formal, compulsory training for clinicians regarding the Dual Diagnosis (DD) pathway and what it does and does not provide, how to access it and the potential benefits of it. The evidence confirmed that practitioners outside of the DD workers/pathway were unaware how they could contact them, including directly.

(b) In addition to weak record keeping and poor communication with patients and their families, the evidence revealed the lack of a robust and reliable system to ensure that the FRT deals with its caseload efficiently and effectively and particularly how it flags and then follows up referrals to and queries from other services/clinicians contributing, in turn and on the facts of this case, to the significant failure to hold an MDT. The FRT did not follow up (as it was accepted it should have) the referral (via a self-referral) to Open Road or the referrals for a medication review. Had there been such follow up, EPUT evidence confirmed that there would likely have been a discussion of Jamie’s case at a full MDT with the likely allocation of a Care Coordinator, the likely involvement of the Dual Diagnosis pathway and the likely use of the RAG rating system to ensure on-going risk assessment.

In my opinion these features give rise to a clear risk of future deaths and must be addressed.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,True

1c

II Coronary heart disease",,"(1) During the inquest evidence was heard about the use of Detention services order 09/2016 Detention centre rule 35 (2)

The purpose of rule 35 of the Detention Centre Rules 2001, as set out in Detention - general guidance (chapter 55), is ‘to ensure that particularly vulnerable detainees are brought to the attention of those with direct responsibility for authorising, maintaining and reviewing detention.

Rule 35 (2) states

2. ‘The medical practitioner shall report to the manager on the case of any detained person he suspects of having suicidal intentions, and the detained person shall be placed under special observation for so long as those suspicions remain, and a record of his treatment and condition shall be kept throughout that time in a manner to be determined by the Secretary of State.

‘The manager shall send a copy of any report under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) to the Secretary of State without delay.

Despite Frank Ospina being witnessed as having made an attempt to take his life, and self-reporting a further attempt during his detention, no R35 report was made.

The GP evidence was that there was a long waiting list of 4 weeks of over 100 individuals who were dealt with in separate dedicated surgeries, that he had only made ""a small number"" of R35 (2) reports and that he would usually await and rely on additional evidence such as that from a Consultant Psychiatrist before submitting a R35 (2) report. In contrast, the Home Office evidence was that they were ""surprised"" that a R35 report had not been submitted. If it had been it would have been considered by a responsible officer within 2 working days.

There was a clear mismatch between the healthcare and Home Office expectations and practical application of the R35 provisions. HMC was advised that this is under review currently by the Home Office and NHS England and so this report is written to inform and assist that review process by raising the concerns from this inquiry. HMC would also question the restriction of the report having to be generated by a general practitioner, although detainees were seen by a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals, many of whom could potentially carry out this task.

(2) Visits. The inquest was advised that Frank Ospina's mother visited him in the Heathrow Immigration Removal Centre on one occasion, and that was conducted as a ""closed"" visit.

Her son was accompanied by 2 Officers and their meeting held behind a glass screen where no physical contact was possible. The Officers were overhearing the family conversation and making notes.

MITIE who are responsible for the day to day running of the IRC were unaware that a ""closed"" visit had occurred and apologised for this, confirming it was inappropriate and Frank Ospina and his mother should have been allowed to meet in the usual communal area where they could have embraced and had a private conversation. This was the last time Frank Ospina was seen alive by his mother and the visit greatly distressed her.

HMC is concerned that any ""closed"" visits could take place seemingly without the knowledge and consent of the Duty Manager, that no documentation had to be presented and the ""closed visit"" room was accessible even though rarely required (the inquest was advised it had not been used at all during the past few months).

(3) Frank's mother does not speak English and found it very difficult to arrange a visit. In fact rather than successfully navigate the system, she just turned up and was permitted to see her son as set out above. Telephone calls were not facilitated with an interpreter. The web site where visits should be booked is entirely and only in English. This is a facility that by definition detains foreign nationals and predictably some of the family members do not speak English. A quick check of the local authority website (Hammersmith and Fulham) revealed a full immediate translation facility into over 100 languages, and so this is readily available technology. The Home Office and MITIE should consider the communications currently available to relatives trying to visit their loved ones and whether these can be improved by reasonable adjustments.",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

The conclusion of the inquest was ‘John Paul Hurst had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia with a long history of mental health difficulties and was the main carer for his father. Having initially been arrested in connection with the death of his father and subsequently de-arrested and then re-arrested on suspicion of an offence of possession of a controlled substance he was released from custody under investigation and then died [REDACTED] on 15 September 2021 from the effects of bleeding from trauma consistent with the amputation of the lower half of his right leg which is consistent with impact with a passing train in circumstances which cannot be explained.’

The medical cause of death was: -
Ia right lower limb injury","John Paul Hurst had a medical history of a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He had previously attempted to take his own life on three occasions between 2000 and 2002, and had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act during the same period.

John lived with his father and was his main carer. His father sadly passed away on 12 September 2021. Due to concerns around the length of time before John had sought assistance from emergency services, his demeanour upon police arrival and notes containing disturbing content within the premises, John was initially arrested on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter. He was quickly de-arrested for that offence and re-arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance.

Concerns were raised by police officers involved in the investigation about his mental health due to John’s demeanour, the volume and content of the notes found at the scene and detailed concerns expressed by his sister regarding a risk of him ending his own life upon release.

John was assessed by Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service (CJLD) and deemed fit for interview and release from custody.

Following his interview, John was released from custody at around 4pm on 13 September 2021. He last spoke to his sister at around 9.44pm on 13 September 2021.

On the afternoon of 15 September 2021, John was found by a passer-by in undergrowth near to the train tracks [REDACTED]. John died due to the effects of haemorrhage from the tearing and loss of the lower half of his right leg consistent with impact with a train moving at high speed.","At the Inquest I heard evidence that, following John’s arrest, concerns were expressed by police officers involved in the investigation as to his mental health, and by John’s sister as to his risk of ending his own life. These concerns were repeated by John’s sister to the Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service (CJLD) prior to his assessment. The evidence was that when completing the release risk assessment, the custody sergeant had been greatly assisted by the information recorded on the electronic custody record regarding the concerns that led to the mental health assessment and the assessment itself, in addition to the custody sergeant’s own observations. The evidence highlighted that the electronic custody record contained limited information about the concerns of police officers and John’s sister, and there was a distinct lack of detail about the assessment itself and very little analysis of the concerns and reasoning for the CJLD conclusion.

I am concerned that the information on the electronic custody record was inadequate and lacked detail regarding the concerns for the detained person’s mental health, as identified by police officers and family, including the risk of suicide, the content of notes found and the detained person’s history of suicidal ideation and previous engagement with mental health services. In addition, I am concerned that the record also lacked a detailed analysis of those concerns by CJLD and comprehensive reasoning for the assessment conclusion.

On 11 March 2024 Nigel fell from [REDACTED] at his home address.

An ambulance was called, and Nigel was initially taken to the Ipswich Hospital but was transferred to the trauma centre at Addenbrooke’s Hospital due to the extent of his injuries.

Nigel succumbed to the injuries received in the fall, three days later.

Nigel had suffered with his mental health for a protracted period, and it is more likely than not that his fall from the window was a deliberate attempt to end his life.","1. In late 2018 Nigel became seriously mentally unwell and was admitted to a Mental Health Unit, under the Mental Health Act provisions, for a period of 3 months. Whilst admitted, Nigel was diagnosed with advanced lymphoma (a lymphatic cancer) and upon discharge from the Mental Health Unit spent a further 3 months in hospital being treated for this.

2. Nigel found his Mental Health Unit admission very traumatic and was described as ‘terrified’ of the thought of ever being admitted again.

3. Upon his release, his family, carers, Mental Health Home Treatment team, worked together to provide exemplary care for Nigel, whose health stabilised and in 2020 his care was transferred back to his own General Practitioner.

4. Nigel remained well until Friday 8 March 2024, when due to his decline in mental health he was taken to see his GP, and on 9 March 2024 Nigel was prevented by family intervention from ending his life by

5. This incident led to Nigel’s family speaking to the on duty Authorised Mental Health Professional (AMHP) from the Suffolk Emergency Duty Service Team, on the evening of 9 March 2024. An AMHP is a mental health professional approved by a local social services authority to coordinate the mental health assessment and admission to hospital, of individuals requiring admission under the Mental Health Act provisions

6. In evidence, the court heard that the AMHP, in line with Nigel’s family and his own wishes, agreed that an admission to hospital would not be in Nigel’s best interest. The AMHP identified that the successful home treatment regime previously in place would be the ideal care package for Nigel. This arrangement would also be consistent with the ‘least restrictive principle’ which surrounds the application of Mental Health legislation.

7. That said, although Nigel did not meet the criteria for immediate admission, the AMHP believed Nigel was mentally very unwell, and in need of immediate support. The court heard that such support would be available within a 4-hour target time, from the emergency Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team.

8. However, the court was told that an AMHP, despite their role in the coordination of the mental health assessment and admission to hospital of a patient, were not permitted to make direct referrals to the emergency Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team.

9. The court heard that the normal route for such referrals was via the GP Surgery, or primary care Mental Health Nurse, neither of whom in Nigel’s case would have been available before 08:00 on Monday 11 March 2024. Nigel’s fall which led to his death, occurred at 06:25 that morning.

10. I am concerned, as had the AMHP in Nigel’s case been able to directly refer him to the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team on 9 March 2024, mental health professionals would have attended, and been able to provide additional support, advice and potentially additional treatment for Nigel, in all likelihood preventing his death.",False,True,True,True,False,False,True,False

II","Carol Ann Guest resided at home with her partner and did not have a history of mental health problems until 2024. These appear to have been triggered by her mother (for whom she had been caring for for a considerable period of time) being admitted to a care home. There were references in the GP notes to Ms Guest and her family seeking help and support in relation to mental health difficulties, which the family felt were escalating. On 8 March 2024 a family member contacted the GP expressing concerns regarding escalation of symptoms and Ms Guest having taken excess medication the previous week. The GP did not feel a telephone call that day was indicated but did feel that urgent referral was necessary but regrettably the urgent referral was not sent until a week later. Once received by yourselves on Friday 15 March, Mrs Guest's referral was placed on the SPA meeting list for the following Thursday (20 March) where it was discussed and determined that she would not follow the usual pathway and wait for a routine appointment but that a consultant would visit her [REDACTED] the following week. Before that visit could be arranged Ms Guest hanged herself [REDACTED] at her home address on 24 March 2024.","During the course of the evidence from both family and medical witnesses it became clear that there were no adequate systems in place for providing crisis support to patients over the age of 65. The family were very concerned and very frustrated by the futile attempts they made to secure psychiatric input and support when they could see a rapidly deteriorating picture. There was no explanation as to why individuals in crisis who were 65 or under had access to the crisis service but once a person is over 65 that service is no longer available to them. It is not clear whether access to such services would have altered the outcome but the current structure and services available in my view denied Ms Guest with the opportunity of obtaining specialist assessment support at a much earlier stage. A further concern was that the GP surgery provides patients with the crisis number seemingly without appreciating that this would only be available to those who were 65 or under. Furthermore, the family's evidence was that when they called 101 seeking medical input and support for Ms Guest, they were told they would be referred to the crisis team but as soon as Ms Guest's age was mentioned they halted that process and said that they would not be able to refer her after all because of her age.",False,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

The deceased attended an appointment at St George’s Park Hospital on 12 February 2022.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 August 2024.

On 25 December 2020 Ms Nalubowa suspended herself with a ligature, whilst an inpatient at the St Pancras Hospital in King’s Cross. She was successfully resuscitated but sustained a hypoxic brain injury from which she subsequently died.","Immediately prior to her detention the Deceased had been living in Stockton in the North of England (near Middlesbrough).

However she was now divorced with few ties to that area.

Moreover, importantly, concerns had been raised that the ex-partner in question was abusive.

The Deceased’s family and support network was in London and not Stockton.

Returning to Stockton was a source of great anxiety for the Deceased. She commented that she would “rather die than return to Middlesbrough [sic]”.

It was clear to treating clinicians that securing the right accommodation was paramount to her mental health prognosis and to her future more generally.

It was clear to treating clinicians that surrounding the Deceased with a positive supportive network of family was crucial in maintaining mental health.

Despite all of the above, the existing framework/rules were such that all London boroughs, correctly applying the relevant criteria, rejected the Deceased’s applications for accommodation in London.

The witness evidence was clear that there was no “discretion” and that London Boroughs and treating clinicians alike were powerless. The Deceased was therefore discharged to Stockton, against her wishes, against medical advice, away from her support network, and to an area where she would have to at best face her demons and at worst be in physical danger.

Shortly after being told she was being discharged to Stockton, the Deceased suspended herself using a ligature.","Please see Box 4, above.

The evidence at the inquest was that this situation is not uncommon, with those detained under the MHA not infrequently having social circumstances such that their historical place of residency is, for whatever reason, deeply inappropriate (or even dangerous).

It should be noted that section 117 Mental Health Act 1983 did not apply.

I am concerned that the rigidity and lack of flexibility in the criteria, coupled with the evidence this is a not uncommon phenomenon, gives rise to a risk of future deaths in cases which do not meet the threshold for aftercare under s.117.

Consideration should be given to giving decision makers greater latitude / discretion or the power to apply common sense, in circumstances where (a) it is foreseeable that rigid adherence to criteria will lead to personal injury (including psychiatric injury) and/or serious emotional harm (b) there is an obvious alternative solution, such as accommodation near family.",False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False

The investigation concluded on 26 April 2024. The conclusion of the jury in the inquest was:

Suicide. Matthew’s death was probably the result of systemic failures across multiple agencies including the Prison services. A contributing factor to these failures may have been Covid. There was inadequate communication between agencies and a lack of information sharing. This probably led to a failure to identify his deteriorating mental health and increasing suicide risk. This is evidenced by repeated failures to open ACCTs post February. Despite concerns raised by a highly engaged, caring and supportive family, it is probable insufficient weight was given to their attempts to raise the alarm.","Matthew died on 16 August 2021 at HMP Wormwood Scrubs, Du Cane Road, Hammersmith. Matthew was remanded in custody in January 2021. It was his first time in prison. He was on an ACCT in early February 2021 but not thereafter. He was referred to be seen by a counselling service. His first-born child was born on 27 July 2021. The birth of a child is not listed a risk factor in PSI 64/2011. He was awaiting sentencing. He was seen by a nurse in prison on 31 July 2021 with cut wrists. His family repeatedly raised concerns about his mental health. He was first assessed by the counselling service on 2 August 2021, declined counselling on 11 August 2021 and was consequently discharged from that service. No action was taken by the prison when repeated concerns were raised by his family on Saturday 14 August 2021. He was last seen alive on Sunday 15 August 2021. He was found in his cell on 16 August 2021 after he had tied [REDACTED] around his neck and tied his wrists and ankles to the bed. He died due to asphyxia. At the time that he did the act that caused his death, he probably did so with the intention of ending his life. On the balance of probabilities, there were numerous failings by the prison service that cumulatively contributed to Matthew’s death, including: a failure to record and keep complete records on NOMIS or otherwise; a failure to communicate between colleagues and shifts; and a failure to follow up closure of his ACCT and resignation of wing cleaner role. It was unacceptable that multiple opportunities, that would constitute opening an ACCT, were missed (April, July, August 2021). The prison failed to act on repeated serious concerns raised by Matthew’s family on Saturday 14 August through the Safer Custody Helpline. It is possible that multiple opportunities were missed to identify concerns with Matthew’s mental health due to the Key Worker System not being fully implemented throughout HMP Wormwood Scrubs. Covid may have been a significant contributor to some of these failings due to increased work pressures and regime changes. On the balance of probabilities, the implementation of the policy in relation to the opening of ACCTs was inadequate. It was noted by a Supervising Officer that there was an implied pressure not to open an ACCT due to associated workload pressures. Post closure period processes for ACCTs were not adhered to after Matthew arrived in E wing. If these were effectively followed, then risks could have been more readily identified. This failure probably contributed to Matthew’s death. Post Matthew’s arrival to E wing, there were numerous red flags over an extended period across all services (e.g. prison services, PPG, secondary mental healthcare, Forward Trust and Atrium) that should have resulted in an ACCT being opened – failure to do so probably contributed to Matthew’s death. On the balance of probabilities, Matthew’s risk of suicide was not adequately identified. Post move to E wing and closure of the ACCT, there were numerous failures to identify suicide risks. Not enough weight was given to known risk factors such as the birth of Matthew’s daughter, approaching court dates, first time in prison and feelings of guilt, shame and paranoia. These were not given due credence in comparison to Matthew’s assurances that he was not suicidal. As Matthew’s mental health deteriorated towards the end of July, a series of escalating risk indicators arose. Family concerns were raised to Safer Custody and escalated to the Supervising Officer and secondary mental health services. No action was taken by the prison when repeated concerns were raised by his family on Saturday 14 August. These inadequacies in the identification of suicide risk cumulatively probably contributed to Matthew’s death. The Court heard evidence that prisoners were locked in their cells for up to 23 hours a day, with a negative effect on their mental health. The Court heard evidence that one of the ways that prisoners could leave their cells is to attend gym, but that there is a shortage of gym instructors due to the manner of training of gym instructors which entails potential trainees having to attend training at a distant location for significant period of times rather than locally as well as the length of the course, both of which serve as significant disincentives for staff to be trained as gym instructors.","1. The birth of a child is not recognised as a specific risk factor in PSI 64/2011 which means that staff may underestimate its significance on mental health.

2. The robustness of the process for ensuring that the ACCT post-closure process is followed, particularly following a move to another location.

3. Training of staff in the ACCT process.

4. Prisoners being kept in their cells for up to 23 hours a day, with a negative effect on their mental health.

Bennett,Birmingham and Solihull,"Chief Executive, Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust",On 2 January 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kieran Lavin. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held between 22-25 July 2024.,"Kieran had experienced anxiety and depressive symptoms for around 10 years with worsening symptoms in late 2023. In November he consulted his GP having inadvertently stopped taking his anti-depressant medication. On 5 December he reported worsening symptoms after restarting his medication for two weeks, and said he had thoughts of jumping in front of a vehicle and an overdose, citing the breakdown of his relationship with his wife as one of the triggers. He was referred to the Crisis team and assessed on 7 December reporting no active suicidal plans. His anti-depressant medication was increased, and he agreed to be seen routinely in 4 months. The following day, on 8 December he booked into a hotel to overdose on his medication with alcohol. He was surprised to wake up and was admitted to the Emergency Department early on 9 December. Psychiatry & Liaison referred him to the Psychiatric Decisions Unit (‘PDU’) for further assessment as he could not guarantee his safety. He arrived at the Oleaster Centre, Birmingham at 9:55pm. The following day, early morning on 10 December during a nurse assessment he said he was angry the overdose attempt had not worked, and if he went home, he would maybe throw himself in front of a lorry. He cited in part the relationship breakdown with his wife as one of the triggers for his presentation. Later that day, he was assessed by a consultant psychiatrist whose impression was of a depressive episode, and that Kieran required informal admission as he did not feel safe to go home, which Kieran agreed with. The following day, by 11am on 11 December Kieran proactively contacted a second nurse reporting when outside the unit for a cigarette he had terrible thoughts, and he does not feel safe going outside because he thinks he needs to kill himself and he will run and jump in front of a car or train. Around 1-2pm he was assessed by a junior Dr and reported no active suicidal plans, but her impression was he was very anxious and depressed, and the plan was maintained. The long wait for a bed was due to the mental health service having no available inpatient bed. A private mental health service agreed to admit him in Willenhall. Kieran’s wife had arrived to drop off some clothes and Kieran asked if his wife could drive him. The bed manager, also nurse in charge of the Oleaster Centre, had intended that Kieran be transported via taxi accompanied by a member of staff, but agreed to his wife driving him on the basis Kieran was a voluntary inpatient, wanted treatment, and assessed his presentation on and off the PDU as raising no safety concerns. He did not record his risk formulation. He was not aware of the two reports of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision. Had he looked at the ‘level 1 risk screening’ neither nurse had at this stage updated the ‘suicide’ box. No record of his suicidal ideation on 10 December was ever added, and the suicidal ideation reported on the morning 11 December was not added until 8:51pm and after the incident had occurred. Whether his wife’s presence would exacerbate Kieran’s presentation was not fully considered, or the length and nature of the journey. His wife was not informed of Kieran’s reported suicidal ideation. The mental health service’s policies, procedures and guidelines did not set out a clear approach to assist regarding what should happen when a patient requests for family to transfer them to another location for an informal admission. Kieran left with his wife in her car around 7:45pm. Shortly after 8pm, having just spoken on the phone to his mum, he suddenly proceeded to open the passenger door whilst in lane 1 of the M5 motorway. His wife attempted to physically stop him whilst managing to move to the hard-shoulder whereby Kieran exited the passenger door and walked around the rear of the car into the path of an oncoming large lorry in lane 1, and thereafter was struck by a second car. He was confirmed deceased at the scene from the consequential injuries (1a. Multiple injuries).

The inquest conclusion was: “Suicide, contributed to by a failure to conduct an adequate patient transport risk assessment which would have likely changed the outcome.”","1. Critical suicide risk information was not recorded at all or not recorded in a timely manner. On 10/12/23, the experienced nurse did not record at all in the ‘suicide’ box on the ‘level 1 – risk screening’ the first report of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision. She described this omission as an error and the likely explanation was that she was the only nurse working on a very busy shift. On 11/12/23, the experienced nurse did not in a timely manner record in the ‘suicide’ box on the ‘level 1 – risk screening’ the second report of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision received by 11am. She said the likely explanation for not updating the ‘suicide’ box until 8:51pm (and after the nurse-in-charge made his transport risk formulation) was that she was the only nurse working on a very busy shift. The experienced nurse-in-charge did not record at all his transport risk formulation saying that was not his usual practice. The Patient Safety Manager said long standing trust policy required clinicians to record key information as soon as possible. I am not persuaded this long standing policy is sufficient by itself to remove the risk in the future of critical suicide risk information not being recorded at all or in a timely manner given three experienced nurses within 24 hours failed to follow the policy.

2. Post-death trust learning led to new guidance for when an informal patient requests family, carer, or friend transport them from PDU. For ease of reference it states:

“Where appropriate, it is reasonable for the option of an informal patient to be transported by family/carer/friends. In all such cases, decision needs to be based on the risk/benefit ratio and this also needs to be clearly discussed with the person transporting to make sure there is understanding and agreement. This needs to be clearly documented within the patient’s notes. If there is any concern or disagreement expressed by the person, family/carer/friends, then alternative arrangements need to be made by us.”

I am not persuaded this is sufficient to remove the risk of an inadequate risk assessment in the future. By way of contrast, trust guidance C52 ‘Mental Health Act Transport of Patients’ - which applies when a patient has been assessed under the Act and ambulance service transport is to be used - at paragraph 12 includes 15 specific questions that the risk assessor should ask as part of the transport risk formulation, including: How far does the patient have to travel? What is the patient’s age and gender? What is their current state of mind? Is there a risk to the driver/accompanying individuals? The updated guidance cited above is absent any equivalent specific questions or assistance on when it is or is not appropriate. For example, in Kieran’s case clinicians were aware his sex, age, and background of relationship breakdown statistically recognised him as being at a higher risk of suicide, PDU is only intended for a brief stay whereas Kieran was there for nearly 48 hours and his state of mind was not assessed in the hours before the risk formulation (even though it was known to fluctuate), the journey if considered would have been noted to take him away from local roads onto a high speed motorway, and his wife/the driver was known to be a trigger for his low mood. Further, there was no consideration of what his wife had to be told to ensure she was safe, providing genuine informed consent given the interplay of patient confidentiality. In Kieran’s case the transport risk formulation did not consider whether his risk of suicide included road traffic collision vs an unrelated mechanism. My concern is the above cited guidance in simply stating the decision should be based on ‘appropriateness’ and ‘the risk/benefit ratio’ does not sufficiently prompt clinicians to consider the full range of key issues and is inconsistent with the more expansive guidance in C52 for when an ambulance is to be used.

For completeness, (1) there was discussion during the inquest about why there cannot be a blanket ban on informal patients with recent suicidal ideation via road traffic collision being transported by family etc given they represent a very small cohort of patients. If no such ban is considered appropriate, in my view, the need for more expansive and specific guidance for clinicians equivalent to C52 is increased, and (2) there was discussion at the inquest of a transport risk formulation based on a points system with a written draft suggestion from the Family’s counsel; I attach a copy which may be of assistance for the trust when deciding what if any action to take.",False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, before a jury, on 17 May 2024.

The medical cause of death was:

Ia Ligature suspension

The conclusion of the inquest was “Frazer Charlie Williams died by suicide in circumstances where there was inadequate assessment and monitoring of his risks of self-harm and suicide prior to his death”.","Frazer was found deceased on 7 March 2022, in his cell at HMP Guys Marsh, Shaftesbury, Dorset, suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. On 4 June 2021 Frazer was placed at HMP Lewes where he remained until his release on 4 October 2021 having served a sentence of imprisonment. On 7 October 2021, he was remanded into custody and placed at HMP Winchester. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on 10 November 2021 and was due to be released on 25 March 2022.

ii. During his placement at HMP Lewes, Frazer presented with a deterioration in his mental health and remained subject to an ACCT due to an incident of self-harm, and was also under the care of the healthcare team until the point of his release on 4 October.

iii. Following his arrival at HMP Winchester, which has a residential healthcare unit, referrals were made to the mental health team. Frazer was assessed by a psychiatrist on 20 December 2021 who felt that he was suffering with enduring psychotic illness and required further review.

iv. On 14 January 2022 Frazer was transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. HMP Guys Marsh does not have a healthcare unit or a 24 hour in-prison healthcare provision. The healthcare team operating hours are 7.30am to 6pm daily.

v. An email was sent from the healthcare team at HMP Winchester to the healthcare team at HMP Guys Marsh with Frazer’s name and that he was a person of interest. No other handover took place between the healthcare teams or the prison staff teams.

vi. Following Frazer’s transfer, the Head of Healthcare at HMP Guys Marsh raised an inappropriate transfer investigation as the clinical opinion was that he should not have been transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. Prior to Frazer’s transfer, there had not been a discussion with the healthcare teams at HMP Winchester and Guys Marsh by the prison service to consider suitability of Frazer’s transfer in view of the fact he was in the process of being assessed, and a confirmed diagnosis being made, relating to his mental health.

vii. The Associate Medical Director for Practice Plus Group (PPG) who provided the healthcare at HMP Lewes and HMP Guys Marsh when Frazer was at those establishments, confirmed that there is no national directory that explains what healthcare facilities are available at each prison and PPG have created one internally for the prisons they provide healthcare at. It was explained that this would assist when making decisions around suitability of location within the prison estate for prisoners, given their needs. Further, if there was a national directory across all prisons this would greatly assist as PPG are only 1 of the 10 different healthcare providers across 114 prisons. He gave an example that he would not know how many disability access beds or cells there are at the prisons where PPG do not provide the healthcare. He also explained that there is no national specification in relation to healthcare units.

viii. Frazer was a person with complex needs. His mental health deteriorated at HMP Guys Marsh. He would spend most of the time in his cell, he generally did not engage with staff or ACCT reviews, and there were records that he missed and secreted medication. He held delusional beliefs that if his toilet was flushed or he watched television, his family would come to harm. His cell was in an extremely poor state, littered with rubbish, an unflushed toilet and a bucket which was used for him to urinate and defecate in. This bucket was found to be full in his cell at the time of his death. It was acknowledged by the staff at the time he was self-neglecting and he was referred to the Safety Intervention Meeting (SIM) process on 9 February 2022. The Head of Healthcare gave evidence that there was not an adequate plan between the prison and healthcare teams to manage Frazer’s self-neglect.

ix. There is no national guidance on how to manage self-neglect in prison. HMPPS are currently finalising a Social Care Learning Brief on Managing Self Neglect which is expected to be issued later this year, however there is no NHS guidance on this issue or joint guidance between HMPPS and NHS as to how to manage self-neglect in a prison setting.

x. Frazer’s mental health deteriorated to such an extent that following an assessment on 9 February 2022, he was deemed to require transfer to hospital under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The second doctor assessment was carried out the following day, 10 February 2022, and an application was sent to Ravenswood House Hospital, a secure unit within Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust on 15 February 2022. Frazer was visited by the community psychiatrist on 25 February 2022 when it was confirmed he required transfer to hospital for full assessment and treatment. The warrant was obtained from the Ministry of Justice for the transfer on 1 March 2022. A bed was offered to HMP Guys Marsh by the hospital on 1 March 2022 for admission on 3 March 2022, however, the prison could not facilitate an escort that day. The hospital could not facilitate safe admission on Friday 4 March 2022 or over the weekend, and the transfer was arranged for Monday 7 March 2022. Frazer was told on 3 March 2022 he would be transferred to hospital, however the evidence indicated he was not told when. At approximately 03:15am on 7 March 2022 Frazer was found deceased in his cell, suspended by a ligature.

xi. The ligature was made from a ripped bedsheet attached to the top corner of the cell door. The bedsheet was the same colour as the door and had not been seen prior to his death, and was therefore camouflaged. I refer to the attached photograph of the cell door which shows the ligature in place. The colour of the cell doors in each prison is directed by the Governor of the prison and not by national directive, however the same bedsheets are issued nationally across the prison estate. The similarity in colour could be a national issue and apply to other prisons.

xii. An ACCT was opened in relation to Frazer on 15 January 2022 and remained open until his death. Between 15 January and 7 March 2022 there were 11 case reviews. The ACCT records were incomplete and inadequate. The last case review took place on 1 March 2022. The next case review was scheduled for 3 March 2022, however this did not take place and there was no further case review prior to Frazer’s death. The evidence did not reveal why this had not taken place. As the ACCT is a paper-based system, a missed case review is not automatically flagged in any way.

xiii. Since Frazer’s death there has been the implementation of the ACCT assurance process nationally which requires the ACCT paperwork to be reviewed on 3 occasions as quality assurance or audit. Firstly, between 25 and 72 hours of the ACCT being opened, secondly at day 7 of the ACCT being opened and finally at the post-closure review. If a person is subject to an ACCT for a lengthy period of time, there is a gap between day 7 and the post-closure review where no quality assurance is required to be undertaken.

xiv. Frazer’s key worker at HMP Guys Marsh gave evidence that in an ideal world prison officers would sit down with a prisoner for 45 minutes once a week to undertake key work as per national guidance. He explained that the 2 key work sessions he had with Frazer lasted no more than 5 minutes and were conducted on the landing outside his cell whilst other people would be walking around the wing. This was due to the fact the officer had to run the wing at the same time and he therefore explained the keywork sessions were not effective. He confirmed that the keywork sessions he undertakes now with prisoners now would probably be no more than 15 minutes. He further confirmed he was not invited to any of Frazer’s 11 ACCT case reviews and to date he has never been invited to any ACCT reviews for any prisoner at HMP Guys Marsh, even as a prisoner’s keyworker.

xv. There is inequity in the system in that if a person is deemed detainable under the Mental Health Act 1983 in the community, they will be admitted to hospital straight away. If there is no bed available in a psychiatric unit they will be placed in an acute hospital where there is monitoring and access to medical care 24 hours a day. If a person is in need of hospital care and treatment under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983, there are delays in the transfer to a hospital setting. When a prisoner suffers a physical health problem they can be transferred to hospital for care by ambulance or escort. With a mental health care problem, the appropriate paperwork needs to be completed, a hospital bed found and arrangements made for transfer before a person is admitted to hospital. During this time a prisoner may be placed, as Frazer was, in a prison without a healthcare unit and without 24 hour healthcare monitoring and care. The current legal timeframe for this is within 28 days. In relation to Frazer, his transfer would have been completed 26 days after he was first assessed. Several witnesses said this was one of the quickest transfers they had experienced.

xvi. When a code blue or code red is called at HMP Guys Marsh, evidence was given that the control room do not automatically call an ambulance and before doing so, ask questions such as is the patient conscious and breathing. Annex A of Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 03/2013 requires an ambulance to be called automatically as a mandatory contingency response upon a code blue or red being called, and directs staff to await updates from the scene. This PSI is not currently being followed at HMP Guys Marsh.

xvii. Frazer did not have any contact with his family whilst at HMP Guys Marsh and when his mother was told of his death, she thought it was a mistake as she thought he was still at HMP Winchester. She had been writing to Frazer at HMP Winchester through the email a prisoner service. There was no evidence her correspondence had reached Frazer. Email a prisoner is based on the person in the community who wants to contact the prisoner, entering the prisoner’s location in the prison estate, rather than their unique prison number. If the location is wrong or the prisoner has been moved, the prisoner will not receive the contact.

xviii. Frazer told prison staff during his induction at HMP Guys Marsh and the ACCT assessment that he was in contact with his family and he used his parents for support. Familial contact can be a key protective factor in the management of a person’s mental health. In the personal information section of Frazer’s NOMIS records, he was recorded as having no next of kin. There is no record the contact details of his next of kin were discussed with him. This evidences missed opportunities to involve Frazer’s family in his care and management prior to his death.

xix. Evidence was given that at the time if there was no next of kin recorded for a prisoner at HMP Guys Marsh a monthly report would reveal this and prisoners would be spoken to about this. There is no record Frazer was spoken to about this and it did not appear from the prison there was a clear process as to how next of kin is detailed or checked.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. There is inequity within the system of the treatment of a person with mental illness in the prison setting compared to an individual in the community, due to the fact that in the community a person would be placed in a hospital setting on the day they were deemed to require hospital admission, however in prison there are delays in transferring a prisoner in the same situation to hospital.

ii. There is a lack of NHS guidance, and joint guidance with HMPPS, on the identification, management, and treatment of someone with self-neglect in the prison setting.

iii. There is a lack of a national directory detailing the facilities and provision of healthcare at individual prisons across England and Wales, and associated guidance on the transfer of individuals between prison establishments when they are under the care of the healthcare teams and are not placed on medical hold. There is a lack of guidance on consultation with prison doctors where a prisoner is receiving medical care, whether that be for physical or mental health, when there is consideration by the prison to transfer the prisoner who is not placed on medical hold. Further, there is a lack of consultation with the healthcare team at the proposed receiving prison to ensure they can provide the appropriate care for the person.

iv. There is a lack of national guidance for healthcare teams working in prisons around the handover of healthcare of a prisoner to the receiving prison when they are transferred to another prison.

v. There is a lack of national specification in respect of prison healthcare units.

vi. There is lack of national guidance for both senior management and operational prison staff in relation to the handover of a prisoner in advance of their transfer, not specific to, but especially those with complex needs, when transferring between prisons.

vii. The lack of ACCT quality assurance, or audit, between day 7 of the ACCT and the post-closure review.

viii. There is lack of automatic flagging of a missed ACCT review at HMP Guys Marsh and this could also be a national problem.

ix. Relevant individuals, such as key workers are not being invited to attend ACCT reviews at HMP Guys Marsh in line with ACCT 6 guidance.

x. The keyworker scheme is not being delivered in line with national guidance at HMP Guys Marsh.

xi. The colour of the cell doors and bedsheets at HMP Guys Marsh, and possibly at other prisons nationally, being very similar can camouflage ligatures.

xii. PSI 03/2013 is not being followed at HMP Guys Marsh as there is no immediate call to the ambulance service when a code blue or red is raised.

xiii. There is a lack of process regarding the recording of a prisoner’s next of kin and involvement of them at HMP Guys Marsh.

xiv. The email a prisoner system is dependent on the person wanting to contact the prisoner knowing their location, so if the prisoner is transferred to another prison and the person contacting them is not aware, contact which can be a protective factor particularly in a prisoner’s mental health care, will not be facilitated.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 May 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that the death was the result of:

Suicide, whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1a Hanging","Katie Madden was declared deceased on 4 June 2023 at the [REDACTED] in Suffolk.

Kate had been found by a friend, hanging [REDACTED]

Kate’s friend had attended after not being able to contact her for a couple of days.

Kate was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and emotionally unstable personality disorder which made her act impulsively when faced with emotionally painful situations and stress.

Kate had previously received a Claire’s Law Domestic Violence Disclosure, and was known to be in a toxic relationship. Kate had historically and recently been the victim of domestic violence.

Kate was known to both Mental Health Services, and Social Services, and her children were in care.

Despite restrictions in place, Kate had argued with the subject of the Domestic Violence Disclosure just prior to her death. During the argument Kate was told to go and kill herself.

Kate’s toxic relationship, in conjunction with Kate’s known mental health conditions, affected her state of mind and therefore contributed to her death.","1. No evidence was seen that recipients of a ‘Clare’s Law’ Domestic Violence Disclosure are treated as being of greater vulnerability, or at a higher risk, when Child Services are undertaking investigations regarding the provision of children’s care, and removal of the children from a parent is being considered. It was heard in evidence that the Social Worker appointed to this case, quite properly focused on what was in the best interest of Kate’s children. There was however no formal system in place to provide additional support for Kate herself, even though she was known to be vulnerable.

2. It was identified that when Kate was informed there may be an application to the Family Court to place her children into care (using the Public Law Outline process), the impact of such a decision on her mental health, or physical wellbeing was not taken into consideration. As a recipient of a ‘Clare’s Law’ Domestic Violence Disclosure, it was acknowledged that she was of greater vulnerability, but no system is currently in place which allows a risk assessment to be undertaken at the time the Public Law Outline notification is given to a parent. The day after Kate was told of the Public Law Outline notification, she intentionally crashed her car in an unsuccessful attempt to end her life, requiring 4 weeks in an Intensive Treatment Unit to recover from the serious injuries she received.

3. Once the Public Law Outline process was initiated, independent legal advice was provided, and a voluntary sector advocate supported Kate through the legal process. However, Kate received no independent support from Social Services, and had no independent professional to undertake a holistic review of her case, in light of her known circumstances and vulnerabilities. It was heard that mental health professionals had assumed Kate had a Social Worker of her own, and expressed surprise when finding out that she did not.

4. Safeguarding referrals made to the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub in respect of Kate’s children were viewed in isolation, with no system in place to assess any additional risks posed to Kate herself. There were no additional steps, or risk assessments undertaken in relation to Kate, even though she was a recipient of a ‘Clare’s Law’ Domestic Violence Disclosure and therefore known to be more vulnerable.

5. In 2022 it was recognised by a Clinical Psychologist that Kate could benefit from schema-based cognitive behavioural therapy, which is not routinely available on the NHS.

The psychological review had been ordered by the Family Court, and funding for this course needed to be applied for.

Applying for funding involved requests to the Legal Aid Board, Integrated Care Board (Individual Funding Request), Wellbeing Service and Social Services, none of whom provided the funding, with each suggesting contacting one of the other agencies involved.

An experienced mental health clinician with many years’ experience described the ‘whole route as very complicated’ and ‘it was difficult to find a solution for funding’. In addition, funding was very rarely made available, and as a service they were usually unable to meet patient expectations (who believe a treatment might be made available), where in reality it almost certainly would not be available.",False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False

Murphy,Cheshire,NHS England,On 29 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Emma Louise MORRIS aged 39. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 May 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Suicide,"Emma Morris had a medical history of anxiety and depression. She had suffered a deterioration in her mental health and on 20 September 2023, deliberately walked in front of a bus on the slip road of junction 39, Chester, heading towards the A55. A gatekeeping assessment had been completed by a mental health practitioner of the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team on 19 September where the practitioner found that an informal inpatient admission to a mental health ward was clinically indicated, but this could not be facilitated immediately as there were no beds available nationally. She was therefore under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team at the time of death.","The gatekeeping assessment included a mental health state examination, where it was the clinical opinion of the mental health practitioner from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team that Ms Morris required an inpatient hospital admission to a mental health ward as there was an immediate risk to her safety as she was found to be a high risk of walking in front of a car. Whilst Ms Morris agreed to an informal admission, this was not possible at the time of assessment as there were no beds available nationally within the NHS or privately. As an inpatient admission was not possible, the option was to attend the Accident and Emergency Department or to remain in the community whilst waiting for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris had been informed that if she attended the Accident and Emergency Department, there could be a wait of three days for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris did not wish to wait in the Accident and Emergency Department for three days. A safety plan was agreed that Ms Morris would stay overnight with a family member, and would remain under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team who would review the following morning. The family felt that it was pushed for Ms Morris to stay overnight with a family member as there was no alternative to keep her safe. During the course of the inquest, I heard that there is national pressure on hospital trusts as there is a national increase in people waiting for inpatient beds. I am therefore concerned that there is a risk of future deaths as it is not possible to access inpatient mental health beds at the time of clinical need.",True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday.

I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide.

I recorded a medical cause of death of:
1a asphyxiation via plastic bag and inhalation of nitrogen gas.","Mr Ladapo had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and depression. He had undergone several hospital admissions, had been treated by the Camden & Islington (C&I) early intervention service and was at the time of his death being treated by one of the C&I rehabilitation & recovery teams.","1. Mr Ladapo lived with his sister, who wanted very much to be involved with his care. However, I did not hear any evidence of engagement with her by C&I, either:

- generally, during his time with the early intervention service or the rehabilitation & recovery team; or
- when in April 2022 he was found to have ordered a bolt gun on the internet that was only intercepted because it was discovered by the delivery driver; or
- on transfer from the early intervention service to the rehabilitation & recovery team in June 2022.

Lack of engagement with families is a story that I have heard often in inquests, and was the subject of prevention of future deaths reports that I sent to you on:

and to your predecessor on:

2. Mr Ladapo was noted to have deteriorated by the time of his consultation on 19.1.2023, and he was still depressed on 16.2.2023, but the psychiatrist who saw him on each occasion omitted to ask him whether he felt suicidal.

This was the error of an individual, but it too is an omission that I have observed and written to C&I about before. Furthermore, the initial management review did not identify the omission.

I am concerned that the importance of exploring the suicide question does not feature highly enough in the consciousness of C&I staff.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 March 2024.

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.","Mr Lyalushko took his own life by hanging, intending to end his life, on 2 January 2023. Mr Lyalushko died at his home address where he lived alone.

Mr Lyalushko was a vulnerable young man with diagnoses of autistic spectrum disorder, anxiety, depression and agoraphobia. Mr Lyalushko was known to express suicidal ideation and had made suicide attempts. Mr Lyalushko had extensive involvement with mental health services throughout his life, including with Gedling Local Mental Health Team under Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust from August 2015 to August 2019, and from July 2020 to March 2022.

A request for the involvement of Gedling Local Mental Health Team with Mr Lyalushko was sent to the service by Mr Lyalushko’s General Practitioner on 22 November 2022. For reasons which have not been ascertainable, no action was taken in response to that request. Mr Lyalushko took his own life a little over a month later, there being no involvement of mental health services with him at the time of his death.

Detailed findings as to how Mr Lyalushko came by his death are described within a written determination dated 15 March 2024, appended to this report","1. Inadequate review and incident investigation following a death

Following Mr Lyalushko’s death, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust completed an SI Review by way of case note review. Following evidence which considered the content of that review, the Trust stated that the review was ‘insufficient in its current form and the scope should be broadened to include the concerns raised (during the inquest hearing).’ The Trust said its Patient Safety Investigation Lead would undertake a new SI Review by 26 April 2024 (6 weeks).

I identified a number of deficiencies with the initial SI Review which had been undertaken in respect of Mr Lyalushko: it did not identify that a request from Mr Lyalushko’s GP in November 2022 for involvement of its service with Mr Lyalushko had not been actioned; it incorrectly identified areas where improvements were required as areas of good practice; and it did not involve any level of consultation with Mr Lyalushko’s family to consider whether there were any areas of concern they had which might direct elements of the review.

If there is insufficient review and learning from a death that, in my judgment, adds to the likelihood of future deaths occurring in similar circumstances.

Didcock,Nottinghamshire,"The Chief Executive, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust","On the 24 January 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Kenneth Stanley Baylis

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 26 January 2024

The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows:

Mr Baylis took his own life on 23 January 2023 whilst on unescorted leave, when he was an informal inpatient on Kingsley Ward of Millbrook Mental Health Unit. He had a history of depression, and repeated serious and escalating suicide attempts over a fourteen month period leading up to his death.
His risk of suicide was real and imminent throughout his final admission from 28.12.22. This was not properly recognised by the treating team with responsibility for his care, due to a failure to involve his family in risk assessment and support and safety planning, a failure to follow procedures regarding unescorted leave for informally admitted patients, and a failure to properly weigh up all the relevant factors which contributed to suicidal risk.
The decision on the 10 January 2023, to allow unescorted leave from the ward, was not an appropriate one.
All these omissions in care made a more than minimal, negligible, or trivial contribution to his death","Mr Baylis took his own life [REDACTED] on 23 January 2023. He died from multiple injuries. He did so with the intention of his actions leading to his death. He made four previous serious and escalating attempts to end his life from November 2021, until finally succeeding on 23 January 2023 - this was despite caring support from his family and from many of the mental health professionals that he met both as an inpatient and when supported by the community teams.

Sadly, however, the building picture of increasing risk of suicide was not fully understood by the team on Kingsley ward. During Mr Baylis’s final inpatient psychiatric admission, the seriousness and his intent to die were significantly underestimated. There was inadequate risk assessment during this last admission, lacking in detail and incomplete. His repeated reporting of lack of suicidal thoughts and intentions was not adequately challenged.

Risk assessment was also severely compromised because there was no contact made with the family until 12 January 2023, and no family involvement in key decisions made by the team.

Mr Baylis was a voluntary patient during his final admission, and was allowed unescorted leave on 10 January 2023, which gave him the opportunity to take his own life. This should not have occurred. Had there been family involvement in the decisions regarding leave arrangements, had there been greater weight given to the repeated, and very recent, very serious suicide attempts, together with more direct involvement requested of the Specialist Depression service, it is unlikely that this incorrect decision would have been made.

Accepting that it would have been difficult to deny him his unescorted leave request (as this was his wish, and he was an informal patient), had he been told this was not agreed, it would have likely precipitated either a further Mental Health Act assessment, or more likely his agreement to comply, as had occurred in previous admissions. This would have allowed for a longer treatment period, hopefully (if it had been considered) family participation in his care and support plan, as previously, further involvement of the Specialist Depression service, with a more robust management plan, that acknowledged that depression was the most likely explanation for his presentation, and a managed discharge to a safer environment.

The lack of family input during his final admission, to Mr Baylis’s risk assessment and support and safety planning, together with the serious underestimation of the real and imminent risk of death from suicide, and the incorrect decision to allow unescorted leave, all probably made a more than minimal, negligible, or trivial contribution to his death.

Trust policies and procedures regarding family involvement in assessment of risk, care plans, and MDT meetings were not followed. The Trust procedure entitled ‘Care Planned Leave/Time off the ward for inpatient areas of the mental health services division’ was not followed. There was no evidence of joint planning of leave arrangements to include family, very limited evidence of consideration of identified risks, very limited consideration of any possible leave restrictions, and no contact with family to ask them if they had any concerns about leave arrangements.

Additionally, and importantly, there was no clear evidence of an assessment of Mr Baylis’s mental state, nor a robust assessment of risk, before each period of time off the ward. There is no evidence of completion of the sheet ‘Appendix 1 of the Planned Leave procedure: Time Spent off the ward’ at any time. Had it been completed it would have captured a signature of the staff member allowing Mr Baylis to leave, details of his time leaving the ward, planned time of return, planned destination, actual time of return. This sheet was not a familiar document to the senior treating team on Kingsley ward.

Detailed findings as to how he came by his death are described within a written determination dated 4 August 2023, appended to this report","1. Family are not routinely or regularly involved in a patient's risk assessment, care plan and safety planning.

2. Inadequate suicidal risk assessment and suicide mitigation

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 January 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased died as result of suicide.,"The Deceased suffered with physical disabilities, mental health issues, and alcoholism. Her husband of 39 years was her main carer. At around 19.15 hours on 3 January 2023, the Deceased reported to Police that her husband was being violent towards her. On attending, the Police could see no visible marks or cuts but arrested her husband; the Deceased made it clear that she did not support any criminal action against him. On 4 January 2023, her husband was bailed until 28 February 2023 with conditions that he was not to return to the marital home. Police also made a Safeguarding Referral to Social Services who organised an urgent welfare visit to the Deceased that same evening. The Deceased refused all care services offered during the visit and stated that she would kill herself if her husband did not return home (but not that evening). The Deceased continued to refuse care when contacted by Social Services the following morning but was provided with the telephone number for the Safeguarding Team. Sometime between 14.45 and 15.45 on 6 January 2023 and, in a distressed state, Sylvia left a message on the Safeguarding Team’s phone requesting help. At 15.06 hours, she also sent a text to her Victim Engagement Officer stating that she could not cope on her own and requesting a call. Although a member of the Safeguarding Team spoke briefly to her on the phone at 16.30 hours, they requested Police to make an urgent welfare visit; a ‘prompt response’ was organised by Police Control Room at 16.56 hours but, owing to service demand, they arrived at 19.24 hours and found the Deceased unresponsive on the living room floor. Despite all resuscitation efforts, paramedics confirmed her death at 20.25 hours.

A hand notes to her husband and to Police were found at the scene. The notes confirmed an intention to end her life and the note to Police indicated that she felt that they had not listened to her.","Although the Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) carried out in this case has already recommended a number of issues for agencies to consider, additional matters have been observed by the Court in relation to Police action:

(i) Whilst some officers carried out their tasks effectively and appropriately, overall important steps in the Deceased’s husband’s arrest and subsequent conditional pre-charge bail did not appear to have been followed.

(ii) In particular, S47ZZA PACE 1984 requires the investigating officer to seek the views of the alleged victim on whether relevant conditions should be imposed on the person’s bail and then to inform the custody officer of these views but this was not done in this case: the first time that the Deceased was made aware of the nature of her husband’s bail conditions was when the Police brought him home after his release on bail to collect his belongings.

(iii) An earlier discussion between Police and the Deceased might have highlighted the Deceased’s deep emotional and physical dependence on her husband and the need to consider alternative options to criminal investigation with potentially more supportive care attached to them, such as the use of a DVPN/DVPO as highlighted by the DHR.",False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide,"At 16:30 on 21/09/2023 paramedics attended Thomas' home after he was discovered by family members lying unresponsive on his sofa, with empty packets of medication and a hand-written note nearby, and Thomas was subsequently declared deceased. Post-mortem examination confirmed that death was due to an overdose of multiple prescription medications. Thomas had a long history of mental health illness and was under the care of two separate secondary mental health service providers at the time of his death. Investigations post-death revealed incidental areas of learning but none of which were directly causative of his death, and none of which would have prevented his death.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

II","Dudley Integrated Health and Care NHS Trust

1. In the inquest, there was evidence that Thomas' family received letters from clinicians from Dudley Integrated Health and Care NHS Trust (DIH) requesting that Thomas made contact with them, which were sent after his death, causing obvious distress to his family. It is not difficult to see that this type of administrative error could lead to significant distress to families who are already vulnerable by virtue of their bereavement, and which could give rise to a risk of death. An RCA carried out by DIH identified that action was to be taken - namely that DIH should work with colleagues at Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (BCH) to establish and embed the process for notifying of patient deaths. However, this does not appear to be an action that has been identified in BCH's RCA report, and I am concerned by the apparent lack of collaborative working to ensure this process is carried out.
2. Secondly, the evidence on behalf of DIH was that the above action to be taken remains outstanding and has a target completion date that arises after the conclusion of this inquest. I am concerned that if this target is pushed back and/or is not met, for whatever reason, there is a risk that future deaths will occur. Upon conclusion of the inquest, I am Functus Officio, with no power to request updates from the Trust to check and ensure that the targets have been met and changes have been made. Whilst I am grateful for the efforts of reassurance provided by representatives of the Trust at the inquest, I am reluctant to dismiss my concerns, particularly where actions remain outstanding, and I have opportunity to take action now to ensure that the risk of future deaths is reduced.

1. The evidence on behalf of Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (BCH) was that there are numerous recommendations as detailed in its Root Cause Analysis (RCA) report that remain outstanding that have target completion dates that arise after the conclusion of this inquest. These dates have been pushed back once already. I am concerned that if these targets are pushed back further and/or are not met, for whatever reason, there is a risk that future deaths will occur.

It is not difficult to see that this type of administrative error could lead to significant distress to families who are already vulnerable by virtue of their bereavement, and which could give rise to a risk of death. An RCA carried out by DIH identified that action was to be taken - namely that DIH should work with colleagues at BCH to establish and embed the process for notifying of patient deaths. However, this does not appear to be an action that has been identified in BCH's RCA report, and I am concerned by the apparent lack of collaborative working to ensure this process is carried out.",False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False

Butler,Rutland and North Leicestershire,Department for Work & Pensions,"On 28 June 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nazerine Frances Anderson aged 52. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 February 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Nazerine Frances Anderson (‘Naz’) had a medical history of anxiety and depression which had been managed with medication in primary services until October 2022. Naz was referred to secondary mental health services in November 2022 after a decline in her mental health. Following a voluntary admission to the Bradgate Unit in December of 2022, Naz was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder the trigger for this having been notification that she was facing a performance review by the Department for Work Pensions (‘DWP’). Naz was discharged from the Bradgate Unit in January 2023 and was managed in the community by the Crisis Resolution & Home Treatment team. Naz’s mental health presentation fluctuated and the DWP review continued to preoccupy Naz’s thoughts. The review concluded in May 2023 and between 3 May and 11 May 2023 Naz received 3 different letters setting out different sums of money owed to the DWP. These were sent directly to Naz despite the DWP being in receipt of correspondence from Naz’s daughter asking for all correspondence to be sent through Naz’s daughter, because continued correspondence would be of serious detriment to her mental health. On 17 May 2023, Naz took an overdose [REDACTED]. She was subsequently admitted to the Leicester Royal Infirmary Emergency Department and transferred to the liver transplant unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Unfortunately, Naz was not a candidate for liver transplant and developed complications as a result of the irreversible damage caused to her liver. Naz was transferred to the Melton Community Hospital on 17 June 2023, for palliative care and passed away at 19.30 hours on 19 June 2023 with her family present.

Naz did not intend to die as a result of taking the paracetamol overdose, but sadly developed complications as a result of the damage caused to her liver, which were irreversible.","Nazerine Frances Anderson (Naz) had a history of anxiety and depression stretching back over 20 years. She had no active symptoms of these conditions until 2021 and until November 2022 her symptoms had been managed in primary care services with medication.

Naz’s referral into secondary mental health services in November 2022 followed notification by the DWP that she would have her universal credit reviewed, by the Performance Review Team.

Naz’s mental health deteriorated necessitating a period of informal admission to the Bradgate Unit on 5 December 2022 and she was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder, an excessive reaction to stress that involves negative thoughts, strong emotions and changes in a person’s behaviour. I heard evidence from a Consultant Psychiatrist that the trigger stressor for this was the DWP performance review, suggested overpayment and potential debt.

It took 6 months for the DWP review to be completed. During which time there:
a. were at least 6 missed opportunities to use an additional support tab on Naz’s DWP profile to record the details of her vulnerability and alert other DWP personnel.
b. was a failure to pass vital information between the performance review team and universal credit case handling team of the need to correspond with Naz’s daughter, because corresponding with Naz was of serious detriment to her mental health.

Naz’s mental health was managed throughout this time by the secondary health teams, and for the majority by the Crisis Resolution & Home Treatment team. The Crisis team were responsive throughout this time to Naz’s fluctuating symptoms and needs.

In the 4 weeks prior to the paracetamol overdose, despite a request for all correspondence to be directed through her daughter, Naz received 6 communications from the DWP, 2 telephone calls requiring detailed information of Naz, a journal log she didn’t understand and 3 separate letters which had a cumulative increase of the amount Naz owed of 75%.

6 days after receiving the last piece of correspondence from the DWP Naz took an overdose [REDACTED]. Those mental health professionals who had worked with Naz throughout 7 months in which her mental health had deteriorated gave evidence to me that the recurrent and predominant cause of Naz’s increased anxiety was the DWP performance review. I find on the basis of the evidence I have heard and read that this was the case.","1. Despite the DWP case workers and call handlers having the availability of an additional support tab on a profile of a customer on the DWP computer system, there were six missed opportunities to use this facility to record vital information about Naz’s vulnerability, despite Naz being tearful and distressed on the telephone on more than one occasion and advising the DWP of information surrounding her mental health and her inability to cope. This meant there was no alert to DWP staff of Naz’s vulnerability and consequently no adjustment to how communication was made with Naz. The trigger for mental health decline and adjustment disorder continued.

2. The failure to act upon a simple request for the DWP to direct communication through Naz’s daughter. This was a simple request and had been renewed by Naz during telephone calls and journal entries to the DWP. The request which had been made in writing by Naz’s daughter sat in another DWP computer system for a period of four months but even when uploaded to the main DWP computer system was not acted upon. In addition to the active requests of Naz and her daughter being overlooked, DWP staff did not proactively consider the need for communication to be directed to someone else to safeguard Naz, given her obvious vulnerability.

3. I heard evidence from the DWP of plans to introduce a number of changes. What I did not hear was evidence about how DWP operatives were going to be trained, upskilled and refreshed in their knowledge (given the toolkit already available to them) to ensure the issues identified at 1 and 2 above are not repeated with other vulnerable individuals.",False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

Murphy,London North,"Chief Executive, West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust","On 3 December 2021 an investigation was opened into the death of Mr Paz Ogbe-Millar. On 4 January 2022 an inquest was opened, which concluded at a final hearing before me on 21 October 2022.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Ogbe-Millar intentionally took his own life by jumping in front of a moving train while suffering from a relapse in cannabis-induced psychosis and that this outcome was contributed to by the following factors:

(a) The decision by the Community Mental Health Team to discharge Mr Ogbe-Millar from its service on 30 November 2021;

(b) The absence of an adequate system at the Emergency Department to record information provided by the police to the hospital staff regarding Mr Ogbe-Millar’s risk of self-harm;

(c) The decision by the Emergency Department not to allow Mr Ogbe-Millar’s mother to remain with him in the hospital, pending the arrival of the Mental Health Liaison Team;

(d) Problems surrounding the system for making referrals to the Mental Health Liaison Team;

(e) The decision of the Emergency Department not to go outside with Mr Ogbe-Millar when he said he was going outside to smoke after his mother was required to leave.","Mr Ogbe-Millar died on 2 December 2021. He was 30 years old and described by his mother as highly intelligent, articulate, charming and well read. For much of his life Mr Ogbe-Millar was a heavy cannabis user, which led to his diagnosis with cannabis induced psychosis in 2020.

Mr Ogbe-Millar received treatment from community and in-patient mental health teams at various stages, including two hospital admissions under the Mental Health Act 1983 in late 2020 and in early 2021.

On being discharged from hospital in March 2021 he enjoyed a period free of cannabis and psychosis. He was able to work, attend Narcotics Anonymous and come off his medication. This led to his discharge from the community mental health team in June 2021.

In November 2021 Mr Ogbe-Millar gave up his job and resumed using cannabis on a daily basis leading to a relapse of his mental illness. His mother sought help from the community mental health team who spoke to Mr Ogbe-Millar by telephone on 26 November 2021 and referred him to a substance abuse organisation, which did not specialise in psychosis. He was discharged by the community health team on 30 November 2021, without the team having obtained any information regarding his relapse from his mother.

In the early hours of 2 December 2021, Mr Ogbe-Millar sent a text message to his mother saying: “I’m sorry for my actions and I hope you all find peace”. His mother immediately telephoned the police, who found Mr Ogbe-Millar at home.

The police took Mr Ogbe-Millar to the Emergency Department of Watford General Hospital, which is operated by West Hertfordshire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (‘WHTHNT’) where there was an inadequate system for recording the information provided by the police to the hospital concerning his risk of self-harm.

Mr Ogbe-Millar was assessed by hospital staff later that morning as a moderate risk of self-harm and told to await the arrival of the local Mental Health Liaison Team, which is operated by the Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (‘HPUNFT’)

Despite Mr Ogbe-Millar’s risk of self-harm and the protective factor provided by the presence of his mother, she was not allowed to stay with him at the Emergency Department while he waited for the Mental Health Liaison Team. Instead, she was required to leave by staff in breach of hospital policy.

The Mental Health Liaison Team had not arrived to assess Mr Ogbe-Millar by the time his mother was required to leave the hospital due to problems surrounding the referral system.

Soon after his mother had been required to leave, Mr Ogbe-Millar left the Emergency Department unaccompanied saying he was going outside to smoke a cigarette.

He never returned and instead travelled to London, where he died after jumping in front of a high speed train at Harrow and Wealdstone train station at 10.09pm on 2 December 2021.","a. Evidence was heard regarding the appropriate level of observation by Emergency Department staff of mental health patients waiting in the Emergency Department (operated by WHTHNT) to be seen by the Mental Health Liaison Team (operated by HPUNFT). There was confusion amongst the WHTHNT witnesses as to the appropriate level of observation. This was contributed to by a lack of clarity in WHTHNT’s (a) Standing Operating Procedure entitled: “Management of Mental Health Patients in the Emergency Department (ED) at Watford General Hospital (WGH): Standing Operating Procedure (‘SOP’), Issue date 8.2021”; when compared with (b) WHTHNT’s “Emergency Department Adult Mental Health Pro-forma” Version 3, Undated (‘EDP’);

b. The SOP states in a section titled “5. Procedure” (on page 4 of 16) “Patients at moderate or high risk of self-harm or of leaving before assessment and treatment should be observed closely whilst in the ED. There should be continuous observation, and this should be documented in the mental health presentation engagement record (Appendix 1);

c. Whereas the EDP states at page 7 under the heading: “Summary of levels of risk and suggested action”, the following:
“Low: No special observations required
Medium: Consider 15-minute special observation”;

d. Emphasis has been added above to paragraphs (b) and (c) in bold text;

e. My concern is that the inconsistency between these two documents creates a risk that mental health patients at medium risk of self-harm awaiting assessment for their mental health condition in the Emergency Department may not be subjected to an appropriate level of observation.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Hayes,Essex,"[REDACTED], CEO, Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust",On 13 September 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Georgia Gypsy Catherine Dehaney-Perkins aged 36 years. Georgia Dehaney-Perkins died on 6 September 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 December 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Narrative ‘Ms Dehaney-Perkins consumed prescription medication and alcohol and had been previously found at the same location when she went missing. It is not possible to determine if Ms Dehaney-Perkins intended the outcome to be fatal’ with a medical cause of death of ‘1a a Combined Alcohol and Drug Toxicity ( [REDACTED] )’,"Georgia Dehaney-Perkins was found deceased on 6 September 2022 on Latton Common, Harlow by her family who had reported her missing that morning and gave this as the last known location of Georgia. Police did not attend Georgia’s home address and downgraded her from a missing person to a concern and did not inform the family of the decision. Ms Dehaney-Perkins sought medical assistance when she began to struggle with her mental health and following a misdiagnosis of cancer. Ms Dehaney-Perkins had a known history of self-harm, suicidal ideation and being found as an at-risk missing person with inpatient admissions for care and treatment due to her deteriorating mental health. Ms Dehaney-Perkins’ recent overdose of medication required admission to hospital as she could not keep herself safe. Ms Dehaney-Perkins attempted to hang herself on 28 August whilst in her bathroom on the ward. Ms Dehaney-Perkins was discharged on 2 September 2022 with 14 days’ supply of her medication. A 24-hour follow-up call had not been made by mental health services. The Home First Treatment Team assessed Ms Dehaney-Perkins on 4 September at home and transferred her care back to her care co-ordinator. Ms Dehaney-Perkins was suffering from mental health disorder with features of self-harm that elevated when she consumed alcohol. Ms Dehaney-Perkins’ father contacted the Home First Treatment Team on the evening of 4 September asking if they had attended that day and informed the nurse that he understood that Ms Dehaney-Perkins had consumed alcohol, police had attended, and she left home with her medication. The Home First Treatment Team nurse did not attempt to contact Ms Dehaney Perkins, her partner or the police. Ms Dehaney-Perkins died due to combined alcohol and drug toxicity ([REDACTED]) that interacted to increase sedation and cardiac arrhythmia causing death.","(1) On 28 August Ms Dehaney-Perkins was agitated and distressed on return to the ward from leave and had consumed alcohol that was known to increase her risk of self-harm. [REDACTED]. Staff found Ms Dehaney-Perkins and removed the ligature.
a. Ms Dehaney-Perkins was admitted to a room with an assisted bathroom (this was not a requirement for her) with a fault in the anti-ligature safety mechanism meant that the safety feature could not be implemented.
b. There was no risk assessment about the suitability of this room for Ms Dehaney-Perkins, a patient with a self-harming history at the time of the admission.
c. The fixed-point ligature was not appropriately updated in the risk assessment and was not discussed at a discharge planning meeting.
d. The Trust Datix Report was incomplete

(2) Medication was appropriately withheld on 28 August when Ms Dehaney-Perkins returned to the ward intoxicated due to potential interaction with alcohol that can cause increased sedation,
(3) arrhythmia and fatality.
a. This risk of consuming alcohol with her specific medication was not discussed with Ms Dehaney-Perkins or family.
b. Not all incidents of consumption of alcohol on return from leave were recorded and risk assessments were not updated.
c. Ms Dehaney-Perkins had agreed to mitigations of medication management by her family that were not recorded on the care plan on discharge on 2 September. Ms Dehaney-Perkins demanded control of her medication on 4 September against concerns of her family who were forced to return medication.

(4) The Home First Treatment Team attended a scheduled appointment on 4 September and Ms Dehaney-Perkins appeared stable and updated the risk assessment that the risk of self-harm remained significant when alcohol was consumed.

He was found hanged at his home address on 3/6/23.

I recorded a conclusion of suicide at inquest.","Mr Gerasimidis had a history of mental illness manifesting as OCD and anxiety. In 2022, his condition deteriorated. His GP referred him twice to the Community Mental Health Team but the referrals were rejected with medication being prescribed instead, together with advice to contact Talking Therapies.

He was taken on to CMHT workload after being assessed by the Psychiatric Liaison Team in Royal Cornwall Hospital in November 2022. The preferred course of treatment was psychological treatment in the form of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with Exposure Response Prevention. There was a waiting list of a year.

In May 2023, Mr Gerasimidis became worse. It was felt an informal admission to hospital was required but a bed was not available. He was found hanged at his home address on 3 June 2023.","The Trust’s Patient Safety Review identified the following concerns:

- When Mr Gerasimidis was referred by his GP to the community mental health team, he was screened out, in part, due to challenging staffing issues;
- No care coordinator was appointed owing to a shortage of staff;
- The Trust had and continues to have vacancies at consultant level;
- The family was wrongly advised the Trust was not commissioned to treat OCD;
- The family was not informed of a nearest relative’s right under the Mental Health Act to request a case review by an AMHP;
- Psychological treatment in the form of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with Exposure Response Prevention had a waiting list of one year;
- In May 2023, when it was felt Mr Gerasimidis required an informal admission into hospital, no beds were available.

The difficulties with staff recruitment and bed availability are long term problems in the Cornwall coroner area. The Patient Safety Review suggests Cornwall has fewer beds for its population than other areas.

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,On 15 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Shahzadi Khan. The investigation concluded on 23 November 2023 and the conclusion was one of narrative: suicide contributed to by a failure to effectively and appropriately manage her care in the community following discharge from hospital. The medical cause of death was 1a) drug toxicity.,"On 29 December 2022, Shahzadi Khan was detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act due to her mental state and the risks she presented. She was found to have had a manic episode with psychotic symptoms. Due to a lack of beds, she was placed in a privately-run mental health hospital in Norfolk. She remained there until her discharge to the family home on 26 January 2023. She was commenced on olanzapine and zopiclone for her mental health whilst an inpatient.

Her diagnosis on discharge was mania with psychotic symptoms. She was to remain on olanzapine in the community. Her placement out of area contributed to disjointed and inadequate discharge planning to support her in the community and was exacerbated by poor communication between the team managing out of area placements and the local team. As a consequence, the aftercare planning did not take place in accordance with S117 Mental Health Act.

This was exacerbated by a failure by all health professionals involved in her care within the mental health trust to recognise that she needed to be referred on to the Trafford Shared Care pathway. A referral would have ensured she received support and care for at least 12 weeks when she returned to the community. There is no clear reason for this failure.

She was seen by the Home-Based Treatment Team (HBTT) on 28 January and 2 February, then discharged back to her GP. Within a week of that discharge from HBTT, which meant she had been left with no mental health support, she had deteriorated significantly. On 9 February her GP sent her to hospital for emergency assessment due to her presentation. She was discharged home to be seen by the Home-Based Treatment Team on 11 February. She was seen by that team on 11, 12, and 13 February.

There was still no recognition of the fact that the Trafford policy was not being followed. She had indicated her lack of compliance with olanzapine, suicidal thoughts and her behaviour on 13 February was erratic. On 14 February 2023 she took a fatal overdose of prescribed zopiclone at her home address.","1. The inquest heard evidence that a shortage of mental health beds nationally meant that the situation that arose here of a placement out of area many miles from home was not unusual and that private beds were being used on a regular basis due to a shortage of NHS beds. The inquest heard that this meant that there were a number of consequences as a result of such placements which could, as in Ms Khan’s case, impact on a patient and increase the risk they presented. In particular:
• A family could not easily stay in contact and visiting was almost impossible. This meant a patient felt more isolated and their family could not provide information effectively to the treating clinicians.
• Where a non-NHS bed was being used or an out of trust bed was being used, notes were not easily shared as different electronic systems were used.
• Out of area trusts/private providers would not be familiar with local arrangements to support discharge and had to rely on local trust teams to put plans in place which could, as in this case, lead to less effective communication

2. There was evidence from her family that her deterioration was in part due to her going through the menopause and that had there been better awareness of this as a factor in mental health deterioration for some women and better support in place, interventions could have taken place at an earlier stage and been more effective.

3. The inquest heard that due to its size the mental health trust covers a number of areas. Each area has its own systems and pathways. Lack of understanding of these pathways by coordinating teams meant that patients were not being moved onto the correct pathway for care. The inquest heard that this was compounded by a lack of awareness by the Trafford HBTT of the local pathway for a patient such as Ms Khan and the need for a clear discharge plan to be in place that was understood by all those involved in a patient’s care including her family and mental health care workers.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 January 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,"On 25 June 2023 Rachel Mortimer took her own life. She was found by her son in her garden hanging [REDACTED].

In December 2022 Rachel Mortimer took an overdose of [REDACTED]. A Mental Health Act assessment was undertaken but she was not deemed to require sectioning at this time. On 18 June 2023 Rachel was seen by the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) at Barnsley Hospital after taking an overdose of prescribed [REDACTED] and trying to hang herself. She said she had been having suicidal thoughts for a long time, she did not regret her actions and that thoughts of her family did not stop her. She was assessed by the MHLT as having risk of future impulsive self-harm and suicide when using alcohol and risk of further deterioration of her mental state without timely appropriate mental health support to develop coping skills. She was referred to IHBTT and was discharged from hospital. No MHA assessment was undertaken.

She was seen by IHBTT and her risks of emotional dysregulation without engaging in therapy and risk of harmful alcohol use were identified. She was to be referred to BSARCS and told to refer herself to recovery services as mitigation. She was assessed as low risk of suicide even though she had initially stated she was not regretful of what was done and disappointed that she had not died, she was assessed as not having current suicidal thoughts or intentions of suicide and wanted to engage in therapy. She was provided with contact numbers to call if she wanted to discuss her mental health at any time.

Unfortunately, whilst she was referred to BSARCS she was not accepted. Despite this being a risk factor no other mitigation was offered at this time and therefore the risk was not mitigated.

On 21 June at 4pm IHBTT Rachel’s mother contacted IHBTT with concerns, she was told that Rachel should contact the GP for access to services and that they could not provide any information due to data protection. At no point was Mrs Mortimer provided any information on what to do if she was concerned for Rachel's safety such as taking her to ED or that Rachel could contact certain mental health services to discuss her feelings in a crisis. A further call was made at 5.30pm, an hour and a half later, by Rachel’s son, who expressed concerns that she was expressing suicidal ideas, again no signposting was given. A further call was made on the same day by paramedics with concerns and again they were told that she had been advised to contact her GP. No signposting was provided or consideration given to the fact previously identified risks which had not been mitigated and she was drinking which had been identified as having a risk of future impulsive self-harm and suicide.

Despite these 3 contacts by family and paramedics, at no point was any safety netting in terms of the options available if they were concerned provided, such as to take her to ED or for her to call any mental health services given. A phone call was made that evening to Rachel but as police were with her she was unable to discuss and asked for a call back later which was not answered.

IHBTT discussed Rachel on 22 June 2023 and decided she should be called for a review of her mental state and risks and to offer secondary mental health follow up. 7 telephone calls were made between 22 and 26 June with no success. IHBTT knowing that she had had 2 previous suicide attempts, had risk factors that had not been mitigated and had recently been contacted on by family with significant concerns that she was suicidal the IHBTT treatment team took no further action and on 26 June, with no contact, assessed her as low risk due to lack of contact.","1. Following concerned calls by family no advice was provided on what options were available to them if they were concerned for their family member's safety and no provision of services that could be called to discuss her mental state.

Her separation anxiety had become so severe that it also began to impact her husband and his ability to leave her alone for any significant length of time and carry out his own work. She saw her GP on 16 and 30 June, and on 30 June she was referred to the Crisis Response Team. On both 5 and 8 July, she left a note for her family and took a taxi to a train station and multi-storey car park respectively. On each of those occasions, Nadia was found by police and taken to hospital. From 10 July she received specialist in-patient care at the Peter Bruff Unit, before being discharged home on 17 July under the care of the Crisis Home Treatment Team, who attended upon her either in person or virtually until 25 July. From 23 July she began to reach out to other professional colleagues (she had been a counsellor herself) via text message and email and made desperate pleas for help, to such an extent that one of these professionals called the police. On 26 July she recorded a video message for her daughter and left a handwritten note for her husband and daughter. She took sleeping tablets and appeared to have drunk some wine as well. When her husband returned home that evening, he found her hanging [REDACTED]. A post-mortem examination confirmed the medical cause of death to be; 1a Hanging. The toxicology report was consistent with medication that Nadia had been taking, both prescribed and over the counter remedies. Despite a clear desire to want to get better, intervention from professionals and the support of a dedicated husband, Nadia’s mental health declined to such an extent that she appeared to be unable to cope with her life as it had become. I concluded that she undertook the act of hanging herself [REDACTED], that act caused her death and that Nadia intended that that would be the outcome.","(1) Failure to update Nadia’s records with the outcomes of referrals that were made and whether such referrals were accepted or declined, either for Nadia or her carer.

(2) Failure to include within her records considerations and professional opinions reached on the prospect, or not, of readmission for in-patient treatment together with the final decision and rationale.

(3) Lack of bespoke care plans tailored to Nadia’s needs. Notwithstanding the fact Nadia had begun to disengage and declined to be involved in her care planning, more personalised plans could have been drafted taking into account her personal characteristics, needs and past medical history.

(4) Evidence of “cutting and pasting” into Nadia’s care plan from another patient’s care plan.

(5) Failing to undertake risk assessments at all relevant and appropriate stages and/or failure to record that such an assessment had in fact taken place and what the outcome was.

(6) Failing to provide a “RAG” rating to risk assessments and/or to indicate where required that a risk exists.

(7) Failure to include risk management and contingency planning within Nadia’s care plans as well as key elements of her condition at that time, including her recent inpatient admission.

(8) The potential for over-reliance on Nadia’s husband, albeit he was only too willing to support her and care for her, and the need to balance maintaining Nadia’s care and treatment in the community with the need to support her carer as well.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

He sought medical assistance and was assessed by the Hounslow liaison psychiatry service on 18 August 2021. At that time he did not disclose any plans to take his own life, but did confirm he was having suicidal thoughts and thoughts that he could not continue living. Due to poor communication from the hospital to the General Practice, the intended prescription for antidepressant medication was not provided.

The team acknowledged that there were “problems” with sending out letters at the time, and no evidence was brought before the court that this issue has now been resolved. Letters should be dispatched within 24 hours of attendance. Communication between the various community teams and setting out the treatment plan to the patient are important factors that were not effective during Tom’s care and remain a concerning omission where there may be a simple and effective remedy.

3. It was acknowledged that obtaining collateral information from the family is vital, but in this case was delegated to a very junior member of the team who was in the early stages of her training. It should be considered if this task is appropriate to delegate, and if so what information should be sought from families/carers and how that should be effectively used to support patient care.

4. The Trust showed good intentions of reviewing the training programme, but were unable to evidence that planned 6 monthly audits had actually taken place, and so there was no evidence before the court that the new training that had arisen from the serious incident findings was effective. Introducing new training, templates and supervision performance appraisals all seem to be positive interventions, but in the absence of any process to audit their effectiveness, it is concerning that the Trust have no way in which to judge their impact.",True,False,False,True,True,False,True,True

Stewart,Surrey,Chief Executive Officer Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,"On 10 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Larry Stephen SPRIGGS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 December 2022. The inquest was heard without a jury.

Mr. SPRIGGS died of:
1a. Multiple injuries

The jury returned the following narrative conclusion:

Frimley Park (23 May - 25 May)

Mr Spriggs was admitted to Frimley Park Hospital on 23 May 2021 after attempting to commit suicide by overdosing [REDACTED]. He was assessed as suffering a mental health crisis and placed into a high-risk category. He was kept at Frimley Park Hospital until he was transferred to Farnham Road Hospital.

Farnham Road (25 May - 27 May)

Upon admission to Victoria Ward at Farnham Road on 25 May 2021 at 6:45pm, Mr Spriggs's risk was assessed as low, compared to the assessment of his risk at Frimley Park Hospital as high. Upon clerking-in he presented as calm, regretful and rational, presenting as low risk to self with no suicidal ideation at the time. The reduction from a previously assessed level of high risk to low risk made a possible contribution to his death as this may have impacted the urgency of the risk management plan. The assessment did however recommend that 1-1 observations should continue.

During the first night of his stay in Farnham Road Hospital, Mr Spriggs attempted to self-discharge in the early hours of the morning due to high dissatisfaction of the room, isolation and observation regime. Mr Spriggs was persuaded to remain on the ward by staff.

The consultant psychiatrist on the ward made a preliminary diagnosis for Mr Spriggs of an acute stress reaction, he noted that Mr Spriggs displayed no symptoms to have reached the threshold for pathological mental illness. The consultant psychiatrist did note that Mr Spriggs displayed fluctuating levels of anxiety from the collateral history. The consultant psychiatrist prescribed no anti-anxiety medication at this time and the failure to do so possibly contributed to Mr Spriggs death.

Mr Spriggs was offered anti-hypertension medication following high blood pressure readings on 26 May 2021 but turned it down. On 27 May 2021 he decided to proceed with taking this medication when offered again.

The decision to reduce Mr Spriggs observations from 1-1 to intermittent was made on 26 May 2021 following assessment. The reduction in observations to intermittent made a material contribution to Mr Spriggs death.

Mr Spriggs was not expecting the environment he was placed into (both the setup of his room and the isolation period which was policy at the time for Covid-19) this led to a higher state of anxiety, reflected in the distressed texts sent to his partner.

His partner received additional distressed texts from Mr Spriggs on 26 May 2021, stating ""get me out of here"" and ""it feels like a prison"" and ""there is something in my tea"".

Following a conversation between a member of staff and Mr Spriggs partner, the details of these texts were recorded on Mr Spriggs records. Staff on the following shift failed to make themselves aware of this important information. This failure made a material contribution to Mr Spriggs death.

27 May

On the morning of 27 May 2021, during a review of his blood test results Mr Spriggs was offered anti-hypertensive medication, vitamin D tablets and sleeping medication, which he was then willing to take. Mr Spriggs had reported to the doctor that his room and the isolation was causing him a lack of sleep and that he was not feeling very well.

On the morning of 27 May 2021— Mr Spriggs was in communication with his partner still telling her that he wanted to leave but that he had to call her back as staff members had entered his room for observations.

At 9:48pm on 27 May 2021, Mr Spriggs was given his medication that had been offered earlier in the day.

At approximately 9:52pm on 27 May 2021, the CCTV picks up the last movement from inside Mr Spriggs room.

Between 9:54pm - 9:57pm on 27 May 2021, Mr Spriggs exited the window and fell to the ground which was recorded on CCTV.

[REDACTED]

Observations on the night of 27 May 2021

On the evening of Mr Spriggs death, the observations that were carried out on Mr Spriggs were inadequate. There were inconsistencies in the quality of observations, the observation sheet was pre-populated with observation timings, the timing of observations were not random, inaccurate engagement codes were entered onto the observation sheet and conversations with Mr Spriggs did not take place, these failures made a material contribution to Mr Spriggs death.

Following from these inadequate observations, the handover to the next HCA did not take place verbally and the inaccurate observation sheet was left in the lounge on the ward, instead of in the nurses station. Induction training for staff on the evening of 27 May 2021 was inadequate and failed to explain what an observation should include and how they were to be carried out. The second sheet of the formal induction checklist document for the evening of 27 May 2021 was not signed by the inductor. The effect of these failures meant that arrangements to manage the observation regime were inadequate and made a material contribution to Mr Spriggs death.

The death was contributed to by neglect.

The death was caused or more than minimally contributed to by the failure on the part of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to ensure the adequate implementation of intermittent observations in relation to Mr Spriggs's care.

Access to notes - the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessing of NHS notes. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individual’s notes is not provided as standard.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 October 2023. I made a narrative determination, which I attach.","Michael Hindes killed himself [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. One week before he died, he called 999 because he felt suicidal. This was late in the evening on Monday, 8 May.

He was discharged with a plan for follow up by the community mental health team (CMHT). I was told that the local CMHT meets at the beginning of every week, and then there is sometimes a delay before an appointment is made, so it was likely that Michael would have to wait an absolute minimum of a week to be seen.

In the meantime, it was not thought necessary to refer him to the crisis team.

Michael’s family knew nothing of his mental ill health. He declined an invitation by the nurse assessing him to contact them. He did not want to worry them. Despite her awareness of the multiple therapeutic benefits of the input of a patient’s loved ones, the assessing nurse did not in any way try to persuade Michael to allow her to do this.

The first that Michael’s family heard of Michael’s mental ill health was when they heard of his death. I am sure that, had they been made aware of it while he was still alive, they would have done everything in their power to support him and to engage with the mental health services.

Families very often complain to me at inquest that mental health services have not done enough to try to bring them in to a patient’s care. In spite of the frequency of this occurrence, the lesson does not seem to be being learnt.

Wilkinson,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton","CEO, Southern Health Foundation Trust; Mental Health, Learning Disabilities & Autism and Childrens Care Director and Deputy Chief Delivery Officer, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care Board; NHS England",On 4 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Clare Taylor aged 33. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased impulsively took her own life (by hanging) whilst suffering increased emotional dysregulation against a background of emotionally unstable personality disorder.,"The Deceased was found in a lifeless state in the garage at her family home at approximately 09.15 on the morning of 25 June 2022 by her partner, who had last seen her alive when the couple went to bed at approximately midnight on the evening of 24 June 2022. She was found suspended. The evidence indicated that she had secured the ligature herself before lowering herself into it. The evidence established that she had died at some point in the early hours of the morning - it was known that she was not sleeping. There were no suspicious circumstances concerning the death. The Deceased was diagnosed with EUPD and ADHD and was receiving therapy and support from the community mental health team and from her GP in respect of physical pain. She had been struggling in the months prior to her death with emotional dysregulation, reflective of her EUPD but influenced in part by a programme of gradual reduction in her medications, which she had requested. The evidence was not able to establish that the change in her medication had chemically caused an instability in her emotions (and it was recognised that both the long term and concomitant use of her various prescription medications were clinically indicated and without contra-indications). However, the psychological impact of reduction, coupled with increasing social stressors and an increasingly subjective feeling of isolation, abandonment and lack of being heard in the last few weeks of her life are believed to have all contributed to an increasing internal narrative which led, on the evening of 24 June 2022, and without warning, to a spontaneous and impulsive act against an increasing background of emotional dysregulation. There was no evidence to indicate that her death had been an accident or a cry of help (given the timing and nature of the act). In the context of her complex diagnosed conditions however, the risk of dangerous and impulsive acts with impulsive intent was recognised, but not in all the circumstances expected.","1. It was recognised in evidence and in submission to the Court by representatives of the Trust, that there is and remains a fragmented relationship between mental health and physical health services, with little inter-service connectivity. It was recognised that ideally services for those with both mental and physical health diagnoses should be connecting in a seamless, timely and collaborative manner - specifically through the joint commissioning of services, to support patients of all ages. Nationally it is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in this death), impacts on both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst local initiatives have been explored by SHFT and by the ICB - Project Fusion I understand is such an example - much of the development of such services falls outside of scope and commissioning. Consequently, there is a significant and pressing need for connectivity between mental health services and those services supporting neurodivergent patients. It was noted in evidence e.g. that SHFT do not currently have a comorbidity policy that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental health condition and a learning difficulty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other NHS organisations within the Southampton (or in fact the wider Hampshire) area - save for private clinics, which many cannot afford. The facts in this case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity between services is still too little and too slow. More needs to be done, and with greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to be sufficiently and appropriately met in the future and similar deaths prevented.

2. Evidence before this inquest indicated that SHFT has recognised that the mental health provision for those with personality disorders must move towards an individual, therapeutic and trauma-informed approach, which is both compassionate and recovery focused. It is evident that the 'Personality Disorder Pathway' currently being developed is an important step towards that, enabling practitioners and services to take a more holistic and person-centred approach, reducing risk and improving outcomes. I am aware that SHFT have been encouraged to review and further develop the Pathway. I am concerned that that must occur, and at pace.

3. I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being sufficiently, effectively and meaningfully listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatment or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions. There remains an over-focus on patient centric assessments and patient only responses. It is recognised that patients can present quite differently to and in the presence of their families, who know them intimately, to how they may (or may be able to) present to assessing clinicians - with or without the intent to mask their condition. Whilst consent to share is an understandable barrier in some cases, there should not be a bar to listening to or to actively encouraging feedback and input from families, especially where a family's concerns are heightened by any sudden or marked changes in the behaviours, mood or presentation of their relative outside of the clinical/assessment environment - particularly in the case of neurodiversity. Unless all concerns are heard and considered and all available information is taken on board, holistically, there is a continuing risk that the masking of mental health conditions and the deterioration of them may occur or that significant red flags are missed. In this case, the family's increasingly desperate concerns voiced about their daughter's evident mental health deterioration in her final days went un-responded.

4. Finally, I am concerned that more needs to be done to inform and assist families, particularly in cases of patients with neurodiversity. In this particular case, the evidence found, for example, that the family were never briefed on what EUPD and ADHD really meant or on the difficulties which could present as a result of their daughter's joint diagnoses. Being unaware as to what they were to expect, they were consequently often at a loss to know how to interact with or to help her. Neither they nor their daughter received advice on possible medication withdrawal symptoms.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,True

Horstead,Essex,"Chief Executive Officer of Essex Partnership NHS Trust, Paul Scott; Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust","On 15 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Johanne Blackwood, aged 55 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 May 2023.

Johanne Blackwood (known as Jo) died on 12 June 2021 when she placed herself in the path of a train [REDACTED]. The medical cause of death was confirmed as ‘1a Multiple traumatic injuries’, 1b ‘Collision with train (locomotive).’

In a narrative conclusion I recorded that the deceased took her own life on a background of diagnoses of severe and long-standing mental health disorders including Persistent Delusional Disorder, Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder and Panic Disorder. I concluded, inter alia, that an inappropriate over-reliance upon family members to keep a vulnerable and high-risk person safe in the community, over an extended period, probably contributed to Jo taking her own life.","A central aspect of Jo’s delusional beliefs was that (a) she had not slept for years and (b) that she suffered from a fatal physical health condition. The desperation engendered by her delusional and medically entirely unfounded beliefs led to a number of suicide attempts and both voluntary and compulsory admissions to mental health units.

On 1 May 2021 Jo had attempted suicide [REDACTED], some five weeks later, she would end her life. In the light of this incident her community risk assessment, her care plan and her safety plan were not updated – as they had not been since the date of her last discharge as a mental health in-patient on 18 December 2020.

Whilst her high risk of suicide was acknowledged by the community mental health team responsible for her safety - and care, management and treatment - in the community, and notwithstanding the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, I found an inappropriate over-reliance upon her family members, principally her husband and son, to keep Jo safe in the community. This involved the family monitoring Jo 24 hours a day, seven days a week over an extended period and physically preventing her from leaving her home address unaccompanied.

This over-reliance was misguided and placed an unfair and unsustainable burden on the family, particularly in the light of a highly concerning text message sent by Jo to her Care Coordinator threatening suicide on 11 June, the day before she took her own life. Following receipt of the text and seemingly reassured in part by Jo’s apparent retraction of the threat later that day, there was a failure to undertake an urgent face to face assessment by the community team to establish whether a referral to the Crisis Team was necessary; this specific failure possibly contributed to the subsequent death.

In the circumstances I concluded that an inappropriate over-reliance upon family members to keep such a vulnerable and high-risk person safe in the community, over an extended period of time, probably contributed to Jo taking her own life on 12 June 2021.","1. Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to when, where and by (or between) whom any formal handover of responsibility as Care Coordinator (CC) for Jo took place as between a number of CCs allocated to Jo over a period of many months from the lead up to and following her discharge as an in-patient back to the community team on 18 December 2020 and through to early May 2021.

2. Consequently, the evidence confirmed, despite her clear vulnerabilities, Jo did not have an allocated Care Coordinator for several weeks up to the beginning of May 2021. The evidence also confirmed that the lack of clarity as to the timing and conduct of CC handovers and the absence of an allocated CC to work with Jo (and by extension, her family) was informed by lack of a formal policy or procedure requiring that a full, detailed, formal record of handover between Care Coordinators is to be placed on EPUT electronic records.

3. Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians/staff, has the responsibility for oversight of patient care following discharge, including responsibility for ensuring adequate and appropriate safety-netting is in place in the event of relapse, where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place/has not been replaced.

Please note that this third concern was previously raised by me with [REDACTED] CEO of EPUT (and in very similar terms) in a PFDR dated 25.02.2022 following the death of Stephanie Moyce.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that Kenneth died on 5 May 2022 when he jumped or fell from the viaduct at Durham Train station, sustaining fatal injuries. The medical cause of death was multiple injuries. I recorded a narrative conclusion which included my finding that mental health services' inadequate response to escalating risks, which were known or ought to have been known, including the failure to include family in assessment and safety/discharge planning contributed, more than minimally, to the death.","The deceased had a history of mental health difficulties and he, and his family, had been actively seeking professional help for a significant deterioration in his mental health in the days leading up to his death. These difficulties included self harm and suicidal ideation, as a result of command auditory hallucinations.

On 2 May 2022 the deceased presented at hospital via ambulance with a mental health crisis and suicidal ideation, [REDACTED]. He was clear that what would help him would be “to not go home” and that he did not feel safe at home. He was discharged in the absence of any comprehensive assessment, and in the absence of liaison with his family. The clinician assessing him did not have all of the important information to be able to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment, including in relation to recent incidents of self harm.

The deceased was seen by his care co-ordinator on 3 May 2022. The deceased again confirmed that he had drunk bleach on the command of voices, and both he and family were asking for admission. There was no comprehensive assessment. Again the clinician was not aware of important information which should have been taken into account in any assessment of risk, including in relation to self harm.

On 4 May 2022 the deceased presented at hospital via ambulance [REDACTED]. He told doctors in the Emergency Department he had done this at the command of voices, that he still felt suicidal, and if discharged he would attempt to take his life again. There was no comprehensive assessment by mental health services and the clinician was not in possession of all relevant information as to risk. The deceased was discharged on the basis that there was no indication of current suicidal ideation at the point of the assessment or objective evidence of psychosis, to his home address, where he had indicated he did not feel safe. Whilst awaiting transport the deceased left the hospital having discarded his mobile phone and was reported missing. He was assessed as medium risk by the police in the light of information provided by mental health services which had not been updated and did not include all risk events.

Having left the hospital, the deceased fell or jumped [REDACTED] on 5 May 2023, despite the efforts of police officers on the scene. Kenneth’s intention cannot be established although it is known that the deceased was suffering from a deterioration in his mental health in the days leading up to his death, including evidence of auditory command hallucinations to harm himself.

Mental health services involved with the deceased did not carry out comprehensive mental state assessments despite the escalating risks which were known or ought to have been known, and did not fully involve family members in care, safety and discharge planning, who were crucial to his safety.","(1) The serious incident investigation report in this case was not available in this case until 24.03.2023, over 10 months since the death and around 8 months outside the NHS framework guidance of 60 days for the completion of such, despite repeated requests and a schedule 5 notice being issued to attempt to obtain a copy of the draft report to inform this investigation, which was not complied with.
(2) The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.
(3) The delay in the investigation in this case is particularly concerning in a number of respects, not least in that it revealed problems in clinical record keeping, risk assessments and the consideration of hospital admission, lack of family/carer involvement, lack of comprehensive mental state examination/assessment including capacity, safeguarding and social needs and medication review and access to services.
(4) As a result of the delay in the serious incident investigation and formulation of an action plan, many of the identified actions required to remedy these difficulties were still being actioned/completed relatively recently.
(5) Further, one of the actions upon identification of a serious incident is to obtain, secure and preserve all relevant evidence. In this case the memory capture forms identified as being required in the immediate aftermath of the incident were not taken promptly and were seemingly only taken after I requested sight of them, several months after the incident and therefore when memories had already begun to fade. This was concerning given the identified problem of clinical record keeping at the time of these events.
(6) I am concerned that the extensive and continuing delays in investigating serious incidents may lead to further deaths, as lessons cannot be learnt and improvements made in a timely manner. I am also concerned that the quality of such investigations is compromised by the failure to complete memory capture forms and the passage of time before important evidence is secured.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The conclusion of the inquest was narrative.,The deceased SAM MALCOLM TAYLOR suffered mental health issues and had on previous occasions attempted suicide. Paperwork found on the deceased suggested the deceased had recently been admitted into hospital due to a suicide attempt which had left him in a coma for 3 days. Updates on the note stated the deceased would feel suicidal if he returned to the tent he seemed to be staying in. The deceased was found in his tent alone next to the RIVER WYE located by members of the public.,"(1) A prevention duty was owed to the deceased and due to Herefordshire Council communication process failure, contact was not made with him or those with whom he had approved contact prior to his death.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27/6/2023.","Kaye McCoy suffered from depression and anxiety and was diagnosed with Unstable Affective disorder. Kaye had been under the care of the Older Adults Mental Health Team since 2017 and prior to that under the care of the Adult Psychiatric Services.

On 1/9/2022, Kaye had an outpatient appointment with her consultant psychiatrist who advised admission to hospital, but Kaye declined. On 5/9/2022, Kaye took an overdose of prescribed medication with an intention to end her life, she was assessed in hospital and discharged back to the care of her care co-ordinator.

Kaye was followed up daily by her care coordinator who, on Friday 9/9/2022, again offered Kaye admission to hospital. At the inquest I determined that by this stage Kaye was in crisis and her main protective factor, which were her family, had been diluted. Kaye was expressing anger towards and was emotionally distanced from family members.

The inquest found that there was no strategy developed for the involvement of Kaye’s family in her care, and that engagement with the family by the mental health teams had been poor.

After seeing Kaye on 9/9/2022, the next follow up was scheduled for the Monday after the weekend; 12/9/2022. I was informed that follow-up and support from a Crisis or Home Treatment team was not available for Older Adults at the weekends, or indeed out of hours. Kaye was told that if her condition deteriorated she should phone the Samaritans.

Kaye McCoy taken her own life by hanging on Sunday 11/9/2022.

I determined that her death was contributed to by a failure of the mental health service to adequately respond to a severe downturn in Kaye’s mental health.","At the inquest I was referred to the National Confidential Enquiry into Suicides. I was informed that the enquiry identified key factors that should be adopted by health organisations to reduce the incidence of suicides, including:

• That there should be a strategy for engagement with the family.
• That every patient should have access to 24-hour crisis support

Neither of these key components of care were available to Kaye.

Buckett,London Inner North,Chief Executive East London NHS Foundation Trust,"On 11 November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on 30 October 2021 [REDACTED].

The investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19 May 2023.

I made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:

1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a recurrent depressive disorder and complex post traumatic stress disorder.

2. On occasions, the deceased’s psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.

3. On 26 October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.

4. At a ward round at that hospital on 28 October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.

5. The deceased’s condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of 29 October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.

6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on 29 October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.

7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on 30 October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.

8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on 29 October 2021. Staff first contacted the police at 2.10am and again at 2.46am on 30 October 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on 30 October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased’s home address.

9. At around 2pm on 30 October 2021, the deceased’s mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased’s home address, between 3-4pm on 30 October 2021.

10. The deceased should not have been permitted to leave the ward alone. Had clinical staff observed the decision not to allow the deceased out without a staff member, the deceased would not have taken their own life when they did.

11. The decision that the deceased should not be permitted unescorted leave failed to be communicated to all staff members on the ward.

12. The information that the deceased had tried to end their own life on the ward on the evening of 27 October 2021 was also not properly communicated to all staff on the ward or added to any document which concerned a proper risk of assessment of them. Also, the hospital staff did not fully comply with the patient admission policy when the deceased was admitted on 26 October 2021 as records were not properly updated and no physical health assessment was made of the deceased within 24 hours.

13. The decision that the deceased was to receive 1:1 support following the ward round of 28 October 2021 could not realistically be met because of staff shortages on the ward. There was a failure to recognise that this plan could not realistically be achieved because of those staffing issues.

14. The assessment made of the deceased before the deceased was allowed to leave the ward at 6pm on 29 October 2021 by that member of staff was inadequate as a risk assessment of the deceased’s mental state for the purposes of assessing their safety. That member of staff relied solely on the deceased’s presentation at that moment and did not consider any written record about the deceased or ask any other member of staff about how the deceased was.

15. There was a complete failure to appreciate the urgency of locating the deceased once the night staff found them to be missing at about 8pm on 29 October 2021 and to follow the hospital policy which applied to missing patients.

16. Night shift staff took far too long to contact the emergency services and failed to contact the ambulance service as advised by the police in the early hours of 30 October 2021.

17. When the police were contacted, staff completely failed to state the urgent and serious suicide risk which the deceased presented to themselves.

18. Hospital staff also failed to properly contact Billy’s family and friends after they went missing from the ward or leave messages for them which could have enabled them to be located.

19. Staffing levels on both 29 and 30 October 2021 were not adequate and this contributed to the failings set out above.

20. The failure set out above which relates to the staff member being unaware that the deceased should not leave the ward unaccompanied, amounts to a serious failure which directly caused or contributed to the deceased’s death.

21. The other failures set out above amount to missed opportunities which may directly or indirectly, have prevented the deceased’s death.",,"Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:

1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (“the unit”) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.

2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.

3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on 28 October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.

4. The “Sign in/Sign out” book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.

5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.

6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased’s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.

7. Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.

8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.

9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased’s family once the deceased was found to be missing.

10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.",False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False

Death from self-suspension while her cognition was seriously impaired by a very high blood alcohol level.

1a Hanging

1c

II Alcohol dependence","The record of inquest read as follows: ""Brenda Shields died in her home [REDACTED], Carlisle on 8 December 2022. She took her life by ligature suspension while under the influence of a very high blood alcohol level"". A narrative conclusion was given.

Brenda worked as a healthcare assistant in A&E at Cumberland Infirmary, she had for some time been alcohol dependent with binge sessions which often caused domestic friction with her husband, there was an incident of domestic violence requiring police involvement. Matters had been worse since she developed cauda equina syndrome which required neurosurgical intervention in 2021, and had ongoing low back pain which she tended to medicate with alcohol. She had had episodes of anxiety in 2005 and 2007, depression in 2016 and suicidal ideation in 2018. On 26/10/22 she was admitted to A&E in Carlisle (her own workplace) with an intentional overdose. She was followed up and treated by her GP. On 10/11/21 there was a serious incident when she was found by police on the riverbank, she had intended to enter the water but was talked down from this by her GP. Brenda was admitted to hospital [Hadrian unit] as a voluntary patient.

Brenda was not comfortable in the ward environment and on 14/11/21 discharged home to be followed up by the Crisis Team who did visit her at home the following day. Brenda's GP was not informed of her admission or discharge so was unaware of events until a prearranged telephone call on the 15th. Brenda was followed up at home and by telephone, at several contacts she was noted to be under the influence of alcohol. Brenda was discharged after a final ""MDT"" meeting on 6/12/22 [it is not clear who was involved], declining further input and denying any thoughts of self harm, a risk assessment on 8/12/22 records low or no apparent risks, this was the day Brenda died.","(1) Brenda was discharged without any planned follow up. Her family were not involved in the discharge process despite assurances that they would be, her GP did not receive discharge notification from the Hadrian unit until 8 days after the event or from the Crisis team until 10 days after Brenda's death. Referrals promised from Hadrian unit to Drug/Alcohol services and Persistent Physical Symptoms Service were not made.

(2) Inadequate weight seems to have been given to Brenda's alcohol problems and her assurances that all was, and would continue to be well were accepted at face value despite her recent history, her family find it hard to understand how she could be graded low risk on the day she died.

(3) I refer you to the PFD report I issued referring to Charlotte Grace on 29/10/19. Assurances were given in response to that report which again focused on discharge without family/carer involvement which is surely paramount.

Mrs Wood found him suspended by the neck.,"Following the death of Mr. Wood a review was conducted by the trust and the review recognised that it would have been helpful if the symptoms of delirium had been highlighted to the GP and that it would have been useful if there had been a discussion with Mrs Wood to educate her as to the possibility of delirium, and to help plan his discharge from hospital and inform her when she should seek further medical assistance,

The jury recorded a conclusion of suicide.,"On 26 March 2021 at approximately 10.11am in cell A3-10 at HMP Lewes, Andrew Dean was found with a ligature around his neck [REDACTED]. He was treated at the scene by prison staff, healthcare staff and paramedics. Andrew Dean was declared dead at 11.27am at HMP Lewes.","Following his arrival at HMP Lewes on 24 March 2021, Mr Dean was offered and attempted to make his initial ‘first night’ phone call but did not manage to speak to anyone. Over the next 36 hours, he made requests of prison staff for another opportunity to make a phone call, which were refused. During the same period, his partner tried to contact the prison through the prison switchboard, but was not able to make any contact with him. In his suicide note to his partner, Mr Dean wrote “I tried to get to talk to you but these lot here wouldn’t let me.”

I am concerned that there are no clearly defined processes to ensure that new prisoners can successfully make first contact with family members (when this does not take place on the first night) and for logging and handling incoming calls to the central switchboard from family members with concerns about a prisoner’s safety and/or requesting a welfare check.

Following the inquest, I gave the Ministry of Justice an opportunity to address these concerns by providing further evidence of any new procedures that have been put in place since Andrew Dean’s death, but they declined to do so. In my view, these are matters that require further consideration by the Ministry of Justice and HMP Lewes to avoid a risk of future deaths through self-harm or suicide.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 February 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Ben Alan Shipley died on 29 August 2019 having been struck by a train at Milne Viaduct East End after absconding from Huddersfield Royal Infirmary's Clinical Decisions Unit at 12.30. Ben voluntarily came to A&E on 28 August 2019 at 19.27 after suffering a mental health crisis. He was assessed by 2 mental health psychiatrists and a mental health nurse. He was deemed to require a section 2 detention under the Mental Health Act, but was to remain in A&E for his own safety until a bed was sourced. After a prolonged search, using various communications methods, for a bed lasting approximately 17 hours, Ben absconded from A&E, where he travelled to a railway, [REDACTED]","Ben is a 22-year-old single man who lived with his family in Lepton, Huddersfield.

On 28 August Ben was seen by his GP who referred Ben to the 'Single Point of Access' service. On 29 August Ben was at the hospital with his parents, waiting to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act when he ran away. His parents reported him as a missing person.

That afternoon Ben was struck by a train in a rural area of Huddersfield. His life was pronounced extinct at 14:14 hrs.","Ben was assessed at 22:00 on 28/08/2019. It seems to me that there are about 12 hours of delay following a 22:00 section 2 Mental Health Act assessment built into the system if there is no bed. Presumably this would be longer if Ben had been assessed earlier in the night shift. I am told beds do not become available overnight. This means Ben cannot be legally detained as the section 2 is not complete until there is a bed.

Topping,Surrey,Chief Executive Officer of The Priory Group; Chief Executive Officer of NHS England,"An inquest into the death of Miss Amy Henderson was opened on 26 April 2022 and resumed with a jury on 6 February 2023. The inquest was concluded on 23 February 2023. Evidence in respect of matters pertaining to this report was heard on 20 March 2023.

The jury concluded that Miss Henderson died on 21 March 2022 at the Priory Hospital, Woking and the medical cause of her death was:

1a Suspension

They concluded with a narrative conclusion and found that:

1. The Priory staff knew Amy had suicidal ideation, but they did not know any details concerning plans, or that she had practised tying a ligature.
2. No-one at the Priory asked her family about her suicide plans.
3. It is not possible to determine what Amy would have said to her consultant if she had been asked about suicide plans. Amy denied having any plans when asked by an HCA and she denied having thoughts of suicide in her 1:1 with a SHCA.
4. If Amy’s mother had been asked, she would have shown the screenshots from Amy’s phone and given details of Amy practising tying ligatures. Amy’s mother has no recollection of volunteering the information.
5. Despite the notes from the therapy sessions being uploaded at 16.06, there was no formal request for Amy to be reviewed. There is evidence from professionals that Amy should have been reviewed urgently on the basis of the notes, if they had been scrutinised.
6. If information about Amy practising tying a ligature had been known, there would have been more consideration given 
 bearing in mind the balance of risk and least restrictive practice.
21 March. Amy was generally compliant with staff, [REDACTED].
7. After the identification of the disabled toilet as a high-risk area in 2021, the ligature risk of the disabled toilet was not effectively managed although the Priory considered that it was.
8. Amy had unrestricted access to the disabled toilet, which was accessible to all patients, staff and visitors.
9. The jury was not able to make a finding as to whether Amy was alive between 19.35 and 19.47.

In summary the following facts, on the balance of probabilities, made a material contribution to Amy Henderson’s death:
a. Risk assessments were not performed in line with Priory policy.
b. There was no key worker present throughout Amy’s stay.
c. There were incomplete observations and little evidence of engagement with Amy during observations. Boxes were not ticked on observation and engagement records.
d. The family was not consulted or questioned about Amy’s suicide plans.
e. Therapy notes were not acted upon.
f. There was a lack of staff training in postnatal depression.
g. There was a lack of continuity of care.
h. The disabled toilet was not locked.
i. Staff knowledge of the ligature footprint was inconsistent.

Amy committed suicide. She used a [REDACTED] ligature and intended to kill herself. She is shown on CCTV entering the disabled toilet and no-one else entered it until Amy’s body was discovered.
The death was contributed to by neglect","Miss Henderson had a baby in 2021. When her baby was 11 months old she returned to work, but was signed off sick suffering from anxiety and depression. On the evening of 14 March 2022 she was taken by her family to Kingston Hospital and assessed by the liaison psychiatric team. She expressed suicidal thoughts and plans [REDACTED].
[REDACTED] She was diagnosed with post partum depression. She was advised to become an informal patient in the NHS but there was no bed available so she would have had to wait in the hospital until a bed could be found. She decided to seek a private admission the following day.

On 15 March 2022 she sought treatment at the Priory Hospital, Woking. She had a preadmission assessment with [REDACTED] a consultant psychiatrist who accepted her as a patient. She told him that she had a suicide plan but did not provide details of what it was. He assessed her as a high risk of suicide and set observations at four times an hour. She was allocated a Key Worker who was not due to be in the hospital until 22 March 2022, and a Co-worker, who had a one-to-one with her on 19 March 2022. Her overall mental health appeared to have improved when she was reviewed by [REDACTED] on 18 March 2022. The observation level was reduced to twice an hour on 16 March 2022, and then further to once an hour on the morning of 21 March 2022, on each occasion without a risk assessment being performed as specified in the Priory policy.

Later on the morning of 21 March 2022 Miss Henderson made comments during a therapy session which indicated that her mental health was deteriorating. The therapists recorded what she had said in her notes, but the concerns were not considered to be serious enough to be escalated to the nursing team. Evidence presented to the inquest suggests that Amy’s observations should have been increased at this stage. Amy was not reviewed by the nursing team when the therapists’ notes were uploaded onto the system at 16.06 on 21 March 2022. The information was not reviewed and therefore not acted upon.

Miss Henderson was last seen in person at 18.02 in the dining room. At 18.12 she entered the downstairs disabled toilet. The disabled toilet had been identified in risk assessments as a high-risk area but it was not locked. She wrote a farewell note to her parents at 18.14. She was found in the disabled toilet on the ground floor at 20.01. She had taken her own life by suspension, [REDACTED].","1. The information that Miss Henderson had practised tying a ligature was divulged by her at Kingston Hospital but not repeated on admission to the Priory Woking. The evidence given at the inquest was that there is no quick method to obtain NHS records on admission to a private hospital. A request could have been made but the records would have taken over a week to be released. The records were not sought. An ability to obtain the NHS records quickly would have been of assistance to the Priory clinicians.

2.

Brown,Birmingham and Solihull,Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust; NHS England (Health and Justice); the Phoenix Partnership (Leeds) Ltd,"On 1 February 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jai SINGH. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 March 2023. The conclusion of the jury at the inquest was;

Suicide
The following matters probably caused or contributed to Mr Singh's death:
* The failings of safer custody to appropriately communicate and document family concerns to other staff within the prison.
* The failure to use interpretation services to effectively communicate with Mr Singh by both the custodial and the healthcare teams.
* The failure to communicate relevant information within and between the custodial team and the healthcare team
* The failings to appropriately open, re-open and carry out the ACCT process.
* The failure to carry out sufficient and thorough welfare checks.
* That Mr Singh did not undergo an assessment for section 48 transfer.
* A significant lack of rigour in respect to the completion of official prison and healthcare documentation.
* That Mr Singh was not admitted to ward 2 and remained on a residential wing.

The following matters possibly caused or contributed to Mr Singh's death:
* Failings to heed and communicate family concerns by both the custodial team and the healthcare team.
* The failure to allocate an individual community psychiatric nurse as a single point of contact following the opening of an ACCT.","Jai Singh died at City Hospital on 28 January 2022 having been admitted after he was found in cardiac arrest in his cell at HMP Birmingham on 27 January 2022. Mr. Singh had asphyxiated due to placing a bag over his head. He received CPR from prison staff and paramedics and was resuscitated but had suffered irreparable brain and organ damage.

All actions taken following Mr. Singh being found in cardiac arrest on 27 January 2022 were appropriate.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a  Hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage
1b  Multi-organ failure
1c  Cardio-Pulmonary arrest due to asphyxia
II","1. A multitude of factors contributed to Mr. Singh's death across the custodial and healthcare teams within HMP Birmingham. Many steps have been taken by all organisations with responsibility for Mr. Singh's safety and health during his time at HMP Birmingham to rectify failings that have been identified such as the consistent failure to use interpreters, poor communication and record keeping within and between teams, the absence of meaningful engagement with Mr. Singh's family, insufficient consideration of family concerns and failings in the use of the ACCT system.
2. Much of the evidence at the inquest focused on the central issue of repeated missed opportunities to identify that Mr. Singh required admission to the prison's inpatient ward, ward 2, and assessment for section 48 transfer to a medium secure unit (which would have been likely to result in transfer to a medium secure unit). The consequences of the failure to transfer Mr. Singh to an inpatient setting were compounded by the fact that he was not taken onto the mental health team's caseload promptly and therefore did not have the benefit of an allocated CPN and the oversight and input of a mental health multi-disciplinary team. Many steps have been undertaken by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (who provide mental health services within the prison) to minimise the risk of such a situation occurring again.
3. However, there are two features of the mental health care provided to Mr. Singh that create a risk to the lives of others that have not yet been rectified:
   i. the fact that the mental health team multi-disciplinary team (MDT) does not include a psychiatrist; and
   ii. the absence of any ongoing risk assessment documentation for patients with mental illness within the SystemOne records at HMP Birmingham.
4. In Mr. Singh's case it is my conclusion that it is likely that if a psychiatrist had been at a mental health MDT meeting held on 19 January 2022 they would have identified that he needed to be admitted to ward 2 without further delay. At the very least the need for urgent review by a psychiatrist and CPN would have been recognised and facilitated which would in turn have led to admission. CPNs in Mr. Singh's case continually failed to identify the significance of repeatedly and consistently reported psychotic symptoms and consequently he did not receive adequate assessment and treatment which increased his risk of self harm and suicide which in turn was not sufficiently identified. The absence of a psychiatrist at the MDT creates a risk that the significance of some symptoms and presentations will not be recognised and further deaths could occur due to lack of appropriate assessment and treatment.
5. Other electronic health care records systems used in mental health settings have a rolling risk assessment document that clinicians are required to review and update at certain points in a patient's management. The risk assessment document provides a prompt to clinicians to formally consider risk and come to a reasoned, documented conclusion that then feeds into decision making. The record also provides a reliable, easily accessible source of risk history. No such facility is in use on SystemOne at HMP Birmingham. Further, the evidence given was that such a system is not being used routinely across mental health care within the prison estate and is not provided as standard on SystemOne. This creates an ongoing risk to life arising from under-estimation of risk as a result of clinicians not formally considering and assessing current risk levels, and salient risk history not being easily accessible. It is understood by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust that it should be possible to create a specific risk assessment record within SystemOne and this is being considered locally. However, the evidence given was that this issue should be highlighted nationally and that the developers and distributors of SystemOne should be involved so as to ensure the best available solution is identified.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 March 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a short-form conclusion of suicide. The medical cause of death was determined to be fatal pressure to the neck.","Ms. Findlay had a history of psychiatric illness and a long history of depression, for which she was receiving support and treatment. She was an outpatient under the care of psychiatrists at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton from 7 February 2018 until 20 August 2021. She was noted as not always engaging with medical professionals and disclosed that she had been self-medicating.

On 20 August 2021, Ms. Findlay was admitted as an inpatient at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton, following a referral from her General Practitioner for “various complaints”. Ms. Findlay had been taking the anti-depressant venlafaxine but this had resulted in unintended urinary retention and prior to her admission, her intake was being reduced by her treating psychiatrists. On 20 August 2021, following her admission, she was started on a different anti-depressant, vortioxetine and attended to by staff and medical professionals.

On 27 August 2021, Ms. Findlay discharged herself from the Priory Hospital, Roehampton. This was despite the requests of her treating psychiatrist for her to remain so that her response to her change of medication could be monitored.

At the time of discharge, no significant risks were identified and Ms. Findlay was deemed to have capacity and was deemed fit for discharge. A discharge plan was put in place.

The discharge plan for Ms. Findlay included that she was to contact the hospital to make an outpatient appointment. She was also discharged with a week’s supply of medication. A discharge summary was sent to her GP.","Although a discharge plan was implemented in Ms. Findlay’s case, it would appear that steps were not taken to contact her emergency contact and/or next of kin, such as to facilitate Ms. Findlay being supported in the community upon discharge. Ms. Findlay, having discharged herself, left the hospital with next of kin/emergency contacts not being aware of her discharge – despite her emergency contact being the person who had transported her to the Priory Hospital. No follow up appointment was made prior to Ms. Findlay’s discharge and no attempts were made to contact her following her discharge until 6 September 2021.

Wood,Kent North East,NHS Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board,"On 8 April 2022 I opened an inquest into the death of Stefan Kluibenschadl. At the inquest, which lasted two days and heard from a few of those involved in Stefan’s short life, I concluded on 1 December 2022 with a narrative conclusion “He died as a consequence of his own actions, his intention being unknown”","Stefan suffered from autism and was at school at Laleham Gap where he had been since April 2013. He had annual reviews of his placement at the school and was doing well and at the start of the winter 2020 term had managed to obtain a part time job and was considering career options of either the army or food industry. He had an extremely supportive family and parents who made significant efforts to ensure that he had access to the support he needed.

Both his parents and his school noted a decline in his mental health in December 2021 and he met with the school alongside his parents and his timetable was amended and steps to obtain additional support considered. On 14 January 2022 he told a member of staff at school that he had contacted the National Suicide Prevention helpline but later appeared to deny this. He apparently did not express any intent to harm himself but did express feelings of being low.

His parents, having tried to see what help was available locally, took steps to try to arrange private counselling and arranged for this to start after the February half term. The service the family approached did not consider Stefan was suitable for short term counselling and advice was given to approach his General Practitioner (GP). On 15 March 2022 Stefan’s mum spoke to his GP and asked for a letter to apply for funding from specific autism related counselling which his GP did but this was rejected and the letter received on 17 March 2022. At the consultation which occurred on the telephone between Stefan’s mother and his GP there was no mention of suicidal ideation or self-harm. On Sunday 20 March Stefan was found hanging at home in his bedroom by his family and he was taken to hospital and subsequently transferred to Kings College Hospital where sadly he died on 26 March 2022.","1. During the course of the inquest reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance “Autistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management.” Published on 28 August 2013 and in particular paragraph 1.1.4 which states that “Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with autism has a case manager or key worker to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition to adult care in line with the NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering identification and diagnosis).” Stefan did not have a case manager or key worker.

2. I am unable to say if the lack of a case manager or key worker caused or contributed more than minimally to Stefan’s death but had one been available they may have been able to assist Stefan and his family to navigate the services available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a difference. I am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues where there is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroner’s and Justice Act 2009 creates a duty on Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to a concern which may lead to future deaths.

3. I asked for further evidence on the provision of case managers/key workers in accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East London Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board. It is clear from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19 year olds who have both a learning disability and/or a diagnosis of autism and are at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there is a significant sudden deterioration in the community and the multi disciplinary team has not been responsive. The lowest level of service outlined in reply to the court indicated that referrals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not that they would have a key worker allocated to them. This sets the bar at a level which means a large number of young people with a learning disability and/or autism would not have a key worker nor would they be expected to have one.

4. In the evidence provided it was outlined that “Keyworkers will make sure that these children, young people and families get the right support at the right time. They will make sure that local systems are responsive to fully meeting the young people’s needs in a joined-up way and that whenever it is possible to provide care and treatment in the community with the right support this becomes the norm.” If every autistic child or young person had a key worker this would enable them or their family the opportunity to liaise with their key worker rather than having to try to navigate services themselves. This, in turn, may prevent others from encountering the issues faced by Stefan’s family and ultimately prevent future deaths.",False,True,True,False,True,False,True,False

Wade,Buckinghamshire,Corporate Director Buckingham Council Childrens Services,"On 1 March 2019 the Senior Coroner for Buckinghamshire opened an inquest into the death of Melsadie Adella-Rae Parris, a child aged 3 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest conducted by me between 14 and 30 November 2022.

The inquest found that Melsadie died from multiple injuries suffered as the result of being struck by a fast non-stopping train at Taplow Railway Station on 18 February 2019, at a time when she was being held by her adult carer who was also killed in the course of a deliberate act of self harm. The inquest concluded that the adult carer died by suicide, but Melsadie’s death was recorded by means of a narrative as hereafter appears.","Melsadie was three years old and in the custody care and control of a responsible adult. She was well cared for and loved by that adult. She was equally well cared for and loved by all her relatives. On 23 October 2018 an alert was raised by her carer that Melsadie had been assaulted, which was investigated appropriately by police and local children's social services under the provisions of the Children Act 1989, and was discounted. Melsadie remained in the custody of her carer. The social services investigation file remained open and ongoing. During the subsequent period, of not less than four months before Melsadie’s death, her carer suffered an overt breakdown in mental health such that an episodic psychosis was occasionally manifest, and intentionally concealed, and mild to moderate depression was diagnosed. On 23 December 2018 her carer exhibited symptoms of acute mental illness which was brought to the attention of the social worker team who took appropriate urgent steps to remove Melsadie from her carer and arrange a mental health assessment for the carer by qualified mental health professionals. On 29 December 2018 Melsadie’s carer was appropriately assessed by healthcare professionals and deemed not to be psychotic and to have depression. The carer was discharged from the mental health team on reasonable grounds. Melsadie was restored to that adult’s care. Thereafter her carer suffered another deterioration in mental health, the full extent of which was not known to children's social services who closed their ongoing investigation. In the course of reviewing that decision the children's social service staff undertaking the investigation were informed of an additional concern about the carer which prompted a review of Melsadie’s safety but which was considered not to justify further gathering of evidence or reference of the matter to the mental health service. An opportunity to inspect the carer’s home, and to seek evidence from the carer’s family of other signs of the carer’s developing mental illness, and to liaise with mental health services, was missed. It cannot be concluded that such an opportunity if taken would have made any difference to the outcome. The carer continued to demonstrate capacity and normal function and also provided good care to Melsadie. On 18 February 2019 the carer looked after Melsadie throughout the day with evident good intention. In the evening Melsadie went willingly with the carer to Taplow Train Station where the carer deliberately entered a prohibited area within the station by climbing over a fixed barrier and entering a disused platform through which non-stop trains passed. On the balance of probabilities the carer’s intention was to end their own life by the act of jumping into the path of a moving train, which did occur, while at the same time intentionally holding Melsadie and thereby exposing her to the same catastrophic collision with the train, which occurred simultaneously. When this happened it is not possible to determine that the carer was not suffering from such a disease of the mind as to be capable of action but incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong and was therefore likely to be legally insane.","In the course of the investigation and in evidence in the inquest I found that the social work staff in the children's services were informed on 9 January 2019 by two separate persons, [REDACTED], that the adult with daily care of Melsadie had spoken to Melsadie in terms of describing her as evil. On checking with the adult carer, that person admitted to the social worker that the reports were true. The social work team knew that the adult carer had previously been referred to them by emergency services as a result of genuine and valid concerns about the carer’s mental health such that the carer was suffering from psychosis. The team had removed Melsadie appropriately while awaiting a mental health assessment, which was completed without knowledge of the carer’s remark and before the remark was known to children’s services. The mental health assessment found that the carer was not psychotic, an opinion which was appropriate on the day of assessment. The social work team had earlier conducted an investigation around an older matter of concern involving Melsadie, but this was unrelated to the mental health of her adult carer, and it had arisen two calendar months before the mental health crisis. In respect of that initial concern the social worker had concluded reasonably that there was no evidence to justify the removal of Melsadie nor continuing concern for her safety, but for logistical reasons their file remained open at the time of the new concerns around the carer’s mental health. However the team based their review on investigations conducted some months before the mental health concerns arose and before the remark about evil was made. The team did not conduct a renewed visit to the home, nor seek up-to-date information from the family, nor liaise with the mental health team. It is likely that if they had done so they would have discovered more detail of the extent of the carer’s mental illness which was indicative of paranoia with depression, linked to concealment of ongoing episodic psychosis. It is possible that a further mental health assessment would have been sought, and arrangements made to remove Melsadie from the custody of the carer.
I found that existing guidance and policy recognised and encouraged the need to engage with family to gather information, to make home visits, to liaise with mental health and to treat assessment decisions and verification of file closure as dynamic processes requiring rigorous scrutiny.
However, despite the existence of this guidance, the team placed undue reliance on the opinion of the mental health professionals and on old irrelevant investigations. Furthermore, although the department commissioned an independent review of the case, this found that the death could not have been predicted (which I accept), but tended to emphasise perceived shortcomings in the mental health professionals' work, without acknowledging the above concerns. In addition it contained factual inaccuracies, such as a failure to identify the revelations of 9 January 2019. The review report was withheld, following complaints by the family as to matters of fact, but the council decided nonetheless to publish an executive summary which maintained the partial reflection of the review conclusions. I am concerned that by so doing the department will persist in a view that its team did not fail to adhere to its own guidance and good practice.",True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False

Rebello,Liverpool and the Wirral,North West Ambulance Service NWAS; Director of Public Health Prof. [REDACTED]; Chief Constable [REDACTED]; Police and Crime Commissioner [REDACTED],On 25 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Philip John Battle aged 73. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that: Mr Battle died by suicide,Philip John Battle lived in warden supervised sheltered accommodation. On 8 July 2022 he phoned the North West Ambulance Service at 11.20. The call indicated an overdose and self-harm by hanging. From the triage protocol then in use this was graded as a category 3 response. This should have resulted in a response within 120 minutes. An ambulance arrived at his secure flat at 15.08 and found Mr Battle had died. He had a ligature around his neck [REDACTED]. He was certified as having died at 15.10. It remains unclear as to at what time Mr Battle died.,"Evidence has been received that Philip Battle self-referred to the ambulance service stating he had taken an overdose and that he had tried to hang himself. The then triage system (medical priority dispatch) concentrated on questions relating to physical health such as his physiological function rather than assessing the actual presenting risks from poor mental health including self-inflicted fatal harm. Mr Battle lived in warden monitored sheltered accommodation and no inquiry was made about whether someone could be telephoned to check on his safety. Even if Mr Battle had not been in sheltered accommodation, it was unclear as to why there was no triage question about a phone number for a friend or relative. Evidence was given that NWAS work with Lancashire police and the health service in Blackpool with the Synergy project sharing the resources of a triage mental health car. These arrangements and relationships do not exist in Liverpool. The court was concerned about silo public health working between blue light services given the limited mental health intervention resource for NWAS was not on duty on the morning of 8 July and there was no call to Merseyside Police to see if its mental health triage car was available to intervene. Evidence was heard that these services need commissioning and there was no arrangement between Merseyside Police and the NWAS to share mental health intervention resources. This issue appears to become more important when the court heard of the plans for three mental health ambulances to be available in Merseyside and Cheshire in the near future.
The court would like the ambulance service, police and health providers to work together with the public funds at their respective disposal to develop in concert and to share community mental health crisis intervention resources for the good of the public.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Eccleston,Yorkshire West Western,"Chief Executive South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust; Commissioners for the Service; Head of Commissioning (Mental Health, Learning Disability and Autism) NHS South Yorkshire Integrated Care Board","On 14.12.21, I commenced an investigation into the death of Daniel Eric Lee aged 22. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08.11.22. The findings of the inquest were that Daniel Lee died on 16.09.21 at a disused quarry [REDACTED] by hanging with the intention to end his life.

The conclusion was suicide.

The medical cause of death was

1a Hanging",Daniel was under the care of the IHBTT team of SWYPT at the time of his death. He became known to them on 16.07.21 following an attempt to hang himself. He was seen by at least 17 different team members in at least 37 contacts during the two months of his care under the team.,"5.1 While acknowledging Daniel’s high level of contact with the IHBTT team, the evidence was that no one was taking responsibility for his care in a ‘key worker’ type role. The large number of people seeing Daniel did not make deep professional relationships with him which would allow his needs and risks to be addressed in a person centred and properly risk sensitive way. The relationships with Daniel were superficial and this infected the risk assessment process. The large number of mental health professionals in contact with Daniel inhibited him establishing deep relationships of trust.

5.2 The risk assessments themselves were therefore superficial, often relying uncritically on self-reporting without meaningfully engaging in suicide risk prevention. The initial risk assessment on first contact on 16.07.21 was flawed in that, despite the presenting context being an attempt at suicide by hanging, the risk assessment was ‘low risk of suicide’.

5.3 Daniel was a serving soldier and there was a failure to meaningfully communicate and engage with his Regiment and the medical staff attached to it.

5.4 Communication with the family was superficial and the evidence was that their perception was that they couldn’t fully share issues and concerns because of perceived barriers in information sharing. This may not have been the team’s intention, but it was the reality felt by the family. This inhibited their engagement with the team in Daniel’s best interests. The evidence of [REDACTED] was that engagement with the family was important because they were the people who knew Daniel best and who would be the first to identify any risks or concerns.

5.5 There was evidence that staff in the team struggled with decision making around information sharing. For example, on 15.09.21, the day before he died, Daniel’s girlfriend called to share concerns about his wellbeing. The person taking the call indicated that Daniel’s lack of knowledge of her referral placed the team in difficulty in sharing the information. In the event, a practitioner saw Daniel for a visit only a few minutes later and correctly identified his need for an urgent psychiatric review. Notwithstanding this, I considered that this was evidence of a failure to understand the basics of risk-based information sharing.

5.6 In summary, therefore, I considered that there was evidence that a failure to address these issues could create a risk of further deaths:

• Superficiality of risk assessments
• Lack of a key worker approach
• Lack of communication with the armed forces, army in this case
• Superficiality of communication with the family
• Anxiety about appropriate risk sharing",True,True,False,False,True,True,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 31 October 2022.

The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide.

The four questions - who, when, where and how – were answered as follows

Harry Joseph Pengelly Armstrong Evans died on 24 June 2021 at Trecarrell Mill Trebullett Launceston Cornwall by hanging [REDACTED] against a background of an acute mental health crisis","Harry was 21 years old at the date of his death, he lived in Cornwall with his parents and younger sister. He was a student at Exeter University, studying Physics and Astrophysics. At the time of his death, he was in his third year of a 3 year degree course.

Harry had no relevant medical history. He had not consulted his GP about mental health problems

Harry took exams in January 2021; his exam results can be characterised as a disastrous failure. His results leading up to those exams indicated a high performing student.

Harry subsequently chose to defer the re-takes of both his January and May 2021 exams to August 2021. A total of 6 exams. Our academic witnesses indicated this was a huge amount of work for a difficult subject.

Harry resided at university continuously from 29 December 2020 to May 2021, during which time there was little or no contact with his parents and family.

On two occasions during May 2021 Harry’s mother, [REDACTED] contacted by phone and email the University welfare services, raising concerns about Harry. [REDACTED] stated that Harry was not sharing information with the family. Due to a systems failure both of these safeguarding alerts were closed off without further action.

In late May 2021 his parents visited Harry and were concerned at his physical and mental condition. They brought Harry back to Cornwall. [REDACTED] then emailed Harry’s tutor, raising further concerns about Harry, and indicating that he was not sharing information with the family. These concerns were forwarded to Welfare Services who indicated that no information could be shared with parents without the consent of the student.

On 28 May Harry contacted his personal tutor and welfare services raising concerns about his mental health and expressly referring to the difficulties he had in communicating those concerns. He referred to the isolation that he had suffered during the pandemic and the mounting academic pressures he faced in undertaking the re-sits. These concerns were forwarded to Welfare Services who sent a number of emails to Harry inviting him to fill out an online form to access a telephone appointment.

There was no attempt to contact Harry by phone or in person by anyone at Exeter University. There was no consideration given to sharing information with Harry’s parents without his consent. There was no attempt to speak to Harry to obtain that consent.

Only after Harry’s death did his parents find out about the extent of Harry’s exam failures.","1) Training

The evidence that indicated an absence of mandatory training for academic staff on suicide prevention and mental health awareness.

The university is invited to review the provision of training for academic staff upon information sharing [see below], mental health awareness and suicide prevention.

2) Responding proactively

The evidence indicated that nobody from the university attempted to speak to or visit Harry despite numerous concerns being raised regarding his wellbeing. There was a total absence of personal engagement.

The court heard that research has consistently shown that most students and staff who experience poor mental health do not access formal support.

The university response was entirely by email and can be characterised as reactive. The evidence indicated a marked reluctance to respond flexibly and proactively to concerns.

The university is invited to review their policy as regards their response to welfare concerns and whether the current approach is sufficiently flexible and proactive. Specifically, whether there is an over-reliance on email responses and students themselves completing online application forms to access support.

3) Sharing information

The university policy allows sharing of information with consent in circumstances involving a concern for wellbeing, and without consent in exceptional circumstances. This necessarily would have involved a conversation with Harry and failing that a consideration whether exceptional circumstances applied for sharing information with his parents.

The evidence revealed a lack of staff awareness regarding university policy on information sharing. There was evidence of a misunderstanding of policy which specifically allowed the sharing of information in cases of concern, subject to discussion with Harry, and then in exceptional circumstances without his consent. Witnesses referred to a blanket ban on sharing or alternatively to sharing only if they perceived imminent risk to life.

The evidence indicated that there was insufficient consideration given to notifying Harry’s parents of the extent of his exam failure, in order to fully mobilise Harry’s support network. There was no evidence of the ‘Think Family’ approach adopted by the university following previous suicides.

The university is invited to review the thresholds for sharing information and staff awareness of those thresholds, and the implementation and understanding across academic and welfare staff of the Think Family approach.

4) Pastoral support

The evidence indicated that if Harry’s pastoral tutor had known Harry’s mobile number, he may have called him. The court heard that there was no policy for pastoral tutors exchanging mobile numbers with students.

The university is invited to review whether pastoral tutors should offer to exchange mobile numbers with their students, and to consider whether pastoral tutors should have a work mobile to facilitate a proactive approach in the event that there are concerns for wellbeing.

Max’s father also tried to call her, with the same result. Just over a week after Max’s death, his family received a letter addressed to him from Kent Social Services, explaining that his social worker was off sick.

Lewis,Liverpool and the Wirral,Chief Executive of Cheshire Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,"On 17 April 2018 an investigation was commenced into the death of Katharine Mary Tyrer aged 44. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 September 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Suicide - Missed opportunities between the hours of 11.00 am and 12.00 noon, an underestimation of the risk Katharine Mary Tyrer posed to herself. Compounded by inadequate risk assessment process and ward layout.","On 3 April 2018 the Deceased (‘Katharine’) was transferred to the Lakefield Ward at Clatterbridge Hospital from Aintree Hospital, to which she had been admitted on 28 March 2018 after suffering multiple spinal fractures when she jumped from height into the River Mersey in an attempt to kill herself. She was a detained patient under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act.
Katharine was well known to the clinical staff on the Lakefield Ward, having been admitted as both a detained patient and on a voluntary basis on a number of previous occasions, typically following impulsive episodes of self-harm or actions consistent with attempts to take her own life. It was known that these occurrences would often follow a ‘trigger event’, notably including disagreements with her husband. Her diagnosis at the time was emotionally unstable personality disorder, for which she was being treated appropriately, in line with national guidance. In the past she had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, but this was dropped as a secondary diagnosis in 2016.
On 6 April 2018 Katharine was moved from a room on the main corridor of the Lakefield Ward to one tucked away, further from ward staff.
On 11 April Katharine asked for her level of observations to be reduced. They were, from L2 to L1. Later the same day she reported feeling emotional and increasingly impulsive.
On 12 April 2018 she left the ward at 10:07 to meet her husband outside. They argued and the meeting was cut short. He rang ward staff to inform them about what had happened and that she was returning. Katharine arrived back at 10:25 and, prompted by the call, a Clinical Support Worker visited Katharine’s room and found her crying and upset. PRN medication was offered and accepted; and given at 10:40 by a nurse. Katharine was then left alone but shortly afterwards pressed her alarm bell to request assistance with her back brace. Four ward staff attended and helped, but had left again by 10:55. They had no concerns, despite Katharine reporting that she felt sickly. A different member of staff saw her on the hourly observation round at 11:00.
Katharine was not seen again until 12:00, when a Trainee Nursing Assistant performing the hourly observation round found her unresponsive in her bathroom, with a ligature [REDACTED]. Despite prompt CPR and 25 minutes of Advance Life Support she died at the scene.
The Trust’s RCA found that (inter alia) documentation around risk assessment and care planning fell short of expectations. A Trust witness explained that improvements have been made in those respects since Katharine’s death. The court’s independent expert considered the ward layout ‘wholly inadequate’.
The jury found that Katharine had committed suicide, but concluded that missed opportunities to affect the outcome between 11:00 and 12:00 on 12 April 2022, as well as an under-estimation of the risk Katharine posed to herself, had contributed more than minimally to her death, as had the ward layout and inadequate risk assessment.","1. The ward layout did not lend itself to easy observation of patients. The court’s expert considered it ‘wholly inadequate’. The jury felt that this contributed more than minimally to Katharine’s death.

A number of rooms (including Katharine’s room, 23) were remote from the nursing station and largely out of sight unless visited for a specific purpose. Whilst I am aware that some changes have been made since 2018, I am concerned that the current layout continues to place vulnerable patients, who might take their own lives, at risk.

It is appreciated that the trust might not be in a position to create a ward which eliminates all of the layout issues. However, mitigation measures might be appropriate if the present facilities are to be used on an ongoing basis in an unmodified form. I am concerned that the limitations presented by the current layout may mean that staffing levels need to be adjusted to allow for greater levels of informal observation, oversight and monitoring.

2. The argument with her husband was a trigger event for Katharine. She was seen briefly by some ward staff between her return to the ward at around 10:25 and 11:00, but left completely unattended between 11:00-12:00. The jury felt that there was a missed opportunity at this time to affect the outcome and that the assessment of the risk that Katharine posed to herself had been inadequate.

The evidence indicated that ward staff (seemingly regardless of their level of experience and seniority) who attend a patient in a situation like this are left to determine what (if any) action to take based upon their clinical judgement. In particular, it is left to the individual to decide whether escalation to a senior clinician would be appropriate and whether observations or monitoring (or even simply staying with the patient) should be increased for a period of time.

I was told that it would not be unworkable in any scenario such as this (involving knowledge of a trigger event in the case of an impulsive patient with a known history of suicide attempts and self-harm) for there to be a procedure which called for an automatic review by the senior clinician on the ward at the time. However, that is not the current situation. I am concerned that, in the absence of a clear protocol, relatively junior staff (who may not be able to effect an adequate risk assessment) may not be equipped to determine how best to address the short-term risk.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Combes,Yorkshire South West,Cygnet Health Care; NHS England,"On 19 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney born on 11 September 2003. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which commenced on 7 March 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was:-

On the 10th of April 2021 in Cygnet Hospital, Sheffield, Chelsea Blue Louise Mooney performed an act of self-harm by tying 2 non-fixed ligatures. As a result of insufficient care, crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response, this led to her unexpected death two days later on the 12th of April in the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.

There was also a jury questionnaire which was completed and is appended to this Regulation 28 report for information.

The medical cause of death was:

1a: Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy","It is clear from the evidence that was heard during the inquest that Chelsea initially developed a type of eating disorder that required support. She was admitted to a number of mental health inpatient units leading to her admission to Cygnet in Sheffield.

Whilst in this facility a number of material things happened:-

1. Chelsea began to self-harm using ligatures which was a new behaviour
2. Chelsea's working diagnosis became PTSD
3. Chelsea made a number of allegations of abuse by members of her family and others which required investigating
4. Chelsea declined to share information with her family

Chelsea's family were advised that young people are not given a fixed diagnosis and that the working diagnosis was PTSD. Chelsea's family were keen to explore a diagnosis of autism however despite there not being a fixed diagnosis for Chelsea this was not explored by the treating team and Chelsea's diagnosis of PTSD does not appear to have been routinely reviewed through her admission. To be clear; I mean that her diagnosis was not reviewed, not that her treatment and plans were not reviewed. There also seems to have been a move away from a diagnosis of an eating disorder and following the inquest I am not clear that I understand the rationale for this other than PTSD appeared to be a better 'fit' for Chelsea's symptoms.

Ligatures

Chelsea started to use ligatures in Cygnet having not done so previously. Again, this does not appear to have been a cause of significant concern and appears to be the norm within Chelsea's peer cohort. There was one particular issue for Chelsea however which came to light during the inquest which was that male members of staff felt concerned about interacting with Chelsea alone: even where that delayed support in risky situations.

Engagement with Chelsea's Family

I heard evidence that there came a time when Chelsea did not which for her parents to be aware of what was happening in Cygnet or have any information about her health and that she had capacity to make this decision. I have subsequently received the Capacity Assessment that supports this view. I also heard in evidence that the Capacity Assessment ought to have been revisited and that there were circumstances when a patient's wishes could not be respected. This was particularly relevant to Chelsea's mother having limited information and then supporting her on s17 leave. I also heard that Chelsea was supported by a legal advisor for the purposes of her detention under the Mental Health Act.

I also heard no evidence that her age was considered and whether or not she was competent to make this decision even if she had capacity. Chelsea was 17 at the time of her death; this required careful exploration with her and there was no evidence of this.

Emergency Response on the Day of the Final Ligature Incident

I heard evidence that the check on Chelsea was delayed due to another emergency on the unit, namely the tying of a ligature by another individual. I also heard evidence that the timing of Chelsea's checks were not in accordance with recognised policy and ought perhaps to have prompted a different review and approval process (although the timings were appropriate and designed to keep Chelsea safe).

I heard evidence, and the jury expressly accepted, that the alarm being pulled for the other patient using a ligature would be heard by Chelsea and was a relevant factor in her ligature event.

I then heard that when she was checked the member of staff who checked on her would not lay hands on her as he was a male member of staff alone in the room and was worried about repercussions. He therefore sought support from a female member of staff who went to check on Chelsea and realised that she was not conscious. She then shouted for help and a ligature knife. There were then further delays as others came to observe Chelsea, collected the ligature knife, and removed the ligature then commenced CPR with the red bag. The jury found that these delays were unreasonable in the circumstances. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence about the co-ordination of CPR was that every member of staff present believed one individual was leading the CPR response; however, that particular individual was not aware of that. Whilst this did not materially change the CPR in this case it was certainly not indicative of a well-rehearsed and practised response to an emergency situation.","1. The diagnosis whilst described as not being fixed; was not adequately reviewed. The primary witness for Cygnet in relation to diagnosis lacked professional curiosity even when asked questions in evidence. For example dismissing the potential that Chelsea may be hyperbolic in some of her descriptions of incidents and could that be relevant to diagnosis or treatment; evidence from the family about another member of the family with an autism diagnosis was not followed up (the evidence from Cygnet being that they had not been aware the family wished to explore this); nonetheless in evidence it was dismissed as a possibility.
2. Whilst it is important that the young person is believed and has confidence in those with a therapeutic relationship that she will be believed when she makes disclosures; there was almost no professional curiosity about the allegations and whether they spoke to something else going on with Chelsea. The allegations that were made were blindly accepted by the team and one example where this was problematic is that part of Chelsea's PTSD diagnosis was based on flashbacks. One of the flashbacks which she described related to finding her aunt dead. Her aunt was not dead and in fact attended the inquest proceedings however this had not been clarified with the family and the treating team accepted this information from Chelsea unequivocally. It is clear there is a very fine balance to tread as it is clear that Chelsea was suffering from flashbacks and had suffered trauma, there was no demonstrable exploration of this.
3. The decision not to share information with family was made based on one capacity assessment. This did not fully address the issues with Chelsea of understanding the consequences of that decision and neither does it adequately break down the information which Cygnet may wish to share with family. This appears to have been a blanket decision and once a capacity assessment determined that Chelsea had the capacity to make that decision there is not evidence available to me of conversations with Chelsea to establish exactly what she would and would not share with family and that the consequences of those decisions were adequately explored with her. I would have expected, at Chelsea's age, that a social worker would be involved in supporting her with this decision and reviewing it regularly. This decision about her capacity and information sharing were also not revisited which they ought to have been regularly. Not least because Chelsea's mother was responsible for supporting her with s17 leave and was entitled to fully understand the risks to Chelsea or herself through this.
4. There was no evidence of debrief after prior incidents of ligatures or other self-harm attempts and therefore crucial information about Chelsea's state of mind, motivation and methods was missing from future planning and risk assessments.
5. There was limited concern about the number of ligature incidents collectively across the ward. They appear to have been accepted as normal behaviour. There was no record of Chelsea using ligatures prior to her admission onto this ward. This reality for staff appears to have led to a downgrading of the seriousness of the use of ligatures. With staff describing in evidence when they would and would not intervene and what would and would not constitute a serious incident in relation to ligatures (i.e., a hospital admission would be required before it was regarded as a serious incident requiring immediate changes to risk levels and observations). It may be that this approach to ligatures also contributed to the delay in Chelsea's final ligature being removed.
6. Male staff were nervous and uncertain of how to approach Chelsea when they were alone. Clear guidance needed to be made available to them on how to deal with this. Although in evidence staff said that if there was an emergency they would attend even if alone this was not the case in practice as the male member of staff sought female support before recognising that Chelsea was in crisis.
7. The approach of three members of staff checking Chelsea before the ligature knife was brought and used led to avoidable delay. I am aware from the evidence that there are practice exercises involving the 'Red Bag' however I am not clear that the same is practised in relation to the check, identification of a ligature and obtaining and using the ligature knife in these situations.
8. Whilst in evidence I have heard about the practice exercises using the 'Red Bag' it is clear that there was limited confidence and clarity around the CPR needed for Chelsea. There was not a clear structure of one person leading and others knowing exactly what and how to do tasks.
9. There were opportunities for commissioners to support Cygnet earlier when case managing Chelsea's package of care. The new behaviour of using ligatures should have invited professional curiosity from commissioners who should have sought assurance about the overall practice of ligature use and intervention from Cygnet but also what that meant specifically for Chelsea and how Cygnet were keeping her safe. This may have led to a review by Cygnet and a better understanding of Chelsea's ligature use.
10. Commissioners also ought to have spoken to Chelsea themselves and assured themselves about the decision not to share information with her family; particularly her mother who had been a huge support for Chelsea prior to Covid-19. The impact of the cessation of face-to-face visits on anyone detained under the Mental Health Act, but particularly young people like Chelsea appears to have been underestimated.",True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True

Murray,Greater Manchester South,"The Chief Executive, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust","On 5 August 2020, the Coroner opened an inquest into the death of Susan Mary Regan. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 27 April 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative form of conclusion of suicide contributed to by a failure by Mental Health Services to recognise her deteriorating mental health and the increased risk she presented and to take effective steps to reduce the risk.","Susan Regan was a 61 year old lady who had no relevant past mental health medical history. She was a long serving, well thought of, member of staff at Marks and Spencer. Her husband [REDACTED] died in 2017 and this did understandably affect her but save for some minor characteristic anxiety she had no recorded mental health issues. Following furlough from her role at Marks and Spencer, she began to deteriorate in terms of her mental health and her general wellbeing. She became malnourished and dehydrated combined with increasingly disturbed behaviour consistent with anxiety, arguably displaying potential psychotic tendencies and evidence of self-harm. This resulted in a consultation with the G.P. on 12 June 2020, involvement of The Mental Health Access Team on 5 June 2020, the appointment of The Home Based Treatment Team followed by admission to Stepping Hill Hospital in respect of the poor state of her mental and physical health, on 11 June 2020, followed by an assessment under the Mental Health Act on 14 June 2020 resulting in admission to a Mental Health Ward under section 2 of The Mental Health Act. Following improvement in her condition, the section was rescinded on 23 June 2020 and Mrs Regan was discharged home with continuing support from The Home Based Treatment Team. There were ongoing symptoms and matters reached a head on 23 July 2020 when Mrs Regan was reported to be at the end of her drive, screaming.

Advice was sought and a visit planned for 24 July 2020 at which Mrs Regan was described as anxious, very agitated and rubbing her hands and face. Throughout a series of assessments over the months Mrs Regan would either deny suicidal ideation or avoid answering the questions. She was known to not want to be hospitalised but her sons remained concerned that she be kept safe. Crucially, they were not consulted on this point 24 July 2020 contrary to the specific instructions of a doctor when she was consulted on 24 July 2020. There was a failure to have a discussion with Mrs Regan's sons about their opinions on hospitalisation and the risks of not doing so. There was a further failure to record any reference to hospitalisation in their notes following the visit on the morning of 24 July 2020. Mrs Regan's dosage of diazepam was doubled and there appeared to be some improvement in her level of anxiety. A planned visit took place on the morning of 25 July 2020. Later that afternoon Mrs Regan took her own life by [REDACTED] as a ligature, around the neck, in [REDACTED] her home address.","1) During the course of the inquest evidence emerged that the clinical guidance of a doctor required the Home Treatment Team to speak to Ms Regan's sons to explore whether they feel she needed to be admitted on an inpatient psychiatric unit. Admission to also be considered if Ms Regan would continue to show non-compliance on her medications. Such an enquiry was not undertaken.

2) It was also confirmed in evidence that there was a failure to properly record a plan and properly communicate such a plan with Mrs Regan’s sons.",True,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

Zsolt Kirjak was found to have ended his life following a succession of emergency presentations for persistent ENT symptoms and associated psychological distress including acute suicidal thoughts.

2.

Correspondingly, there was an insufficient risk assessment that did not include or appraise the patient’s risk factors for suicide. The treatment plan prescribed did not manage the patient’s risks.

3. There was a lack of enquiry by any of the clinicians who had seen the patient into the patient’s previous attempt to give himself a stroke and a subsequently acquired eye injury. It is very unusual for a patient to attempt to give oneself a stroke and would reasonably be expected to warrant a detailed assessment because it implies a high degree of harm and lethality.

On 3/3/21 Mr Nixon was found suspended by a ligature in wooded grounds in North Dorset.,"1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. Mr Nixon was not known to mental health services prior to February 2021.

ii. Mr Nixon’s [REDACTED] accompanied him to every appointment he had with the Home Treatment Team. She had never had dealings with the Mental Health Services previously.

iii. Mr Nixon had given permission to the Mental Health Services to share information with [REDACTED]. On one occasion it was deemed that a doctor could not impart patient information to Mr Nixon’s [REDACTED] because he wrongly thought he did not have permission from the patient to do so.

iv. Mr Nixon’s [REDACTED] was unaware that he had disclosed “occasional suicidal thoughts” and was therefore unable to assess the risk of Mr Nixon to himself and accordingly did not take any steps to protect him.

v. The Care Plan, Escalation Plan, Emergency Plan were not drawn up in writing until after Mr Nixon’s death. No paperwork was sent to Mr Nixon (and in turn not seen by his partner) by the Home Treatment Team prior to his death. Mr Nixon’s partner was not therefore party to or privy to any risk assessment.

vi. A Carer’s Assessment was considered but thought not appropriate as it was believed that Mr Nixon’s [REDACTED] (who was present at all consultations with the Home Treatment Team) was part of what was seen as “an intelligent and resourceful couple”.

vii. The Trust has a patient information leaflet describing what support and advice can be given to a carer. There is a Carer Assessment tool available.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. The failure to ensure that family members/carers are fully involved from the outset in the risk assessment process and that they have a full comprehension of steps being taken and/or decisions being made. I believe the Trust should take a more proactive approach.

ii. There should be criteria to be applied as to who should be considered for a Carer’s Assessment at the earliest appointment with the Home Treatment Team. Such criteria should include whether the patient has given permission to share information; whether the patient and/or the carer have been involved with mental health services previously; whether the carer has been/will be present during consultations; the level of understanding of the carer in relation to steps taken and decisions made and whether they need further help.

iii. Such criteria may lead to a full carer’s assessment. It is noted that there will always be a delay between assessments and the drawing up of care plans etc which will then be sent out to the patient. By establishing an early process of engaging with carers the medical professionals may build in further protective factors for the patient.",True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.","Robert Arthur Brown had a history of attempts to take his own life and of suicidal ideation. He was under the treatment of a mental health trust during 2020.

Mr Brown was assessed as being at high risk of suicide on 3 September 2020. He reluctantly agreed to an admission as a voluntary patient to hospital. At this time, the family and Crisis Team could not keep Mr Brown safe in the community. His wife was known to be his carer and had taken responsibility for Mr Brown’s medication.

He indicated that he no longer had suicidal thoughts and appeared to have made plans as to the changes that he was going to make which differed from those previously. He was assessed by the clinicians for discharge, and this was agreed.

Mr Brown’s wife was not contacted and advised that he would be discharged. Mrs Brown only became aware of this when Mr Brown was in transit back to his home address. The evidence from the clinicians was that Mr Brown had capacity and did not want them to contact Mrs Brown and that he would make her aware of his discharge. The instruction by Mr Brown not to inform Mrs Brown was not documented and the oral evidence from KMPT witnesses was that they could not inform Mrs Brown as this would be contrary to Mr Brown’s wishes.

The medical cause of death given was:

1a. Suspension

I determined that on 16 June 2021 Matthew John Evans was found deceased at [REDACTED], Folly Hill, having [REDACTED][REDACTED][REDACTED] with the intention of ending his life.","Matthew was a 47-year-old man who worked in IT and was fit and well with no underlying medical or mental health difficulties. On or around December 2020, despite coping well with the 2 previous Covid-19 lockdowns he began catastrophising and developed insomnia through the third lockdown. This worsened and he sought help from his General Practitioner in April 2021.

Matthew sent an email regarding his insomnia to his GP who thereafter had a telephone consultation on 14 April 2021, referring Matthew for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for insomnia.

Matthew had CBT with TalkPlus between April and July 2022. His initial depression and anxiety (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) scores were in the severe range and had deteriorated further when recalculated at the end of the sessions. In May 2021, he indicated a suicide risk of 5/10 and 4/10 on the final session. His suicide risk was discussed with other practitioners but referral to further mental health care was not considered warranted. After his last session Matthew was recommended to have a more intensive course of CBT which had not commenced at the time of his death.

TalkPlus sent a letter to the GP outlining the care to be offered to Matthew and thereafter a follow up letter indicating the care they had provided. Both these letters indicated Matthew was suffering from insomnia, anxiety and depression with the severe PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores.

Matthew had further telephone consultations, with his GP on 27 May, 2 and 9 June 2021 all of which were initiated by him via email. His request for sleeping medication was initially refused but after a further request he was prescribed Zopiclone. On 9 June 2021 he was prescribed Mirtazapine for ongoing anxiety, depression and insomnia. On 16 June 2021 he ended his life.","The GP was not sufficiently proactive with multiple lost opportunities to provide better care and support for Matthew. The GP did not undertake a mental health assessment to assess the severity of Matthew’s difficulties and to ascertain whether further support or referral to secondary mental health care were indicated in any of the four telephone consultations. He did not ask or document at any time if Matthew had any suicidal ideation or acts of self-harm. The GP did not offer a face-to-face consultation or arrange a follow up appointment. The GP declined to prescribe Zopiclone and whilst he referred Matthew to the benefits of Melatonin he did not offer a prescription. He prescribed Mirtazapine having not done so before for someone in Matthew’s position on a background of having no post graduate qualifications in mental health. Furthermore, he did not document any warning of the possible side-effects of this drug including the possible increased risk of suicidal ideation with commencing the drug. It is unclear whether the GP had read the letters from TalkPlus. He did not ask permission as to whether it was possible to inform or involve Matthew’s partner and family in his on-going care.

Combes,Yorkshire South West,Sheffield Health and Social Care Trust; Ministry of Justice,"On 9 September 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Marjorie Grayson born on 4 March 1935. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which commenced on 27 January 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was:-

On 3 September 2020 Marjorie Grayson [REDACTED] at her property [REDACTED] Sheffield resulting in her death. At the time of her death she was in contact with Mental Health services and had been identified as low risk of causing harm to herself. She [REDACTED] with the intention of effecting her death and knowing this was very likely to be the result. And the conclusion recorded was suicide.

The medical cause of death was:

1a: Blunt force head trauma","On 13 September 2018 Marjorie Grayson stabbed her husband four times resulting in his death

On 3 September 2020 Marjorie had moved back into her home address. She climbed out of her bedroom window on the first floor of her property and fell from the window.

I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Marjorie was complaining of low mood. That she had returned to her home address which was the scene of the index offence and that she felt guilty about what she had put her family through; she was suffering from thoughts which might had led her to wish to end her own life. Her mood had not improved throughout her treatment and as a result of that I am content, on the balance of probabilities, that Marjorie intended to end her life and took the necessary steps to make this happen by [REDACTED]. I therefore will return a conclusion of suicide in this case.","1. The clinical evidence which the Ministry of Justice obtained in Mrs Grayson's criminal proceedings was very clear of two things (a) Mrs Grayson should not return home alone as she was likely to have deteriorated whilst in prison and care and she had expressed suicidal or self-harm related thoughts and (b) she should not be returned to the care of her family because, as unlikely as it may sound, she posed a continued risk to her family.

2. The Ministry of Justice evidence further asserted that there was no requirement for a s41 Order because there was no risk to the public.
Unfortunately, the two things expressed in the Ministry of Justice evidence, namely that Mrs Grayson should not return home alone to care for herself and that she should not be returned to the care of her family is exactly the approach that was taken with Mrs Grayson with the result being Mrs Grayson's death.

4. I am unclear why members of Mrs Grayson's family, who do not reside with her ordinarily and at the time of her offending, are not regarded as members of the public for the purposes of a s41 Order. The risk of harm to them was clear in the mind of the author and had they been regarded as members of the public this may have led to a s41 Order being made which, although potentially making no difference in this case may do in others.

5. Sheffield Health and Social Care Trust determined to do with Mrs Grayson upon discharge did not pay sufficient heed to the clinical evidence obtained by the Ministry of Justice and which was reflected in the practice at St Andrew's. Sheffield Health and Social Care Trust do not seem to have joined up the actions that were recommended from the Criminal Justice proceedings and the work undertaken at St Andrew's resulting in a discharge which did not adequately reflect the risks to and from Mrs Grayson.

6. Sheffield Health and Social Care Trust did not have risk assessments which supported adequate communication with Mrs Grayson herself and instead placed an overburden on her family to advocate for her

Ms Hedges remained under the care of the Home Based Treatment Team following a house move on 5 November 2020. After this point in time family members considered Ms Hedges to seem low in mood and withdrawn.

1. The court heard evidence that the Trust’s Psychological Therapy service used (and continues to use) a different computerised record-keeping system from that used by staff providing acute mental health services, which the latter staff group do not necessarily have access to. It is a matter of concern that this approach means staff undertaking risk assessments and formulating care plans may on occasion be doing so without access to all relevant information. This was certainly true in Ms Hedges’s case.

2. It is also a matter of concern that, following disclosure by Ms Hedges at a multidisciplinary meeting of a serious allegation to the effect that she was touched inappropriately by another patient, the Trust’s own safeguarding policy was not followed.

To the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care

1. The court heard evidence to the effect that Ms Hedges often found the environment of a (mixed-sex) mental health ward distressing and difficult, both as a result of her illness and the ongoing effects of traumatic experiences endured at various stages of her life.

It is a matter of concern that modern mental health service design and provision is not consistently or sufficiently trauma-informed, with services being delivered to people such as Ms Hedges who have experienced trauma in a way which is likely to cause a patient to feel unsafe and excluded, thus undermining goals for treatment.",True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

I found that the cause of death was:

I a Blunt chest and abdominal trauma

I concluded with a narrative conclusion as follows:

Melanie Jane Elms was an informal patient at the Abraham Cowley Unit and had a history of schizo-affective disorder and of suicidal attempts. On 30 January 2018 she requested day leave from the unit for part of the day. A mandatory risk assessment which should have been undertaken by a nurse before Melanie left the unit was not carried out and consequently she was permitted to leave the unit without her mental state being assessed and therefore was unclear. There was a failure by the unit to record, consider and thereafter act upon concerns made to it by her husband regarding Melanie’s welfare during the day. At about 20.37, Melanie entered [REDACTED]. After a short period spent on the [REDACTED] [REDACTED] whereupon she deliberately [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. As a result she suffered fatal injuries that led to her death. Whilst her intention at the time of the event is unclear her mental health condition materially contributed to her death.

I adjourned consideration of whether to write a report for the prevention of future deaths for further evidence to be provided.","i.) Melanie struggled with significant mental health problems including schizo-affective disorder, alcohol addiction, depression and severe post-natal depression. Melanie had several admissions under the Mental Health Act 1983. She was married with one son.

ii.) On 21 July 2017 she was discharged from a two and a half year admission under the Mental Health Act 1983. Between 21 July and 24 July 2017 she was discharged to a crisis house.

iii.) Her treating doctor had created a care package to allow Melanie to cope in the community. It included carers visiting Melanie every day. However, until they were able to start a short term arrangement was made. The proper package of care was never put in place.

iv.) Between July 2017 and December 2017 Melanie and her family struggled with her return to the community and the limited package of care.

v.) Her husband struggled to support Melanie on the limited package of care she was receiving. He made numerous calls to CMHRS asking for more support and more care particularly because Children Services’ concerns remained.

vi.) On 2 October after Melanie had been assessed by the HTT having committed self-harm with suicidal intentions which she later denied, she was found a crisis house and Martyn asked for her to be allowed to stay longer but was told no. On 26 October Melanie with some insight asked to return to the crisis house.

vii.) As things unravelled for Melanie, on 9 December 2017 her husband and son returned to the family home to find it filled with black smoke. Fire services attended and found Melanie asleep upstairs and refusing to leave. She was responsible for starting the fire by putting cigarettes into the sink pipes. It is not clear if she knew what she was doing.

viii.) As a result of this incident, Melanie was admitted to Blake Ward, ACU as an informal patient.

ix.) Due to the seriousness of the incidents in the family home some of which were in front of her son, and that the final incident had rendered the family home unliveable until made safe and refurbished, Children’s Services required stronger measures in place to protect [REDACTED]. These included a Non-Molestation Order and Occupation Order.

x.) On 22 December 2017 Melanie’s treating doctor was changed to someone who did not have a detailed knowledge of her last admission.

xi.) As an informal patient, Melanie was allowed leave unrestricted. There seemed from the evidence at that time to be a culture that informal patients were not challenged about leave and therefore although there were some checks that were in place were not being performed as rigorously as they could have been. The “walk book” the record of those on leave from the ward is a sparse document and no recording of risk is made on the face of it. This along with a number of other things has been changed subsequent to Melanie’s death.

xii.) On 15 December Melanie had leave and she had been expected back at 18.25. By 2200 the ward staff started to call Melanie’s phone and her husband’s phone. Her husband had not been notified of her leave. She was found at 2300 to have returned to the fire-damaged home address intoxicated and distressed and she reported to her husband that she was having a miscarriage and was bleeding. Ambulance and police attended and Melanie was found to have wound. Melanie was returned via A&E to Blake Ward. There were reports that she had smashed things in the house. Melanie was not pregnant and had not been.

xiii.) Between the 16 and 19 December nurses were concerned she would abscond and used their temporary holding powers to stop her leaving.

xiv.) On 19 December she used her leave at around 1330. The ward received a telephone call that Melanie was in the local pub and was behaving bizarrely. Staff had to retrieve her from the pub.

xv.) She had leave between 22 and 24 December without incident.

xvi.) On 29 December Melanie used leave and did not return on time, concerns were raised at 2200 and she was classified as a missing person. The ward received a telephone call from A&E where Melanie had gone because she was concerned she was having a miscarriage. Melanie was not pregnant and had not been.

xvii.) Melanie had two further periods of leave which went without incident.

xviii.) On 10 January 2018 – a Child Protection Meeting about her son was convened and Melanie did not attend but was very distressed and angry about it. She used leave at 1300 and stayed out half an hour beyond the expected time intoxicated.

xix.) On 13 January she used leave for an hour without any incidents On 16 January 2018- she used leave and called the ward to say she would be late. She had attended the temporary accommodation where her family were staying. Melanie was alleged to have broken glass and assaulted police officers and she was taken into police custody. Melanie was bailed and returned to the ward on 17.

xx.) On 19 January and 21 January – she used leave without incident. On 22 January Melanie went out early and did not return until 2100. On 23 January she went out several times, no issues On 25 January- Melanie went on leave and returned smelling of alcohol and was abusive to staff

xxi.) On 26 January- her husband called the ward because Melanie was expressing suicidal intentions. On 27 January- although described as agitated and erratic, she used leave without issues On 28 January- she used leave and was irritable and aggressive on return. On 29 January she used leave no issues

xxii.) On one of the leaves, not clear which one, Melanie was wandering in Ottershaw and was found in the dark by a mechanic who helped her to return to the ward.

xxiii.) On 30 January 2018 Melanie was RAG rated green. This has been explained as a traffic light system of risk which is given to each patient daily. The ward was very busy and her allocated nurse was unable to go through Melanie’s care plan with her. The ward was also reliant on agency nurses: they were qualified to do the work but were not allowed access to the computer recording system for putting notes onto the system.

xxiv.) Melanie went on leave at some point during the day shift. The only recording of this in the notes is retrospectively. The walk book which is a handwritten document filled in by the nurse who is signing any person out of the ward and which should include details of when the person is expected back and what they were wearing so that a missing person report can be filed with the police if any when necessary.

xxv.) However, on the 30 January 2018 no risk assessment was undertaken of Melanie before she left the ward. There is no walk book for her and no trace of the nurse who granted her leave on that day.

xxvi.) What is known about 30 January 2018: Melanie went to the Sainsburys in Chertsey and rang her husband to tell him that she couldn’t get back to the ward and that she felt weird. She did not describe or explain how. It was unclear why she couldn’t get back as it was a short walk away. She was asking to be picked up. Her husband was not able to pick her up due to commitments to their son and because of how he had been advised to handle Melanie’s requests. This was at about 16.30.

xxvii.) Melanie’s husband called the ward just after this call. The Systmone notes written retrospectively on 31 refer to a call at 20.30 from her husband. An agency nurse took the call but the notes about it were entered by the allocated nurse from what she had overheard.

xxviii.) Melanie’s husband called again around 20.00 and this is supported by the retrospective entry although that is timed as being at 20.30 but is not a contemporaneous record. By this time the night shift staff were on duty and Melanie had still not returned. Her husband was concerned that she had been a short walk away from the facility at 16.30 wanting to return and 3 1/2 hours later had not returned.

xxix.) At about 20.00 her husband received a telephone call from his local gym where both he and Melanie were regular members. Melanie had asked the gym to use the phone and she had called Melanie’s husband. Melanie said she was trying to find her mum and couldn’t find her. Melanie’s mum lived in a house in Thames Ditton. Melanie’s husband tried to ascertain if Melanie had been drinking and where she had been since her last call. She became impatient and handed the phone back to the gym receptionist who stated that Melanie was saying she was going to get a taxi and no longer wanted a lift. Melanie’s husband telephoned the ward again to say where she was and what had happened.

xxx.) Melanie’s husband was concerned about Melanie and thought given the mention of her mum that Melanie might have been at her mum’s. He called her mum but Melanie was not there and had not been in touch and her mum was angry and refused to go to the end of the road to look for Melanie.

xxxi.) Melanie’s mum told her son who lived with her about the call and they made a plan with Melanie’s husband about where to search for her and began looking for her.

xxxii.) A train driver was driving the 20.54 Hampton Court to Waterloo train with headcode [REDACTED] and it had left Hampton Court station to begin its journey. It was clear dark dry evening. The train had conducted a running brake test just after leaving Hampton Court station. The journey between Hampton Court station and Thames Ditton Station was about two minutes. The train had not yet reached the far end of the station platform known as the country end so no part of the train was yet adjacent to the platform. The train driver described seeing a woman [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. As soon as he saw her he applied the emergency brakes. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED].

xxxiii.) There was not enough time for the train to stop. The train struck the woman, who was later identified via fingerprints as Melanie, and her body came to rest under the second or third carriage of the train. ROLE was declared at 21.30 by a paramedic.

xxxiv.) Among her belongings some notes were found that seem to be addressed to her son. These notes do not look as if they were written all at the same time. They cannot be classified as suicide notes and do not disclose an intention to commit suicide. They do show a distressed state of mind.

xxxv.) From what can be ascertained from toxicology results she had in her system some of her therapeutic medications at a therapeutic dose. She also had a blood alcohol of 68 ml/dL this is a low concentration and she would not have been likely to have been intoxicated on this concentration, particularly given her tolerance to alcohol. However, the toxicologist is also unable to say if there had been an excess ingestion of drugs due to the effect of rapid death. There is no evidence that Melanie was under the influence of drugs or that she had ingested a larger quantity than her usual therapeutic dose as dispensed at the ACU.","1. The care package arranged for Melanie following discharge from lengthy in-patient admission was not followed and was altered to something which the treating doctor did not consider adequate.

2. The walk book was not properly completed.

3. There was no extra planning for changes in circumstances: Melanie faced never being allowed to return to family life with her husband and son due to Child In Need proceedings; changes in medication and less support from family due to the Social Services requirements.

4. There was no missing person plan in place with timeframe and steps of escalation for Melanie’s leave.

5. Risk assessment prior to leave was not adequate.

6. Risk assessment prior to leave was not recorded.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

In July and August 2020, whilst an in-patient at Whipps Cross Hospital and whilst under enhanced (1:1 care), Mr Gadhavi carried out a number of self-harming acts. These included overdoses and an attempt to jump from a hospital bridge. On one occasion in August 2020, the member of staff allocated to provide 1:1 care to him, was found to be sleeping. In September 2020, Mr Gadhavi required admission to Whipps Cross Hospital again. There was no alert on his medical records to alert staff to the need for a risk assessment and risk management plan. Fortuitously, he was recognised by a member of staff who had cared for him previously and enhanced care was put in place. Unfortunately, there were a number of breaches of the enhanced care policy. Mr Gadhavi was able to take a fatal overdose of medication whilst he was an in-patient on the ward.","1. Datix reports were generated for the multiple self-harming incidents in July and August 2020.

Horstead,Essex,Chief Executive Officer of Essex Partnership NHS Trust; Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust,"On 6 August 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Stephanie Moyce, aged 55 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 February 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was one of suicide, with a medical cause of death of ‘1a Fatal pressure on neck’.","Ms Moyce, a Registered Mental Nurse with 25 years’ experience working for EPUT as an RMN before retiring in 2010, had a lengthy history of mental health issues with episodes of depression from 1990 and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in December 2006; she also had a history of alcohol misuse.

Ms Moyce had a documented history of repeated drug overdoses dating back to 2000 and in the seven years or so preceding her death (and prior to that) she had been hospitalised following impulsive suicide attempts including: an overdose of prescription medication leading to hospitalisation for a week in 2015; cutting her throat and wrists requiring multiple stitches in 2018; repeated attempts to hang herself over the course of a weekend in 2019. She was last detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 in October 2014 and had been subject to Section 117 MHA after care since then, under the care of the Essex University Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT). Ms Moyce also suffered from a number of complicated physical health complaints, including the sequelae to a badly broken leg, and received regular, funded Carer Support arising from her myriad physical health and mobility issues.

In November 2019 Ms Moyce was referred by her then EPUT Care Coordinator to the EPUT Psychotherapy Service in November 2019. She started therapy in May 2020, and this continued until 9 June 2021. When referred to and accepted by the Psychotherapy Services her therapist became her Lead Clinician and, the evidence established, she no longer had an EPUT Care Coordinator. Ms Moyce had last had contact with a Care Coordinator in November 2019. At the conclusion of the therapy no new Care Coordinator was identified.

Following the last session with the psychotherapist Ms Moyce was discharged from the Psychotherapy Department back to the care of her GP. The therapist gave evidence to the effect that upon this discharge back to the GP Ms Moyce was, to the therapist’s understanding, discharged from EPUT and confirmed that she made no further plans or arrangements with respect to Ms Moyce’s care, monitoring, safeguarding or follow up of any kind whatsoever (save to confirm that should she wish to return for further therapy she could do after six months had elapsed – coincidentally around the period of the next scheduled annual Section 117 review).

Evidence called at the inquest established that, notwithstanding the fact that Ms Moyce had been and continued to remain subject to the provisions of Section 117 and under the care of EPUT there was: (a) no identifiable person responsible for her ongoing care provision; (b) her case had not been discussed at an MDT meeting prior to or following her discharge from the psychotherapy; (c) no safety-netting or further care planning of any kind was arranged prior to or following the discharge from therapy. Whilst an annual Section 117 review would have been scheduled for the following December no plans for any other active/proactive involvement with Ms Moyce of any kind had been identified by EPUT practitioners.

Further, her partner and main carer had not received, as it was accepted in evidence he should have, a ‘Carer’s Review’ since 2016.

Additionally, and notwithstanding the myriad suicide attempts referred to above, her partner and main carer had not been invited to contribute to Ms Moyce’s Section 117 review in December 2020 contrary to paragraph 8 of EPUT’s own ‘Pan Essex Section 117 MHA1983 Protocol’.

On 30 July 2021, Ms Moyce took her own life by [REDACTED]; she was discovered by her partner.","1. Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians/staff, is responsible for ensuring that a clear and comprehensive discharge plan is formulated for those coming to the end of a course of psychotherapy where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place/has not been replaced;

2. Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians/staff has the responsibility for oversight of patient care following discharge, including responsibility for ensuring adequate and appropriate safety-netting is in place in the event of relapse, where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place/has not been replaced;

3. Evidence confirmed that patients under psychotherapy are not presently routinely discussed in the locality multi-disciplinary team meetings prior to their discharge leading to a missed opportunity: (a) to share information about the specific progress, vulnerabilities and risks of relapse of the patient (and measures to mitigate or deal with the same); as well as (b) to organise and follow up the overall discharge planning.

4. The evidence in this case indicated that, contrary to EPUT’s own established protocol, a patient’s carer (in this case her long-term partner where no confidentiality issues were identified) are not in practice always “seen as equal partners in the development and review of Section 117 after-care plans” and involved directly in such reviews.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 09/02/2022. The medical cause of death was: 1a) Hanging by the neck 1b) 1c) 1d) 2 The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide. The mental health assessment carried out on 28/02/2019 was inadequate.,"Theo Brennan Hulme had a diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome and a history of deliberate self-harm. Theo was a student at the University of East Anglia from September 2018. He referred himself to the Wellbeing Team on 25 September with low mood and depression and he attended Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on 26 September 2018 with a history of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Contact was made with Theo’s mother who came to be with Theo who decided to continue at university. He was referred to the Youth Mental Health Team. Theo was discharged from the service without being seen or spoken to. On 26 January 2019 Theo became distressed and had thoughts of suicide following his taking drugs and consuming alcohol. An appointment with the Wellbeing Service arranged for 31 January 2019 was cancelled due to staff sickness and rearranged for 6 March 2019. On 28 February 2019 Theo sought help from the University General Practitioner Service and was referred as an emergency to the community Mental Health Service. He had had thoughts of stabbing himself or drinking bleach. The referral time for an emergency is 4 hours. Theo was seen at 8 hours due to service demands. He was assessed at Hellesdon Hospital. Theo presented with a deterioration in his mental state and with suicidal ideation. He was concerned about his future accommodation, relationships and his university workload. The assessment took at most 41 minutes. Reasonable adjustments were not made to take into account Theo’s diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome, contact was not made with Theo’s family and he was not referred to the Mental Health Home Treatment Team to enable treatment options to be explored. Theo did not attend the Wellbeing Service appointment on 6 March 2019. This was not followed up by the Service. On 9 March Theo exchanged text messages and attended a social event when he did not indicate his intention to take his own life. On 12 March 2019 Theo’s room was forcibly entered following concerns being raised for his welfare. Theo was found hanging and was declared dead at the scene.","1. Evidence was heard of a historic culture of bullying and harassment within the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team which has led to a loss of compassion in some instances with the view that some suicides are “inevitable” and some reluctance to recognise when cases should be referred to the Team. Work has been undertaken by the Trust to improve such cultural attitudes. However, it was recognised in evidence that there is “still a distance to go” and areas where the culture needs to change. It is of concern that this culture remains three years following Theo’s death

2. Following an assessment, a person is still discharged from the Community Team without any immediate “check” or discussion as to the correctness of this decision. It was heard that following Theo’s death immediate discharge from the Community Team following assessment is relatively rare. In these circumstances, such a discussion would not place an onerous burden on the Team and would enable a review of the discharging decision to be undertaken to ensure it is the correct decision.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

Brown,Essex,NHS England; Essex Partnership University Trust,,"Jan Goodliffe died on 15 June 2021 at an address where he worked in Rochford Essex due to [REDACTED]. He had a long history of mental health problems during his life and had periods as an inpatient during his life. A few days prior to his death, he had tried to [REDACTED] himself, but a family member had found him and prevented anything happening. Mr Goodliffe lived with his wife and was consistently expressing views around him wishing to take his own life. He was visited by clinicians prior to his death, who were not medically qualified, yet deemed him not at risk of suicide, despite his wife expressing concerns and telling them that he had taken medication to calm himself down prior to their arrival and setting out his attempt to take his own life a short while prior. It was also in evidence that Mr Goodliffe had been prescribed medication by his psychiatrist in March of 2021, however, there appears to be an issue with how these to be on repeat prescription, evidence showed that [REDACTED] was potentially meant to reorder these, and a mistake occurred which meant he went without this medication for bipolar for the month of May 2021. It was communicated to the clinicians that attended to see Mr Goodliffe of his apparent decline without the medication for the month period (he had at that appointment restarted this medication). However, when he had been first prescribed this medication, he was an inpatient and the trust extended his inpatient stay to ensure the medication was working correctly. All this was communicated to the clinicians at the home appointment. Several days later Mr Goodliffe took his own life.","That the clinicians who attended to assess Mr Goodliffe were not medically qualified, they were social workers. They were presented with evidence around a serious attempt by Mr Goodliffe to take his own life that he had to be cut down by a family member. [REDACTED] gave all this information at the assessment along with the recent reintroduction of the bipolar medication, and the facts of the previous reintroduction when starting his medication and the time taken for this medication to start to work. As they were unqualified medical practitioners, there were missed opportunities to seek qualified medical advice around the interactions of the medication and whether as a result of this contributed to his death.

I am concerned that suitably medically qualified clinicians are not being used in the home assessments and decisions are being made around issues that require medical expertise.",True,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

McLoughlin,Yorkshire West Eastern,Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,"On 23 September 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Neil Peter Bastock, aged 57. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 November 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide due to [REDACTED]","Neil Peter Bastock had a medical history of paranoid schizophrenia involving numerous incidents of attempting suicide and self-harming behaviour. He was detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 on 8 July 2020, and admitted to the Newsam Centre. On 17 September 2020, when the (then Section 3) was rescinded, On 20 September 2021, Mr Bastock committed suicide by [REDACTED]","1. The decision to rescind the section on 17.09.2020 was made:

a. by a responsible clinician who had been in this role for only two weeks.
b. his family were not involved in the decision at all and only became aware of it after it had been made.
c. no formalised assessment of his mental capacity was made prior to the decisions.
d. his care plan had not been updated.
e. the pressure on bed availability in the Newsam Centre may have influenced the decision.

2. Mr Bastock’s treatment in the Newsam Centre lacked continuity. The responsible clinician was a locum who had recently taken over from another locum psychiatrist. There was no ward manager on the ward to provide leadership for the care being provided. There was no psychologist on the ward to contribute to care planning. The nursing records were incomplete, possibly due to teething problems associated with the recently introduced electronic recording system.

3. When the section was rescinded, Mr Bastock became a voluntary patient on the ward. In the three days following 17.09.2020, various factors should have triggered a need to reconsider the decision, including:
a) Mr Bastock left the ward on occasions and once did not return until 5am.
b) On his return, there was no recorded evaluation of his situation and what action was required from the team treating him.
c) A family member voiced concern that he was unwell and was not ready to be discharged, yet this warning was not heeded.
d) Another family member reported that he had gone to his former partner (whom he had not seen for several years) to give her £250 he had withdrawn from a cash machine for his children. The possibility that this act amounted to a farewell gesture was noted in the nursing record, but its significance was not sufficiently considered.
e) Mr Bastock had indicated he felt unable to live alone. Although a social work assessment had taken place, no plan in relation to alternative accommodation had materialised. In the absence of such transition infrastructure, it was premature to consider him for discharge from the section.
f) When Mr Bastock left the ward, there was a failure to notify the police of him as a missing person, given his suicide risk (irrespective of whether this complied with the prevailing missing person’s policy stipulated timescales).",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Hassell,London Inner North,Chief Executive East London NHS Foundation Trust,"On 25 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Freeda Glausiusz, aged 32 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday.

I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide whilst suffering a psychotic episode.",Freeda Glausiusz jumped from her [REDACTED] home on 15 May 2021. Her father had called the crisis line in desperation the day before. His call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved. It is unclear whether any alternative action by the crisis team would have changed the outcome.,"1. I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that [REDACTED] made to the crisis line the day before his daughter died.

The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks during the conversation; did not listen to [REDACTED]; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis.

In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. [REDACTED] was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter’s mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled.

The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively.

I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts.

• This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line.

• Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz’s death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper.

• When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance.

2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroner’s officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because [REDACTED] told my officer about it.

• I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest.

• I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest.

• I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month.

• I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest.

• I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief.

• Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August.

This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths. And it does not demonstrate respect for the family of the deceased.",True,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

Cox,Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly,"Dr [REDACTED], Medical Director, Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust","On 14/10/21, I concluded an inquest into the death of Kirsty Marie Doodes who died on 27/3/20.

The medical cause of death was recorded as:
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
I recorded a conclusion of a death from suicide.","Kirsty was a 37-year-old lady with a long history of mental ill-health and an established diagnosis of an emotionally unstable personality disorder. Following a deterioration in her presentation she was admitted under s2 MHA to Carbis ward, Longreach on 3 March 2020. She attempted to [REDACTED] on five occasions. On 18 March 2020, an appropriate decision was made to discharge her from section and the ward. This coincided with the national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kirsty deteriorated at home. She was attended upon by mental health staff on 24 March 2020 and informed that she would either require a lengthy detention in a specialist unit or she could try to work with clinicians in a community setting. She opted for the latter. On 27 March 2020, Kirsty [REDACTED]. She was taken to Derriford Hospital but could not be resuscitated and died from her injuries.","i) Insufficiency of note-keeping.

The note made by Dr [REDACTED] in the RiO records was described by an independent expert, Dr [REDACTED], as extremely brief. I accept that medical notes should not be defensive in nature but there is nothing at all in it to justify the view expressed that Kirsty was safe to go home. In a context where she has, over a very recent period, attempted to [REDACTED] on five occasions, the rationale explaining how it was felt she was safe to go home should, in my view, have been set out.
Of perhaps more significance is that there was nothing in the note to assist clinicians with understanding how the future care plan was to be organised. That was in a context where a national lockdown was imminent. Given the unprecedented circumstances, it seems apparent to me that there was all the more reason to provide detail in this regard. The fact it was not set out, it seems to me, implies that there was doubt on the part of Dr [REDACTED] about how the plan to continue treating Kirsty was to be organised. My fear is that this simply passed the burden of the management of the risk to [REDACTED]. This reached an entirely foreseeable crisis in the early hours of 23 March. Kirsty had deteriorated to the point she was described as very suicidal. [REDACTED] was exhausted from his desperate efforts to keep his wife safe. He rang the ward for assistance. There was no one available to help him. [REDACTED] was advised to call the emergency services. He rang the police who told him to ring the ambulance service who told him to ring the CMHT in the morning. This should not have happened. A detailed plan with how to manage an acute deterioration could have prevented it.
At the time, Doctor [REDACTED] was effectively carrying the burden of two consultant psychiatrists in that Dr [REDACTED] was away from work. I indicated at inquest that if this was due to under-resourcing of the Trust, I would write to those responsible for funding. I was advised that, in fact, the problem may be due to a scarcity of consultant psychiatrists nationally. I would be grateful if you could please let me know the position.

iii) Lack of involvement of family/carer in discharge process

The Trust’s own discharge policy states:

3. Principles

The decision to discharge someone from hospital must be in keeping with the Care Programme Approach (CPA), (DH 1991, 2008) and governed by the following principles:

The patient, carer and / or advocate, must be actively involved in all aspects of the discharge plan, where practicable. Arrangements for discharge should be negotiated with everyone likely to be concerned with the service user’s aftercare.

[REDACTED] was Kirsty’s carer. He had not been ‘actively involved in all aspects of the discharge plan.’ He had a phone call to come and collect her and on arriving at the hospital he found her bag to be packed. He did not feel as though he was given any choice.

I acknowledged at inquest that there were extenuating circumstances in that Kirsty’s discharge coincided with the first national lockdown during the COVID pandemic. Nevertheless, I think it is appropriate to bring to your attention whether there is a need to remind clinicians to involve families and carers in a meaningful way during the discharge process.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Parsley,Suffolk,"Rt Hon Nadine Dorries MP; Minister for Patient Safety, Suicide Prevention and Mental Health; Department of Health and Social Care; The Chief Executive Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust","On 10 September 2019 I commenced an investigation into the tragic death of Joshua Sahota

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 September 2021. The jury conclusion of the inquest was that:-

The jury recognise that Josh was an intelligent, polite, reserved well-loved and supported young man by his family and friends.

Joshua Sahota died as a result of asphyxia, by deliberately placing a plastic bag over his head and use of a bed sheet around his neck.

We the jury were unable to determine Josh’s state of mind at the time of his death.

The below contributing factors led to Josh’s death.
• Insufficient staffing
• Insufficient observations and 1 to 1’s
• Inadequate formal documentation
• No psychologist available.
• Unclear restricted items policy.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1a Asphyxia

2 Psychosis","Joshua was a 25-year-old man who on the 2 August 2019 intentionally drove his car off a bridge on the A11 landing on the A14 dual-carriageway beneath.

This incident caused Joshua chest and pelvis injuries and as a result he was admitted to the Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge on the same day.

Whilst Joshua had been an inpatient at Addenbrookes he had been seen by a psychiatrist and deemed to be at a continuing high risk of self-harm.

As such, when Joshua was deemed medically fit, his discharge was directly to a psychiatric bed on Southgate Ward, Wedgewood House, Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk.

Joshua’s admission took place on the 9 August 2019 as an informal patient.

As Joshua was admitted directly from Addenbrookes he was in a hospital gown only, as his clothes had been cut from him when he arrived at Addenbrookes hospital from the scene of the road collision.

Joshua’s family were asked to take fresh clothes to Southgate ward, which they did in a plastic carrier bag. The bag was emptied by a member of staff, the contents were searched, re-packed and then taken to Josh’s room.

At this time plastic bags were a ‘restricted item’ on the ward, but Joshua’s family had not been told this.

On the 15 August 2019 Joshua was transferred to Northgate Ward, another ward within Wedgewood House.

On the 9 September 2019 at 17:07 Joshua was found in his room with bed sheet around his neck and the plastic carrier bag over his head.

CPR commenced by staff based on the ward and they were subsequently joined by paramedics.

Despite resuscitation attempts recognition of life extinct was timed at 17:45.

At the time of his death Joshua was on hourly observations on the ward.","Relate to the communication of what are ‘restricted and contraband items’ to the family and friends of a patient, before those family and friends visit the mental health ward.

This would be particularly important for a family or friend's first visit to the ward.

The court was told that there are signs up at the entrance of the ward detailing items that are ‘contraband’. These items are not allowed onto the ward in any circumstances.

This makes it clear to all visitors what cannot be taken onto the ward in any circumstances.

However, the court was told that a ‘restricted item’ regime also exists, under which patients are risk assessed, with some being allowed particular items (such as mobile phone charger leads, laptop leads, belts and lighters), whilst others are not.

From the evidence we heard in this case, we know that Josh’s clothes were taken onto the ward in a plastic carrier bag, which at the time was a restricted item.

We heard that the bag was emptied, the contents were searched, re-packed and then taken to Josh’s room.

From the investigation into this matter, it is apparent that firstly, that had the family known that a plastic carrier bag was a restricted item, it would not have been taken to the hospital in the first instance.

Secondly, that had the family been aware that a plastic carrier bag was a restricted item, even though they may have used one to deliver Josh’s clothes, they would have drawn staff attention to the bag when it was subsequently taken and left in Josh’s room.

During the evidence no clear system or procedure was identified, for a family to be notified of any particular items that have been deemed ‘restricted’ items for their loved one to have in their possession.

There was therefore no effective communication with the family regarding what items were, and what items were not, allowed onto the ward in Josh’s case.

I am therefore concerned that families and friends of current in-patients, may still inadvertently take a particular item onto ward, or be aware that their loved one has a particular item in their possession, yet be totally unaware that that particular item has been risk assessed as a restricted item for their loved one.

It is known that families and friends of in-patients can play a vital role in their care, treatment and recovery. However, without knowing what have been deemed ‘restricted items’ for their loved one, the ability to assist in keeping their loved one safe whilst an in-patient, is effectively removed from those family and friends.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

On 24 February 2021 she was found unresponsive attached to a ligature at her home address [REDACTED] West Downs Road.
Conclusion of the coroner as to the death: Died from the complications of suspension from a ligature.","1. The inquest heard evidence that she was being treated by the NHS Mental Health Trust, GP and through private therapy provided by her employer. As a consequence, the professionals treating her did not have a full picture of disclosures made by her and professionals operated in silos. There was no protocol in place for information sharing between those involved and no policy to guide appropriate steps to obtain information. A query raised with the GP would have enabled a clearer picture of the issues to be held by the private provider. Information sharing would have provided a more rounded understanding of risks.
The operation in silos meant that the treatment plan put in place by the mental health team including medication was not fully understood by the GP and was altered following a consultation between the GP and Fadhia. Information sharing between agencies would have allowed for a more detailed assessment of risk in the situation.

2. As a consequence of Covid all of the assessments of her by her GP in relation to her mental health were done via telephone. Prior to Covid it was likely that they would have been done face to face. It was accepted that assessments of mental health risk and understanding of need was far easier to assess face to face.

3. The inquest heard evidence that she had on a previous occasion been taken to A and E due to concerns that she would take her own life/self-harm. Due to Covid she had to go alone to A and E and was assessed alone without input from her family who were aware of the full picture. The experience of attending alone whilst experiencing mental health issues was deeply stressful for her and meant that she had been unsupported by her family at a time of crisis.

He was known to EPUT 

At approximately 11.20 hours on 26 June 2020 the driver of the [REDACTED] Cambs North to Liverpool Street was coming around the track curve, when he saw a man stood under the bridge next to Gipsy Lane. As soon as he saw the train, this male pushed off the wall and headed into the path of the train. The driver was travelling at 70 mph and was unable to stop. Mr Regoli was identified by his fingerprints. EPUT prepared a 7-day report, which was being used during the COVID pandemic. This report set out the detail of the issues that Steven Regoli had, he was predominantly living with his elderly parents who had consistently in evidence at the inquest said that they tried to get inpatient care for their son as they were struggling to cope, describing having to sleep by the front door to stop him leaving, where he would then take illicit drugs and overdose. The report set out that he was admitted to Peter Bruff Ward following an overdose and was discharged 7 days later and within 3 days had taken [REDACTED] tablets, following this and the next day it was determined that he should be discharged back to his mother’s address.

On 18 June 2020 - 8 days before Steven died, he told his care coordinator he felt like ending his own, which he then subsequently did.","In the 7 day report it set out numerous opportunities for Steven and his family to have more appropriate help to include inpatient stay for Steven given his history of overdoses and his worsening anxiety and depression. He had spoken about taking himself down to the railway line on other occasions as he used to work near there. Steven, due to his anxiety and with COVID restrictions was unable to engage but he struggled engaging with people before these restrictions.

During the inquest, there were clear signs that Steven needed more in depth help as did his family, but due to him not engaging, which was a major part of his symptoms he was never given the pathway or help he needed and there were no systems in place for this to happen.

Jones,Cambridgeshire and Peterborough,Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England (as the bodies responsible for the National Poisons Information Service); The Royal College of Psychiatrists,"On 16 April 2020, an investigation was commenced into the death of JAMES MICHAEL NOWSHADI aged 23 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 June 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was:

• James’ death was a suicide, caused by him deliberately ingesting [REDACTED]
• James had a long-standing history of depression for which he was latterly involved with the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Mental Health Trust, and had expressed his clear intent to end his own life by taking [REDACTED] that he had ordered via the internet from Poland. Because he was deemed to have capacity, it was not thought appropriate to inform his family (with whom he lived) of his intentions, even if their intervention could have potentially prevented his death
• There was little knowledge or understanding of the role of [REDACTED] in suicides by those involved in James’ care and insufficient exploration of how James had alighted upon [REDACTED] as the means by which he proposed to end his life, which meant that there was also inadequate consideration of whether this could be a factor in other patients’ suicidal ideation.","James had a history of depression and low mood. From 2016 onwards, he was in receipt of regular therapy and counselling which seemed to have improved his mental wellbeing but in early 2020, he was referred to mental health services when he began expressing specific plans to end his own life. James was seen by clinicians from various teams where he disclosed further details about his intentions. He did not want information about his plans to be disclosed to his family. James was considered to have capacity to make decisions about his care. Although consideration was given to whether to override his stated wishes and inform his family so that they could help to safeguard him, it was felt that the risk of suicide was insufficiently imminent to warrant breaching his right to confidentiality.

Prior to commencing treatment, James had ordered via the internet a quantity of [REDACTED], which he proposed to take at a future date as a means of ending his life. He was open about his plans with those treating him but could not be persuaded to share his thoughts with his family nor dispose of the [REDACTED]. He agreed to continuing engagement with mental health services and was deemed not to meet the criteria for admission to hospital.

In late March 2020, James had not put into effect his plans and appeared to be looking forward to starting a new job and engaging with new psychological treatment options. On the evening of 31 March 2020, James was found unresponsive in his bedroom at the family home, before he had a seizure. An ambulance was called and paramedics attended and gave him emergency care but he went into cardiac arrest. He was taken to Addenbrooke’s hospital where despite further attempts at resuscitation, he was pronounced dead at 01.47 hours on 1 April 2020. Tests on his blood revealed that he had a methaemoglobin level of 90% as a likely consequence of ingesting the [REDACTED]. It is very unlikely that any further medical intervention could have changed the outcome and the prolonged period in cardiac arrest was thought to be unsurvivable.","1. There does not appear to be any national guidance available to psychiatrists and mental health practitioners dealing with possible [REDACTED] cases. Those involved in James’ care made insufficient effort to research or evaluate the potential risks and consequences of James obtaining and using the [REDACTED] to end his life and any information that was obtained from brief internet searches was not disseminated to colleagues beyond those immediately involved in James’ case only. I am concerned that there is a risk of future fatalities if mental health practitioners do not have ready access to timely and up-to-date information about the risks associated with sodium nitrate/nitrite.

2. The family raised concerns about the risks of [REDACTED] in suicides as part of the Serious Incident Review undertaken by the Trust but this section was omitted from the final report at the direction of the SIR review panel. This meant that there was a missed opportunity for the Trust to reflect on lessons that may properly be learned from James’ death, an omission which they now appear to be taking steps to remedy. However, I am concerned that there is a risk of future fatalities at a national level if Mental Health Trusts are not using Serious Incident Reviews and other internal investigations to learn lessons from suicide cases, including about the risks presented by sodium nitrate/nitrite.

3. The inquest heard evidence from a senior Accident & Emergency doctor about the information available from the National Poisons Information Service to emergency departments who encounter patients who have ingested [REDACTED]. This included information about the potential availability of an antidote, ‘methylene blue’. However, there is apparently no national guidance about the appropriate use of the antidote in cases involving cardiac arrest and whether attempts should be made to administer it in such cases. I am concerned that there is a risk of future fatalities if A&E clinicians do not have access to comprehensive and up-to-date information about toxic substances and their possible antidotes to know when – and when not – to administer treatment.",False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False
2481,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/angela-frost/,2021-0183,2021-05-28,C. McKenna,Greater Manchester North,"Executive Medical Director, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust",On 28 August 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Angela Marie Frost. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 May 2021. The medical cause of death was (1a) amitriptyline overdose. The conclusion of the inquest was 'suicide whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed.',"The Deceased was admitted to Aspen Ward, Royal Oldham Hospital on 8 June 2020 following a mixed overdose. She complained of sensations which included feeling that her insides 'melting,' that she had 'hot lava' and 'snakes in her stomach' and 'a brain haemorrhage causing trickling in her head.' Hormonal tests undertaken during the admission established that the Deceased was post-menopausal. The Consultant Psychiatrist with responsibility for the Deceased was of the opinion that the sensations were related to the menopause rather than a psychosis. A GP trainee spoke to a Gynaecology Registrar who advised that HRT was contraindicated and recommended the use of herbal alternatives. The Deceased declined to take the herbal alternative and was discharged from the ward on 2 July 2020 on anti-psychotic medication. The Consultant Psychiatrist recommendation that a referral be made by primary care to Gynaecology to discuss HRT alternatives was not communicated to the Deceased's GP.

On 21 July 2020, the Deceased was re-admitted to Aspen Ward after being located in woodland. She had been missing for 7 days with the express intention that she starve herself to death. During her second admission, her anti-psychotic medication was increased. The Consultant Psychiatrist formulated a diagnosis of 'profound menopause with secondary kinaesthetic hallucinatory experiences.' These diagnoses do not feature in ICD-10 and a second opinion was not requested or obtained by the Consultant Psychiatrist. No contact was made with the Specialist Pharmacist attached to the locality to establish whether HRT was contraindicated and no further contact was made with the Gynaecology team. Had enquiries been made with the pharmacy team, it is more likely than not that it would have established that HRT was not absolutely contraindicated and therefore would have been a potential treatment option.

The Deceased's family members were not involved in discussions around all available treatment options and despite leaving messages for the Consultant Psychiatrist to contact them, sufficient enquiries were not made as to whether the Deceased consented to their involvement in her care. It is more likely than not that had sufficient enquiries been made, the Deceased would have consented to sharing information with her family which would have provided her with a source of support in her decision-making.

The Deceased was last seen by a mental health professional on 20 August 2020 during which she described an improvement in her symptoms. She was found deceased at her home address on 24 August 2020 having taken an intentional overdose of her partner's old medication.","(1) There is no formal guidance or process in place at the Trust for Consultant Psychiatrists to seek a second opinion in relation to diagnosis, treatment plans or whether a patient meets the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act.

(2) There is no formal guidance or process in place at the Trust for health care professionals or family members to seek a second opinion in relation to the matters set out above.

Mundy,Yorkshire South East,"The National Probation Service, Director General","On 4 October 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Todd James Salter. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was:

Suicide

1a Suspension by ligature","Mr Salter was released from prison on licence in July 2019. Upon his release there was confusion regarding which organisation had responsibility to assist him with housing leading to him residing with his family. This had a deleterious effect on Mr Salter’s mental health as independent living was a key element of him being able to re-establish contact with his daughters. As time progressed Mr Salter’s struggles with life increased, the spice habit he had in prison combined with life challenges led to him taking illicit drugs. Although Mr Salter wished to overcome his drug habit he and his family struggled to obtain support needed from the various agencies. Of note was that the Probation officer who had been assigned to Mr Salter stated in evidence that she did not know that an option available to her was to contact ASPIRE Drug and Alcohol Service for Doncaster. She further stated in evidence that she did not know that they could have referred Mr Salter for an assessment, could have sought advice from a Consultant psychiatrist and could have liaised with mental health services together with Mr Salter’s mother. These were all crucial elements in providing Mr Salter with the support he clearly needed. As it was, the Probation officer was exploring options to have Mr Salter recalled but communication with Mr Salter as to her intentions in this regard were far from clear. By the 30 September 2019 he was at crisis point, left his mother’s address, made his way to Doncaster police station where at some time between 02:41 a.m. and 07:15 a.m. on the 1 October 2019 Mr Salter hanged himself outside the police station.","(1) The lack of knowledge of the probation officer as to the services she could contact to obtain necessary mental health assessments. This would appear at the very least to suggest this gap in knowledge may be due to inadequate training.

(2) Mr Salter being driven to desperate measures of committing criminal acts in an effort to be arrested or recalled in order to secure treatment and support; this appeared to be the way matters were moving forward without engaging with appropriate mental health services.

Murray,Greater Manchester South,Greater Manchester Mental Health; NHS England,On 6 February 2020 an investigation commenced into the death of Stephen Thurm. The investigation concluded on 5 May 2021 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a hanging.,"Stephen Thurm endured mental health problems commencing in adolescence, which were heightened after his sister, Helena, was killed by a motorist in 6 2016.

Stephen was detained at the Moorside Unit at Trafford General Hospital in 9 2016 after he had smashed up his bedroom and threatened to jump from a high building. Over the following months Stephen’s mental health fluctuated and he often locked himself in his room at the family home. In 12 2016 Stephen took an overdose of medication and was found barricaded in a hotel room in Manchester. He had repeatedly denied suicidal ideation. He spent a further period in the Moorside Unit from 12 2016 to 4 2017, following which he soon began isolating himself again. He was detained under the Mental Health Act again in 5 2017.

Stephen’s engagement with the mental health team was sporadic. He continued to self-medicate with non-prescription drugs, alcohol and illicit substances. A further suicide attempt by Stephen was reported by one of his friends to Stephen’s mother. Stephen denied this. He was under the care of consultant psychiatrists and psychologists but there was no face to face contact with either discipline after 8 2019. Stephen’s parents reported their concerns that he remained a suicide risk. Stephen’s behaviour became more unusual and he was displaying paranoia. On 26 11 2019 Stephen went missing and was found by the police and brought home. He continued to isolate himself and consume excess alcohol and use cannabis, cocaine and MDMA to self-medicate. On the 5 2 2020 Stephen was found suspended by a rope from a tree near to the 15th hole of Dunham Forest Golf and Country Club. He died at the scene on the 5 2 2020 from hanging which is likely to have resulted in asphyxia.","1. The inquest heard that information regarding the risk of self-harm to Stephen was passed by his family to his treating clinicians and his care coordinator but this was not taken into account as Stephen denied a recent attempt to take his own life. What steps could be taken to ensure family information is taken into account in the relevant care plan and risk assessments.

2. The inquest heard that there is no designated gap between service user appointments to allow care coordinators to write up their detailed notes contemporaneously.

Brown,Birmingham and Solihull,Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust; the Care Commissioning Group for Birmingham and Solihull; the Care Quality Commission; the Health and Safety Executive,"On 15 May 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Azra Parveen Hussain also known as Azra Parveen Sultan. The investigation concluded at the end of a 6 day inquest on 22 March 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was 'Suicide' and the jury also answered a set of questions which identify that they concluded:

1. On 24 March 2020 there was a missed opportunity to commence ECT treatment and it is likely that Azra's death would have been prevented if she had undergone ECT.
2. On 6 May 2020 there was a foreseeable risk that Azra would attempt suicide, that risk had not been adequately identified by those caring for her, adequate measures had not been taken to mitigate her risk and with adequate measures it is likely that Azra's death would have been prevented.
3. On 6 May 2020 there was a foreseeable risk that the en-suite bathroom door would be used as a ligature point, adequate measures had not been taken to mitigate the risk and with adequate measures it is likely that Azra's death would have been prevented.","On 6 May 2020 Azra was found at approximately 18:25 hours hanging from her en-suite bathroom door in room 14 on Ward 2 of Mary Seacole House having used her bedding to create a noose. Mary Seacole House is operated and staffed by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust ('BSMHT'). Azra had been detained there on 26 December 2019 under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. She was on 15 minute observations and was last recorded as being seen at 18:09 when she was on her bed. An ambulance was called at 18:25 and arrived at 18:32. Staff had already cut Azra down and started CPR. She could not be resuscitated and was declared deceased at 19:38.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a SUSPENSION BY LIGATURE AROUND THE NECK
1b
1c
II","1. On 4 May 2020 Azra's mother and daughter had been in telephone contact with the nurse in charge on the ward expressing concerns that Azra had messaged them to say she had attempted suicide using shoelaces as a ligature. The nurse spoke to Azra who denied making a ligature, Azra's neck was examined and she had no marks from ligature use. The shoelaces from one pair of shoes were removed but other shoelaces, clothing and bedding were left in her possession as it was felt that Azra was not at an immediate risk. She was not believed to be at immediate risk because, whilst it was a feature of her mental state common to many patients that she would regularly talk about not wanting to live and requesting an overdose, there was no evidence that she had made an active suicide attempt and she had no history of suicide or self-harm attempts. The fact that she was now saying that she had attempted to make a ligature was a change in her presentation (her previous suicidal ideation had centred around requesting assistance to overdose), it was also of significance that she was saying one thing to her family and something different to a clinician. BSMHT accepted that the information was significant and therefore there ought to have been consideration of it by her treating team with a review of her risk and observation levels. However, no record at all was made of the family's concerns and the account given by Azra. Her risk screen was not updated, an incident report was not raised, and the information was not included in handover to the next shift or at the next MDT on 6 May. Therefore, it was not considered at an MDT meeting on 6 May 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Azra's family could not attend that meeting and raise their concerns directly. Microsoft Teams was used by some clinicians to attend the MDT on 6 May but was not made available to Azra's family nor was a telephone number to dial into the meeting. BSMHT has put in a system for a form to be completed in advance of an MDT which requires the family's input to be sought, placed on the form and considered in the MDT. It is my concern that this is equivalent to the family being included in the meeting (prior to COVID families were invited to attend MDTs): there is the potential that information will not be recorded accurately or will not be understood in written form, it also does not afford family the opportunity to hear the plan arising from the meeting and provide their views. There is no reason why attendance by a remote platform or telephone line at the meeting itself cannot be offered to family for all MDTs.

2. BSMHT had risk assessed ward 2 for ligature points, including the en-suite bathrooms, in November 2019. The en-suite bathroom doors were given the highest risk score possible on an acute ward, but no corrective action was identified to remove or mitigate the risk: the risk assessment relied on clinical assessment and observation of the service user to mitigate the risk. Evidence was given at the inquest that pressure sensor alarms have been available in the UK from numerous manufacturers for 10 years, BSMHT had been investigating and testing different pressure sensor alarms for en-suite bathroom doors for approximately 2 years before Azra's death. BSMHT has now identified an appropriate pressure sensor for en-suite bathroom doors and the en-suite bathroom door of room 14 on ward 2 was replaced in November 2020 with a door incorporating a pressure sensor alarm. BSMHT has a 17 month programme to fit pressure sensor alarms to all en-suite bathroom doors within its inpatient units. However, this is not being considered for other doors within the bedroom area nor is there any national requirement for in-patient mental health units to place, or consider placing, pressure sensor alarms on doors within areas where patients are afforded privacy and time alone. I am concerned that within BSMHT's inpatient units there will be a continuing risk from other doors in the bedroom area (including the main bedroom door) even when the en-suite bathroom doors are fitted with pressure sensor alarms. Although the outer face of a bedroom door will be on a communal corridor, service users on level 1 and 2 observations will have periods where they are unobserved in their rooms and could wedge a ligature at the top of a door so that it was not obviously visible from outside. Furthermore, in the absence of any national regulations or guidance on this topic the risk from en-suite and other doors in areas where service users spend time unobserved will persist in mental health units operated by other Trusts and private providers around the country.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Hassell,London Inner North,Chief Executive Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust (C&I),"On 16 November 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Benjamin Rajinder O’Hara, aged 24 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 March 2021.

I made a determination at inquest that Ben O’Hara jumped from the fourth floor balcony of his home shortly after 10am on Monday, 2 November 2020.

It is unclear whether he was able to form the necessary intent to take his life or whether he was psychotic. He had emotionally unstable personality disorder and drug induced psychoses. He had presented to mental health services with increasing frequency in the last months of his life, at times floridly psychotic.

His medical cause of death was:
1a multiple injuries.","Ben O’Hara was arrested by police under section 136 of the Mental Health Act, and brought to Highgate Mental Health Centre. He had informed police that voices were telling him to jump off his balcony. He was detained under section 2 between 18 and 25 September 2020.

He was then brought in to a hospital emergency department on 29 September in similar circumstances, but was not detained.

He rang the crisis team helpline on 29 and 31 September.

On 2 October, he was found on an eighth floor apparently about to jump and was detained, but only overnight.

His fatal jump took place on 2 November 2020.","1. None of the healthcare professionals who assessed or treated Mr O’Hara in the period leading up to his death asked if he would give permission for his family to be contacted. If she had been told of his deterioration, his mother would have returned from abroad and stayed with him.

2. There was an alert on Mr O’Hara’s medical record, saying that admission to hospital was unhelpful to him. However, this had been placed on the record 18 months before his death and had not been reviewed since. If it had been brought up to date, it could have affected the decision not to detain him on 3 October.

3. The review undertaken on 3 October was with a s12 approved doctor and an approved mental health professional, but was not a formal mental health assessment. If the crisis team had been aware of this, they might have sought a formal mental health assessment when Mr O’Hara disengaged from their care on 4 October.

4. Mr O’Hara did not have a care co-ordinator or other member of the community mental health team in overall charge of his care.

Schofield,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove","Chief Executive, Horsham District Council","On 23 April 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of James Herbertson which concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 November 2020.

At the end of the inquest I concluded “James Kenneth Herbertson, who at the time of his death was under the care of the community mental health team, took his own life whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed. In the days leading up to his death there was a failure to recognise and act upon the clear signs of his mental health relapse and provide him with the additional support he needed.”","On 10 April 2019 at 17:32 hours, James Kenneth Herbertson was struck by a train on the railway near to Crawley train station. His death was confirmed at scene.

James had a history of mental health difficulties. He was first involved with the mental health services in 1998 following a mental health episode which resulted in him being sectioned. However, he absconded and took off for Amsterdam.

We heard that James returned home in April 1999 when he received treatment from the mental health services. This resulted in a diagnosis and prognosis in 2000 of symptoms of schizophrenia with possible effects of substance misuse and depression.

James left the UK again and moved to France. He then remained in France over the next 17 years although he did return home from time to time for short periods.

The next key milestone was in January 2018 when the family became aware that his mental health had deteriorated again. James eventually returned home to the UK on 22 March 2018.

In June 2018 James was detained under the Mental Health Act and admitted to Langley Green Hospital where he remained before being discharged to the care of the Community Mental Health Team on 17 August 2018.

His family felt he was ill prepared for discharge. He declined the offer of a bed at a hostel and slept rough for several nights before eventually being found emergency accommodation at the Grange Hotel. Both the initial accommodation offered and the accommodation at Grange Hotel were unsuitable for someone with the mental health and alcohol misuse issues that James had.

James was allocated a Lead Practitioner to support him upon discharge. However, she had not been involved at the point of discharge.

In the months leading up to James’ death his family had become increasingly concerned about him. James fluctuated as to what involvement he would let his family have. At the beginning of April 2019 James started to discuss moving back to France however his Lead Practitioner told him that she did not think it was a good idea. She did not think his mental health was stable enough.

His Lead Practitioner then had a period of leave. On her return on 8 April she spoke to James. On the phone James was incoherent. He would start a conversation but would not finish it and he made mention that he wanted to go back to hospital. He was clearly showing signs of a relapse.

On 9 April James’ presentation was discussed at a multi-disciplinary meeting. Details of Lead Practitioner’s assessment of him from the previous day was shared with the team and a decision was made to put him on “Red Zone”. This meant he was to be monitored more closely. However, it did not appear that the team had identified that James was becoming acutely unwell. Therefore, there was no referral made to the crisis team. It was left for his Lead Practitioner to monitor him. This was a missed opportunity to render care particularly as his Lead Practitioner would not have been available to contact him on the following day (10 April) as she had been allocated to be the duty worker.

On 9 April James sent his Lead Practitioner a text message asking for return contact. This was sent after 17:00 and was not seen by her that evening or the following day

James took his own life the following day on 10 April at 17:32 hours.","Discharge from Langley Green Hospital – 8/2018 - Sussex Partnership Trust and Horsham District Council (in respect of the housing issue)

a) The discharge arrangements from Langley Green Hospital did not include the lead practitioner who was going to be the primary contact responsible for providing the support to James following discharge. Although she had met him once, no therapeutic relationship had been established and at the point of discharge, she was not aware that discharge had taken place.

b) Although James was vulnerable, his parents were also not aware of his discharge at the point of discharge and therefore were unable to offer support.

c) The accommodation offered to James both on leaving hospital (and subsequently) was not a safe and therapeutic environment for a person who had recognised mental health difficulties with a history of alcohol and substance misuse. Whilst accommodation is a matter for the local authority, the trust staff work with partner agencies in the planning for a S117 discharge.

I heard evidence that iCope does not routinely ask their patients if families may be involved. This seems to be a policy worthy of reconsideration.

2. The 72 hour investigation report that should be produced within 72 hours of death, to enable fast learning that may be of immediate benefit to other patients, was not completed until last week, some five months after Ms Walczak’s death.

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,Department of Health; Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership,On 25 November 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Carole Mitchell. The investigation concluded on 3 February 2021 and the conclusion was one of suicide.,"Carole Mitchell had a long history of involvement with mental health services, including being sectioned under the Mental Health Act and periods of voluntary admission at mental health units. Between 2017 and 2019, she was an inpatient on six occasions. She had three reported attempts to take her own life between 2017 and 2019.

Throughout her time with Mental Health Services, she was reluctant to have information shared with her family. Her family were concerned about her deterioration. In 2019 however attempts by them to share information were not actively pursued by Mental Health Services and as a result information gathering that would have assisted in assessing her was limited.

She was transferred from the Home-Based Treatment Team (HBTT) to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) on 18 April 2019. There was a clear conflict in the understanding between the two teams regarding her care plan at handover, which was not recognised by either team. Following transfer to the care of the CMHT, she was seen less often. This was not fully detailed, or risk assessed.

On 29 April 2019, it was decided Carole Mitchell would benefit from psychological assessment and she was added to the Secondary Care Psychology waiting list. The first appointment was 21 November 2019. The delay was due to a lack of appointments for that service.
It was identified she would benefit from a support worker to work alongside the care co-ordinator. The first support worker's relationship was unsuccessful, and a decision was taken she should be replaced. There was a three month wait for a replacement support worker. There was no formal escalation to seek to prioritise Carole Mitchell, although it was clear the support service would be beneficial to helping her with her mental health.

On 8 October 2019, her husband told mental health services that she had attempted to take an overdose on 6 October 2019. Following that disclosure, her case was not red zoned by her care co-ordinator and there was no face to face assessment to identify if any additional strategies would assist in supporting her or reducing risk.

On 22 November 2019, her husband left home at about 6:45am. He returned home to [REDACTED], Sale at about 6:15pm. He found Carole Mitchell unresponsive on the floor in the main bedroom. Police enquiries found no suspicious circumstances or evidence of third-party involvement in her death. There was no note or message found. Her medication was found by her bedside.

Post-mortem examination, including toxicology, found that she had died from a fatal amount of her prescribed medication.","1. The inquest heard that psychology assessment and therapies can be very beneficial to those with mental health issues in secondary services as well as primary services. The evidence given was that the delay that Mrs Mitchell experienced in accessing that service was reflective of both the regional and national backlog for appointments. The inquest was told that the position had worsened since 2019 and for example someone in Mrs Mitchell’s position today would be more likely to wait 9 months than the 7 months in 2019.

2. Mrs Mitchell on two occasions could not be accommodated locally when an inpatient stay was required. The evidence heard at the inquest was that this was due to limited national mental health bed capacity against the demand within mental health services. The inquest heard evidence that suggested that this impacted on how she could be supported by her family and overall care.

3. It was accepted at the inquest that information gathering from family could be beneficial. However, there was a reluctance by health professionals to fully utilise information gathering due to concerns about breaching patient confidentiality. This appeared to stem from a misunderstanding between the concept of information sharing and information gathering and how they interrelated with the principle of patient confidentiality.",True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False

She had died on 20 September 2019 after jumping in front of a train at Holland Park Underground Station. She was 31 years old at the time of her death.

How, when, where Ms Munoz Biggs came by her death:

On 20 September 2019, Valeria jumped in front of a westbound train at Holland Park Station at approximately 13:20. She was killed instantly. She had suffered with affective disorder since age 18 years and had received treatment for this successfully in Chile, including in the spring of 2019.

In September of 2019 she developed an exacerbation of her symptoms. She contacted her psychiatrist who recommended increasing quetiapine to [REDACTED] and restarting clonazepam which had previously assisted.

On 12/9/2019 she was actively suicidal and sought help on the advice of her psychiatrist of NHS services. [REDACTED] attended, which in turn spoke to the Single Point of Access for West London Mental Health Trust. Her symptoms were not taken sufficiently seriously.

She attended A&E where she was found by Liaison Psychiatry to be mentally unwell and admission was discussed. She was concerned about admission and so was referred to the Crisis Home Treatment Team, with a recommendation for low threshold for admission if her risk escalated or her family were not coping. She was directed to care in the community by the Home Treatment Team.

Overnight she was actively suicidal, attending a train station with thoughts of jumping before a train. This continued the next day. The Home Treatment Team did not visit on 13 September 2019 as planned and did not assess her suicidality or speak with the family, despite a contact from police that afternoon, informing them that a member of public had found her wandering expressing a wish to take her own life. I find this to be gross failure on the part of the Trust.

Suicidal thoughts continued especially on 15 September 2019. These were underestimated by the visiting team.

By 15 September 2019, she had left the flat with the intention to take her own life on four occasions. The family were unable to keep her safe.

There were delays in psychiatric assessment, failure to increase her drugs adequately and persistent underestimation of her suicidality and failure to adequately engage with and listen to the family and note their concerns.

There was team culture of positive risk taking.

If she had been adequately assessed and admitted to hospital, her death would not have occurred at this time.

Conclusion of the coroner as to the death:

Valeria took her own life whilst suffering agitated depression possibly on the bipolar spectrum. Her death was contributed to by neglect.","On 20 September 2019, Valeria jumped in front of a westbound train at Holland Park Station at approximately 13:20. She was killed instantly.

He had tied a red rope around his neck and suspended himself from the rafter and placed electrical items around the space to make access difficult. He has over 20 years in the armed forces with two tours of duty and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and was receiving treatment.

His treatment continued during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. No risk assessment was completed on the issue of moving mental health appointments to virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic and how patients could be kept safe in the event of deterioration in his mental health. There was no plan in place for patients that required urgent assessment/review due to deterioration in their mental health.

2. Care plan had not been updated since October 2019 and his risk assessment remained the same even when the scores changed and there was evidence of escalating risk behaviour.

3. Risk issues were not shared with the family even though Sgt Hills was in lockdown with them and there were no discussions regarding sharing of information. He disclosed his dry runs of self-strangulation on 28 February and 16 April and his withdrawal/isolation from his family who had been very supportive of him. On 22 April he disclosed he was looking for a rafter to harm himself from and there was an overreliance on his family as a protective factor in the absence of this knowledge being shared with them.

4. His risk assessment was not up-to-date and his disclosures during April were not documented.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 13th September 2019.","The deceased had a history that included a dual diagnosis with polysubstance misuse and borderline personality disorder. Additionally, he had suffered episodic anxiety and depressive disorders and presumed emotionally unstable personality disorder.
In 2016 the deceased developed alcohol related pancreatitis that had deteriorated into a chronic condition causing him to endure persistent significant pain. He was prescribed opiate based analgesia to which he had become addicted.
There was a significant history of self-harm and previous attempts to take his life.
In March 2018 the deceased had taken an intentional overdose and had received in-patient care but had subsequently self-discharged.
In April 2018 he presented to the hospital in Grantham due to an exacerbation of his pancreatitis and it was noted that there was a further deterioration in his mental state with associated stressors including social problems, hopelessness and suicidal ideation with intent.
He was admitted as a voluntary inpatient at Cygnet Hospital Wyke, Bradford where his condition was actively treated, managed and monitored. By 17 April 2018 the deceased had been assessed and approved for discharge despite warnings communicated by the family that the deceased presented as significant and continuing risk to himself – such warnings not having been communicated to the discharging clinician. He was assessed as presenting as low risk of self-harm and was placed into the care of the Grantham Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team.
The deceased went to reside at temporary accommodation at [REDACTED] Five Bells Public House, 79 Brook Street, Grantham, Lincolnshire. The facility was accepted to be sub-optimal. On 2 May 2018 the Crisis Team considered that the deceased had disengaged from the service and so he was discharged into the Community Mental Health Team.
On 17 May 2018, the deceased was discovered in a collapsed and unresponsive condition having self-suspended himself by a belt to an improvised point of suspension in his room at the Public House.
Post mortem samples established an absence of alcohol, but confirmed the presence of a variety of the deceased's prescribed and non-prescribed medications but at therapeutic levels.
Between 17 April 2018 and 17 May 2018 the treatment and care within the community was managed conservatively and in a sub-optimal manner thereby resulting in accepted missed opportunities to monitor and appreciate any deterioration in the deceased that might require an escalation in potential treatment and care.

The concerns of the immediate family were not communicated to any of the agencies charged with the responsibility of caring for the deceased, nor were their views sought (directly or indirectly) as to the suitability of the deceased's accommodation and/or circumstances and/or pathway of treatment and care;
2. Unequivocal evidence established that the deceased suffered from an advanced progressive addiction overlaid with a vulnerable personality amounting to a complex Dual Diagnosis – the significance of which was not appreciated and therefore not managed adequately or appropriately;
3. In any event, even on the basis upon which community care was deemed appropriate, there was an absence of any co-ordination between mental health service provision and addiction services;
4. There was an absence of any adequate ""Care Programme Approach"" (a package of care used to plan mental health care) resulting in no care coordinator being appointed to monitor the deceased within the auspices of an appropriate care plan;
5. Inadequate evaluation of the deceased's previous history; his purported non-concordance (repeated assertions of not wanting treatment/support that ought to have been interpreted as an increase in his risk); progression of his complex vulnerabilities; his personal circumstances (reaction to accommodation and relationships); events suggestive of on-going misuse of drugs - all gave rise to a missed opportunities to appreciate a series of ascertainable relapse signatures;
6. The absence of any ""assertive outreach"" to the deceased when discharged into the community (that is to say, no face to contact, no alternative welfare checks being organised, undue reliance being placed on the informal supervisory role of the landlord or other agencies) gave rise to a total disconnect between patient and healthcare provider, thereby creating a series of missed opportunities to assess the deceased, identify possible relapse signatures and potentially escalate care;

a. The lack of interface between senior or experienced care providers to deal with multi-faceted or nuanced cases;

The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 5 August 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,"The deceased had a fall at home on 02/01/20 causing a scalp laceration which required hospital treatment. Further assessment in out-patients confirmed he needed surgery to repair the wound which was undertaken on 10/01/20. Post-surgery he remained in hospital and developed delirium which gradually settled. He had an assessment by the occupational therapist on the 21 and 22 January 2020 at which he was orientated, did not appear confused, could manage his personal care and could perform simple tasks. Consequently, he was discharged home on 24/01/20. Following discharge, he appeared less independent than prior to his admission, he was more confused, he suffered another fall, although he showed no sign of any significant injury, and became anxious and concerned about his medications. On 27/01/20 he was found hanging from the bannister of the stairs at his residence and was declared deceased at 07.39.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:
1(a) HANGING","1. Dr. [REDACTED], Consultant Geriatrician, made a change to Mr. Cooney’s prescriptions for Amitriptyline and Nitrazepam. Although the fact of the change and the rationale for it were explained in “general terms” to Mr. Cooney at the time of the review on 21 January 2020 and set out in the discharge summary, nothing was communicated to Mr. Cooney’s daughter and next of kin, Ms [REDACTED], who also held lasting power of attorney for him. Following his discharge on Friday 24 January 2020, Ms [REDACTED] realised that the dose of Amitriptyline and Nitrazepam dispensed was half the usual dose. Mr. Cooney, who had dementia, had been found during his admission to lack capacity and had suffered multifactorial delirium during the admission, did not know why he only had half the expected dose of these medications, he did not recall the change and became anxious about it. It was agreed that they would contact his GP on Monday 27 January to ask for a review of the medications. As Ms [REDACTED] had not been informed of the decision and the reason for it she could not explain it to her father and/or provide reassurance. Unfortunately, Mr. Cooney ended his life during the early hours of 27 January. Mr. Cooney’s suicide note included “I tried to sort the tablets out but couldn’t”

2. For patients with a cognitive impairment there is a risk that if changes to medication made during an inpatient stay are not communicated directly to those caring for them, confusion will arise which could result in the medication being erroneously omitted or overdose.

3. Dr. [REDACTED] acknowledged that if Mr. Cooney had been a patient on the Geriatric Wards, rather than a plastic surgery patient, she would have communicated the fact and reason for change to Ms. [REDACTED] directly. She said she did not do so in this case because, as a Consultant providing an opinion for a patient under the care of another team, she did not view it as her responsibility.

4. Dr. [REDACTED] said that her practice had now changed, and she would always communicate such a decision to the NOK of a patient with a cognitive impairment. She was also aware that the facts of this case would be raised with other geriatricians within the Trust. However, it was not clear that this awareness will result in consideration of a new instruction/procedure that for all patients with dementia and/or significant cognitive impairment, any changes to medications made during an inpatient stay should be communicated to the NOK/carer by the clinician making the change regardless of the capacity in which they come to be reviewing the patient.

The inquest was concluded on 24 June 2020. The medical cause of death was: 1a Cardiac Arrhythmia 1b Amitriptyline and Nortriptyline overdose. II Coronary Artery Disease. The conclusion as to the death was Suicide.","Mr Etherington was recorded in February 2019 as having antisocial personality traits and a long history of cocaine use. He was arrested in April 2018 for threats to his ex-wife, had a Mental Health Act Assessment which did not secure her history about extreme mood changes, paranoid behaviour, auditory hallucinations and delusions, which were probably psychotic. His behaviour was then ascribed to substance misuse; it is also recorded that he denied using cocaine for 6 months. In July he was assessed by a Mental Health Trust who elicited a history of auditory hallucinations of two voices to end his life, thoughts about wanting to kill himself all of the time and an admission that his wife says that he sees people who are not there and talks to them. Protective factors from suicide were noted and he was discharged to his GP. He was provided with temporary accommodation and his wife and friend provided other accommodation and he then also slept in his van. He did not qualify for priority housing by the local authority. He went missing on 20 November. He had stolen his wife’s Amitriptyline and taken an overdose, and was found dead in his van.","1. The fact that the deceased was under a restriction order not to contact his ex-wife was cited as a reason that no contact was made by the professionals conducting the MHA assessment. This may raise some process issues but would not seem to be an obstacle to securing corroborative evidence and insight into possible psychosis, especially noting the deceased gave no indication that he opposed such a communication.

2. The witness evidence heard and records consulted give the impression that those professionals involved in his care had discounted his symptoms as non-psychotic, without adequate investigation, underestimated his suicidality and not addressed the concerns of the GP who referred him about his management, and to whom his care passed without any psychiatric follow up or support.

3. Neither failure was recognised or investigated by the Root Cause Analysis which was described as Level 2 Comprehensive and concluded that there were no problems in health care.

Topping,Surrey,"Philip Astle, Chief Executive, South East Coast Ambulance Service; The Chief Constable, Surrey County Constabulary","The inquest was opened on 28 November 2017 and resumed before a coroner with jury on 4 February 2020. It concluded on 18 February 2020 and the jury returned a narrative conclusion as follows:

Karen first came into contact with the Mental Health Services on 13/10/2014, when referred to Waverley CMHRS after an overdose. In March 2015 she was diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. The personality disorder is characterised by a highly unpredictable, rapidly changing emotional state, suicidal ideation with risk of self-harm. In Karen's case this was exacerbated by alcohol.

Karen's mental disorder was also exacerbated by being the defendant in harassment proceedings and by her perception of being let down by the Criminal Justice System. On occasion, contact with the police and Criminal Justice System triggered self-injurious behaviours.

Karen had made a perjury allegation, and the CIO officer investigating this allegation was aware of the above triggers.

On 09/10/2017, Karen called police saying she was going to hang herself. Police officers attended her home within 20 minutes and cut her down from a noose. Karen had been drinking and going through her legal paperwork and was found standing on a bannister, with a noose around her neck. Karen spoke to the attending police constable about her legal investigations including the perjury allegation.

The attending police constable raised concerns that Karen was at high risk of suicide, especially if the ongoing legal investigations did not give her the result she had hoped for. The PC attempted to escalate this concern using a 39:24, an LOI marker, and an email addressed to the CID detective sergeant, the detective constable investigating the perjury allegation, and the Surrey Police Professional Standards Department.

The CIO investigating officer and detective sergeant did not follow Surrey Police protocol which required them to involve partner organisations (SABP) when dealing with Karen. They did however decide that news about the perjury investigation should be conveyed in person.

On 18 November 2017, the CIO investigating officer accompanied by a colleague attended Karen's address, [REDACTED], Farnham, having arranged for Karen's friend to also be present. Karen was informed that her perjury allegation was being filed due to lack of evidence. The officers left Karen with her friend. Both officers felt that Karen was ok and had taken the news better than expected. Karen's friend also felt she was ok and left her alone around 15:15.

During the afternoon of 18/11/17, after her friend left, Karen consumed some alcohol and sent an email at 16:05 to the CID investigating officer discussing her legal case and thanking the officer for her investigation. It is unclear when this email was drafted. It was entitled 'Final Statement' and closed with the words 'none of it matters anymore. This is what she wanted'. Karen's intent in sending this email is unclear and it was not read by the officer until much later.

At 16:15, Karen called the police on 101 and told the switchboard that she had been trying to hang herself and had broken her hand. The police contact centre called her back and although Karen assured the call handler that she was ok and did not require assistance, the call handler felt that an emergency ambulance and police response was required.

At 17:43 the ambulance crew arrived and were let into the property by Karen's friend who had just arrived. Karen's friend entered the house with the ambulance crew and Karen was found hanging from the loft hatch. Her knees were bent with her feet trailing on the floor behind her.

The paramedics attempted to resuscitate Karen, however she was asystolic, cyanosed and could not be revived. The critical care paramedic called ROLE (Recognition of Life Extinct) at 17:59 on 18 November 2017.

Matters the jury finds are probably causative:
In respect of the safeguarding plan put in place when telling Karen about the outcome of the perjury investigation on 18 November 2017:

1. Sufficient information was not obtained to inform safeguarding plan.
2. There was a failure to invite SABP to contribute to the plan.
3. There was a failure to put Karen's lay supporter on notice of the purpose of the visit on 18 November 2017, the concerns about Karen's reaction, and to discuss any role that person was expected to play in the safeguarding plan.
4. There was a failure to put in place an adequate multi-agency safeguarding plan.

Matters the jury finds are possibly causative, not found established on the balance of probabilities:
1. There was a lack of knowledge among police officers involved with Karen regarding how and when to add and update Location of Interest and warning markers on NICHE, PNC and ICAD.
2. The failure to add recent sufficient information to these markers possibly compromised the ability of the police contact centre and force control room to make an informed decision on 18/11/17.
3. It is possible that, had accurate up to date information been recorded, a Grade 1 police response might have been dispatched, despite Karen's assurances to the police call handler that she was now ok.
4. Had a Grade 1 police response been dispatched it could possibly have materially affected the outcome.

The jury concludes Karen met her death by accident.

The cause of death was

1a Hanging",,"The evidence showed that:

1. Police training in respect of mental health does not provide information as to the type of behaviours associated with common mental health conditions.
2. Those responsible for the dispatch of emergency services in the police and ambulance services do not have a sufficient understanding of the triaging and dispatching processes used by each other's service nor their response times.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

1a) Hanging

The inquest conclusion was suicide.","On 10 October 2019, the deceased was found dead at his home address, having used a rope as a ligature to hang himself. The deceased left goodbye notes expressing his intentions.

The deceased suffered from anxiety and depression and was receiving active treatment for these conditions. On 30 July 2019, the deceased's family sought help from the crisis team following concerns for his welfare. The assessing clinician did not create any contemporaneous records of the telephone consultation which took place but it is accepted that the family was informed that as the deceased had capacity to make decisions and did not wish to engage with this service, no interventions could take place. The family were advised to contact the police if they had any welfare concerns.

On 6 September 2019, the deceased saw his General Practitioner, complaining of low mood. During the assessment, he did not make any mention of any active thoughts to end his own life. The deceased had contact with the police on 2 and 7 October 2019, where no concerns were recorded about any suicidal thoughts. This is disputed by the family and from the evidence heard it is not possible to resolve this factual dispute.","During the inquest, evidence was heard that:

i. There should be better interagency working and sharing of key information between agencies who had contact with the deceased in the period leading up to his death.

""Mr Thiago Vieira Strazzeri De Araujo deliberately ingested [REDACTED] on 5 February 2020 which caused his death. Mr Araujo had been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder which exhibited itself in; a preoccupation with death, emotional dysregulation, high risk behaviour, and at times - suicidal thoughts. Mr Araujo received community psychiatric care at the time of his death, he had disengaged from that care and consequently, there is no contemporary medical assessment of his mental state. In the days prior to his death he was observed by his family to suffer from psychotic delusions. It is not possible to satisfactorily determine his state of mind at the time of his death""

The medical cause of death was;

1a [REDACTED]",On 5 February 2020 Mr Thiago Araujo was found deceased at his mother's home address. It was determined that Mr Araujo had consumed [REDACTED] which caused his death.,"1. On 24 January 2020 Mr Araujo had discharged himself from psychiatric inpatient care he was to be supervised by the Camden and Islington NHS Trust crisis team. Mr Araujo failed to engage with the crisis team and following a meeting on 30 January 2020 the crisis team closed Mr Araujo’s referral. In the course of this closure no arrangements were made to address the risks presented by Mr Araujo.

2. Following Mr Araujo’s death it has become clear that the closure of his case by the crisis team was not permanent, and had Mr Araujo or his family approached the crisis team to reopen his case, steps could have been taken to reinstate crisis team support. Mr Araujo’s family were unaware of this facility.

3. Family and carers of patients diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder do not receive support or education upon management of this diagnosis from Camden and Islington NHS Trust, unless the patient has been received for treatment by the personality disorder service.

4. By 4 February 2020 the Camden and Islington community recovery team identified an acute risk of suicide in Mr Araujo, faced with his non-compliance with community treatment they considered an admission into inpatient care. No actions were taken to affect this plan.

5. In evidence the community recovery team indicated that a factor in their inaction was the knowledge that arranging a section 135 Mental Health Act 1983 warrant and assessment would take two weeks. Such an assessment requires actions by an approved mental health practitioner from the local authority, two section 12 Mental Health Act approved doctors, the assistance of the Metropolitan Police and the local magistrates court to secure a warrant. A delay of 14 days in securing a Mental Health Act assessment is in my opinion unacceptable.

6. In the days leading to Mr Araujo’s death his family became aware that he had made an online purchase of [REDACTED] which was to be delivered to his father’s home.

From around 1999, David had developed problems with both illicit drugs and alcohol consumption. In or around 2003, David suffered a significant brain injury due to an assault. That brain injury caused or seriously exacerbated a Personality Disorder. The combination of the brain injury and Personality Disorder meant that David was impulsive and his alcohol and drug misuse problems became more extensive and difficult to manage.

In April 2017, David was referred to and accepted for specialist rehabilitation at the Transitional Rehabilitation Unit (“TRU”), which was funded by the local Clinical Commissioning Group. At this stage, David was resident at Newton Unit (a locked rehabilitation unit) and detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983. He later spent time at Lowton Unit (an open rehabilitation ward) before moving to Ashton Cross on the 12 March 2018. Ashton Cross was a pre-community placement. David remained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 but had been granted section 17 leave with a condition that he reside at Ashton Cross.

Throughout his time at TRU, David received significant therapeutic input including help with problem solving and impulsivity, counselling and planning. There were periods where David showed improvement and other periods where he would abscond from the various units and consume alcohol and illicit drugs.

On the 18 December 2018, an inappropriate decision was taken (following a Multidisciplinary Disciplinary Team Meeting (“MDT”)) that David’s “section 3” (and parasitic “section 17” provisions) would be removed. It was the view of the instructed expert Psychiatrist that the “section” should not have been lifted until there was a plan in place regarding his community placement and care going forward.

As a result of the decision of the Responsible Clinician at the MDT, David became a resident at Ashton Cross with no legal framework in place and with no community plan in place for his future.

The views of David’s family were not sought prior to the decision to lift the section on the 18 December 2018. Further, David’s family was not invited to attend the MDT meeting on the 18 December 2018.

David left Ashton Cross on the 20 December 2018 and was returned by police on the 23 December 2018. David had consumed alcohol and drugs during this period and been arrested for a criminal offence. His behaviour was escalating but the lack of any legal framework meant that TRU had limited control over him.

On the 26 December 2018, David left Ashton Cross at 1.30 pm with the intention of placing a bet on the races. He was a voluntary client at Ashton Cross and was entitled to come and go as he pleased. At approximately 3 pm David fell backwards from a motorway bridge at junction 24 of the M6 from the A58 (Liverpool Road). In the moments prior to taking those actions, David likely formed an intention to end his own life by falling from the bridge. He had not formed any specific intention to end his own life prior to that.

David died as a consequence of multiple injuries sustained after he fell from a motorway bridge, with the intention of ending his own life. The inappropriate decision to revoke his detention under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (eight days prior to his death) likely contributed to his death. This was the evidence of Professor Shaw, expert Psychiatrist. I accepted her evidence on that point.

Further, there was a failure to invite David’s family to that MDT meeting (8 days prior to his death) but this did not contribute to David’s death.","In David’s case, no steps were taken to invite [REDACTED] (or any other family member) to the MDT meeting on 18 December 2018 when the decision was made by the Responsible Clinician to remove David from the confines of section 3 (and section 17) of the Mental Health Act 1983. It is a requirement of the Mental Health Act 1983 that the nearest relative is informed. Further, family views were not sought regarding the decision to lift the section in any other way. At the inquest, staff remained unclear between themselves as to whose responsibility it was to inform the family.

Whilst I was informed that a policy has been drafted and is in the process of being ratified, it remained the case that there was no formal policy in place covering contact with families in respect of the above decisions and/or in respect of inviting family members to MDTs more generally. I was further concerned that there was ongoing confusion between witnesses (in particular the Acting Manager and the Responsible Clinician) as to who is tasked with informing the family of MDTs and of any potential decision to remove a “section”.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,Secretary of State for Health; Chief Executive of Tameside and Glossop Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG); Chief Executive of Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust; Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership,On 11 June 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Steven Keith Marsland. The investigation concluded on 18 November 2019 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) hanging,"Steven Marsland had a complex mental health background. He was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for bipolar disorder which had led to a manic episode with psychotic symptoms. On 9 April 2019 he was discharged from the Section 3 and was to reside in the community with support from the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). He was prescribed sodium valproate. There was one follow up face-to-face meeting with the CMHT on 15 April 2019. There were 4 telephone conversations with the CMHT between discharge and his death on 10 June 2019.

On 31 May 2019 he cancelled his appointment for a face-to-face meeting. A further meeting was not arranged. The CMHT did not engage with his family following his discharge from his Section 3. A follow up outpatient appointment with a psychiatrist was not made after his discharge. His family felt he was more withdrawn. On 10 June 2019 he was found suspended from a ligature in a wooded area adjacent to Ashton Golf Club. It was a location known to him through family fishing outings. There were no suspicious circumstances or evidence of third party involvement.","1. The inquest heard that his family were very supportive and had attended MDT meetings whilst he was an in-patient. Following his discharge there was no attempt to engage his family and obtain information from them or work with them to support him in the community. There was no clear policy about how a family could be effectively engaged by the CMHT;

2. The inquest heard that he was treated as an in-patient by the Pennine Care team within Stockport MBC. His consultant whilst he was an in-patient was part of the Stockport Team. If he had been a Stockport Resident he would have been discharged under the care of that consultant in the community and had a follow up appointment booked with that Doctor at discharge. However because he was a Tameside Resident at discharge his care moved to the Tameside Borough Pennine Care Team. That meant he had to be allocated to a community psychiatrist based there. That did not happen and no follow up appointment was made;

3. The inquest heard that it was recognised as part of his discharge planning that there should be regular contact in the community with the CMHT. That did not happen and there was no escalation or discussion about the picture of very limited contact as it evolved post discharge.",True,False,False,True,True,False,True,False

Carney,Gateshead and South Tyneside,"North East Ambulance Service, NHS Foundation Trust; Northumbria Police Service; Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Trust",On 16 November 2018 commenced an investigation into the death of MAUREEN WHARTON aged 61. The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not yet been heard.,"On Thursday 15 November 2018 at 20:45 Maureen contacted 999 ambulance services.
She stated that she was dying of cancer and that she wanted to end her life now.
She stated she had taken a quantity of medication including Tramadol, Zopiclone and other prescribed medication and she claimed she was still taking them.
She claimed to be in possession of paracetamol but had not taken these yet
She stated she suffered from depression and had previously overdosed.
At 21:12 Maureen again contacted the Ambulance Service, confirming the same previous detail given. She stated she was not “worse”. She appeared slightly more drowsy but was able to communicate.
At 00:10 an ambulance was assigned to the incident and arrived at Maureen’s flat at 00:17.
Entry was eventually gained to the flat at 00:30.
Maureen was deceased
A subsequent post mortem examination confirmed death was attributable to “the combined effects of Tramadol, Venlafaxine, Zopiclone and alcohol","The investigation of the circumstances of the death has focused amongst other aspects on the control communications between Maureen and ambulance control personnel with particular reference to the detail of the actual conversations had between Maureen and the personnel, the method of evaluating and grading of information elicited from Maureen in that process.
It is correct to acknowledge the NEAS is still undertaking its own investigation and evaluation of these matters with a view to publishing a report before the end of the current year, concerns have been identified around apparent missed opportunities to react in a different or more timely manner to the facts and detail being presented in the course of these calls.

Central to these concerns are that a period of 3.45 hours elapsed between the first call and the arrival of an ambulance crew at Maureen’s side. Whilst explanations around lack of resources and even possibly inadvertent allocation and/or interpretation of data may feature in the NEAS subsequent report by way of explanation of this delay, the real and imminent danger of Maureen’s admitted actions does not appear to have been appreciated and readily reacted to in a meaningful way given the danger they clearly presented.
An apparent toxicological aid was either unappreciated or misinterpreted as an under assessed and immediate event - the need was obvious

a) No enquiry was made of Maureen as to the nature of her location and the potential support or assistance readily at hand or otherwise.
b) No further enquiries were made to identify familial or social support which might or could have been enlisted or alerted to her presenting danger
c) No NEAS protocol appears to exist to assist personnel to initiate a response other than one limited to and directing an ambulance allocation
d) No working arrangement appears to exist to enlist the aid of other agencies to support the patient or react more directly and in timely way to monitor and evaluate the nature of the presenting danger.

There appears to be a need for a closer liaison and working relationship between emergency services which is sufficiently robust to react and present early support to the patient there having been such an accurate evaluation of an otherwise obvious developing critical situation and particularly if delays in reaction otherwise may also be apparent.",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Hassell,London Inner North,"Ms Angela McNab, Chief Executive, Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust (C&I); Commissioner Cressida Dick, Metropolitan Police Service (MPS)","On 4 February 2019, one of my assistant coroners, William Dolman, commenced an investigation into the death of Nimo Younis aged 37 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 November 2019. The jury made a narrative determination at inquest, a copy of which I attach.","Nimo Younis was detained in the psychiatric intensive care unit of St Pancras Hospital under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. She was granted unescorted leave from Ruby Ward at 6pm on 24 January 2019, with an agreement to return at 8pm. She did not.

The following day between 6.35pm and 8.48pm (when she was found at the home of a friend by police), she hanged herself.","When Nimo Younis did not return to the ward as agreed at 8pm on 24 January, her absence was quickly noted. From 9.32pm that evening, a series of telephone conversations took place between Camden & Islington NHS Trust (C&I) Ruby Ward staff and the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), but there was police classification of a high risk missing person and consequent action only at approximately 5pm the following day. Thus she was not found before she hanged herself.

1. C&I ward staff did not have a proper understanding of what action the MPS would take in what circumstances, following the report of a patient absent without leave.

2. C&I ward staff did not have a proper understanding of what action the MPS required others to take in order to prompt the police to progress the matter further.

3. C&I ward staff did not have a practical plan as to how to take that action with the resources at their disposal.

4. C&I ward staff did not have a proper understanding of what key information they needed to provide the MPS in order to trigger a police missing person enquiry, or to escalate an existing enquiry.

5. C&I ward staff did not promptly or fully utilise the significant potential of their patient’s friends, who were ultimately the route by which Nimo Younis was found, and who would certainly have acted sooner if they had appreciated the lack of action being taken - whatever the reason for that lack of action.

6. The MPS decision makers, particularly the night time duty inspector, did not have all the information that the MPS held when they were making decisions. Evidence was given that this was a resourcing issue on that particular night and of course it is difficult to legislate for that, but creative thinking may be utilised to address such an issue.

7. Whether or not there is agreement between the MPS and any trust about who should be doing what, there must be a clarity about what information the MPS needs in order to make the best decisions and what action the MPS will then take.

If the situation preceding Nimo Younis's death is to be avoided in the future, the MPS needs to set out its position simply and clearly, and the trust needs to ensure that all relevant staff truly understand the position and are equipped to act accordingly.

This needs to include a recognition that different organisations may have different definitions of the same terms.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
3050,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/katie-croft/,2019-0393,2019-11-19,A. Mutch,Greater Manchester South,College of Policing; Secretary of State for Education; Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,On 17 January 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Katie Croft. The investigation concluded on 17 October 2019 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) Severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy; 1b) Asphyxia from hanging,"Katie Croft was a vulnerable child who was a victim of abuse which she reported. On 17 October 2018 Greater Manchester Police and Tameside Children’s Services began an investigation. Katie was spoken to by both agencies having already given a detailed account to her school, which had reported the disclosure. The working together principles applied to the investigation which require that the voice of the child should be a focus for all agencies.

Subsequently Katie via her mother indicated she did not want to support a prosecution. The case was closed by Greater Manchester Police without being countersigned by a supervisor or any further face to face discussion with Katie or assessment of the evidence. A multi-agency strategy meeting was held and concluded Katie was being safeguarded. A child and family assessment was subsequently completed by an agency social worker from Children’s Services without any further discussion with Katie. It was not shared with Katie or her family.

On 18 December 2018 Katie disclosed to her form teacher that she was considering self-harm or worse. A cause for concern form was completed but subsequently misplaced. Action was taken to notify her parents of Katie’s disclosure and her mother was spoken to. Katie had previously self-harmed. No further action was taken in relation to this disclosure. On 8 January 2019 Katie sent her previous form teacher, who had left the school, a message via social media. She said she had no one else to talk to who knew what she was feeling and that she thought about the abuse every day and had cut herself the day before. The message was shared with the school safeguarding lead that evening and Katie was spoken to at school the following day. She denied sending the message.

She continued with lessons. School attempted to notify her family of the concern. After school she returned home. As a result of concerns raised by one of her friends school were contacted and contact was made with her family who tried to contact her and check on her wellbeing. Her friend went to check on her and found Katie suspended from a ligature at her home address.

She was resuscitated and taken to hospital. However she had sustained catastrophic brain damage and died at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital on 15 January 2019.","1. The inquest was told that GMP followed their own guidance which accorded with that of the College of Policing into the level of expertise of the officer allocated to investigate Katie’s allegations. As a result of this the case was not dealt with by an experienced Public Protection or specialist sexual offences trained officer. It was allocated to a probationary police constable with approximately 6 months experience. The officer did not seize the phone which contained key social media contents until her third visit on the initial evening the offence was disclosed. The allocated officer was not experienced in joint working with social services or familiar with the concept of the voice of the child and what it would mean in such a case. At the time the decision was made by police to NFA matters there was no discussion about whether there could be a victimless prosecution; it was not established if the initial account was recorded on body worn footage or the extent of the social media contact by the suspect and the nature of any offences that could be revealed by those messages. No attempt was made to have a further face to face conversation with Katie;

2. The Local Authority at the time were using a substantial number of agency social workers. As a result the Child and Family Assessment was not completed in accordance with best practice and not shared in accordance with expectations around best practice. The Local Authority has since made significant progress in moving away from a reliance on agency staff to fill gaps in social work cover. The inquest was told that agency social workers are still used extensively in other Local Authorities creating a risk that a similar situation could arise;

3. At the safeguarding strategy meeting an officer allocated to attend such meetings on behalf of GMP attended rather than an officer allocated to the case. As a result the quality of information sharing and understanding of the allegation was more limited. On the particular police division in question this practice has stopped. It was unclear how common the approach is on a wider basis;

4. It was accepted by witnesses for both the Local Authority and GMP that the voice of the child was not fully heard throughout their investigations. They via the safeguarding board commissioned an independent report whose findings and recommendations have been fully adopted by the safeguarding board. It was unclear what if any steps would be taken to disseminate the lessons pan GM or nationally;

5. A further concern identified was that there was no mechanism for the school to be formally be aware of information within the Child and Family Assessment. As a result there was no formal follow-up procedure set out in the best practice national guidance the school was working within. The inquest heard that Katie’s school recognising this gap has built on the working together guidance to develop guidance that ensures there is a proactive approach to engaging with a child and their family post the writing of a Child and Family Assessment;

6. On the day Katie committed suicide she had attended a GCSE English class. The exam board required poetry syllabus was being studied that day. The lesson included a poem where the contextualisation of it included the use of suicide. The teacher delivering the lesson had no way of understanding the history of self-harm of Katie and her particular vulnerability when delivering a set text in accordance with the exam board requirements. It was unclear what if any guidance is given by the exam board to assist teachers minimising risk to pupils in this scenario.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Brown,Birmingham and Solihull,Friendship Care and Housing Limited (Longhurst Group),On 22/05/2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mary Josephine Hoare. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 12 November 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased died due to a fall from height as a result of deliberately climbing over her balcony rail. Her intentions at the time are not known.,"The Deceased died at 21:11 on 16 May 2019 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital due to catastrophic injuries she sustained when she deliberately climbed over the balcony of her 2nd floor apartment at Phoenix House in Shirley falling to the ground below. Phoenix House provided independent living accommodation for the over 55s with the availability of extra care as required. Mrs. Hoare was receiving twice daily visits to supervise and administer her medication. Mrs. Hoare had moved into Phoenix House on 6 May 2019 from Blenheim Hall, a residential care home to which she had been admitted on 4 April 2019 after being discharged from the Juniper Psychiatric Centre at Moseley Hall Hospital.

Mrs. Hoare had been detained for treatment and assessment under section 2 of the Mental Health Act on 27 December 2018 due to severe depression, emerging paranoid ideation and suicidal thoughts. Mrs. Hoare responded to medical management and no longer required inpatient treatment by the end of March 2019 but she had declined cognitively and was no longer capable of living independently. However, there was no formal discharge meeting before Mrs. Hoare was discharged and consequently it was not made clear to her family that the mental health team regarded an independent living setting as unsuitable. Relevant information about Mrs. Hoare’s recent mental health history and stay at Blenheim Hall was not disclosed as part of her application process to Phoenix House. There were also missed opportunities to assess her overall suitability to live at Phoenix House and to determine the appropriate level of extra care she required. Consequently, although the move to Phoenix House was made with good intentions, it was not a suitable setting for Mrs. Hoare. It is not known why Mrs. Hoare climbed over the balcony. She had suffered from suicidal ideation in the past but had given no indication of a real or immediate risk of suicide and she could become confused.

Based on information from the Deceased’s treating clinicians the medical cause of death was determined to be:
1a) Diffuse axonal injury
1b) Pericardial haematoma
1c) Traumatic haemo pneumothorax","1. In April 2019, and currently, Friendship Care and Housing Limited (‘FCH’), who provide care at Phoenix House, and the Solihull Care Housing Association Limited (‘SCHA’), are reliant upon information from the applicant and their family when assessing the suitability of a privately funded applicant to become a resident.
2. Due to their changing circumstances and/or health, applicants and their families are not always well placed to be realistic about what the applicant’s needs and risks are. Therefore there is a risk that full and accurate information will not be provided to FCH and SCHA.
3. In this case, the family of Mrs. Hoare assert that they were not made aware by Mental Health Teams that she was not suitable for independent living and they always genuinely thought that she was. For whatever reason, full information that was known to the applicant and family about Mrs. Hoare’s mental health history was not included on her application form or given in the assessment meeting held on 5 April 2019. Specifically the assessors were not aware of Mrs. Hoare’s recent treatment under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, nor that she continued to be under the care of the Community Mental Health Team (‘CMHT’), nor were staff informed on 5 April 2019 that she was resident in a care home at the time of the meeting.
4. Phoenix House and other settings where FCH provide care do not routinely ask for information from applicants’ General Practitioners to obtain independent current medical information. It was discussed at inquest that there are various proportionate ways this information could be sought with the consent of the applicant.
5. At assessment a full service users’ assessment was not completed for Mrs. Hoare by the FCH assessor which would have been an opportunity to ask more searching questions of the applicant and her family.
6. As a consequence of the above, Mrs. Hoare became a resident of Phoenix House when she was not suitable. If information regarding her recent mental health history, ongoing management and care home residency had come to light before Mrs. Hoare became a resident it would not necessarily have prevented her being offered a unit at Phoenix House but it would have resulted in enquiries with the CMHT, her GP and potentially the care home she was in at the time of assessment. It was my conclusion that on a balance of probabilities with adequate investigations before taking up residence, it would have been determined that Mrs. Hoare could not be accommodated at that time in an independent living setting.
7. Once Mrs. Hoare was a resident, a care plan and risk assessments were not completed.
8. At inquest, evidence was given that improvements have already been made by FCH and SCHA to elicit more information from initial application forms but whilst consideration is being given to seeking information from an applicant’s GP for all privately funded applicants, a decision has not yet been made. Further whilst instruction has been given to the staff members involved in this case on the importance of completing full assessments prior to and post admission, no formal training or written admission process for staff carrying out assessment across all of FCH’s supported living services has been introduced.
9. Therefore it continues to be a concern that applicants may be accepted to FCH supported living settings who have not been fully assessed and who are not suitable, putting their lives at risk.",True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False

Mr Spooner was found unresponsive in his bedroom having suffocated himself with the intention of ending his life at approximately 8:00pm on 31 August 2018. Mr Spooner was taken to hospital by ambulance on an emergency basis with ongoing resuscitation efforts but these were unsuccessful.","1) There was a lack of multi-agency information sharing, co-operation, co-ordination and effective communication both within and between health care providers which meant that:

a) The private counsellor who provided treatment to Mr Spooner did not have adequate information from other health care providers as to his medical/mental health history, diagnosis and treatment by other healthcare professionals.

b) There was a failure to adopt an effective multi-agency approach to the care for Mr Spooner from 20 August 2018 when it was known that he was actively considering ending his life.

c) There was a failure to adequately intervene from 30 August 2018 when it was known that: (1) Mr Spooner had recently attempted to take his life; and (2) Mr Spooner had subsequently undertaken additional research and made further preparations to enable him to do so.

2) There was an excessive and unreasonable reliance placed upon Mr Spooner’s family by health care providers to keep him safe when those providers knew that Mr Spooner’s family were not in a position to do so. Health care providers lacked awareness of and/or failed to adequately involve other agencies who may have been able to keep Mr Spooner safe, for example the police who may have been able to exercise their powers under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to take Mr Spooner to a place of safety.",False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False

I understand this is now less likely to occur in Carlisle and would be generally desirable. I am concerned that agencies to whom a patient is discharged and families or friends [with consent] who will need to be supportive are not routinely involved in the discharge process.

Ceara Marie Thacker died as a result of suicide

Ceara Marie Thacker died from:

Ia Compression of the neck (due to)
b Hanging","Ceara Marie Thacker was a 19 year old young lady who moved from Bradford to Liverpool in September 2017 to attend the University of Liverpool. Up until the age of 16 Ceara had been under Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Bradford. Throughout her teenage years Ceara self-harmed. On 11 May 2018 Ceara was found deceased hanging [REDACTED]. The toxicological analysis revealed the presence of alcohol (175mg – blood). Ceara’s first contact with mental health services in Liverpool was with the Primary Care Service, Talk Liverpool, in September 2017. Ceara registered with a GP in Liverpool on 30 September 2017. On 3 October 2017 Ceara presented herself at the Accident and Emergency department of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital with suicidal ideation and was low in mood. During the assessment in the Royal Liverpool University Hospital (RLUH) a mental state examination was completed which concluded Ceara was low and anxious, however had no current plan or intent to end her life, citing her family and friends as protective factors. The plan developed was for Ceara to see her G.P. to review her treatment, she was provided information and was signposted to Young Persons Advisory Service (YPAS). On 23 October 2017 Ceara saw the GP and discussed her anxiety and depression, she was noted to be coping mostly well but stated she could sometimes get very low. On 21 February 2018, Ceara attended the Royal Hospital accident and emergency department having overdosed on paracetamol and ibuprofen and once medically fit she was assessed by the mental health practitioner. During the assessment Ceara stated she had been struggling and her level of self-harm had increased but was unable to identify a trigger. Ceara was given similar advice again to when she attended the Accident and Emergency Department in October 2017. Ceara stated she found it difficult to take the medication and that it was not effective and did not like the way it made her feel. She was advised to discuss this with her G.P. who could discuss alternatives. The assessment noted that Ceara’s self-harm had increased in frequency and concluded that she had taken an impulsive overdose and she regretted taking the overdose. Despite stating she had good friends the note of the assessment later stated that friends were unaware and that she didn’t feel she knew them well enough to talk about her difficulties (the assessment was never sent to the GP but this was a separate issue explored at the Inquest). On 13 February 2018 Ceara completed and dated a self-referral form to the Mental Health Advisory team, a service based in the University of Liverpool and supplementary to the NHS mental health services, but only sent the form to them on 22 February 2018, the day after she had taken the overdose. This referral was triaged on 26 March 2018 and an appointment then offered for 24 April 2018 (the delay of the appointment was a separate issue explored at the inquest). In this meeting she mentioned similar things to those mentioned in previous meetings. Ceara was not deemed to be of immediate risk. On 24 March 2018 Ceara completed a second self-referral to Talk Liverpool and was offered a telephone assessment for 10 April 2018. This was carried out by a cognitive behavioural therapist. This assessment concluded that Ceara presented as quite vulnerable and impulsive and reached the conclusion that Ceara was not suitable for cognitive therapy behaviour therapy and referred her to a secondary service, the Single Point Access (SPA) team for a full mental health assessment. The referral to SPA team was received on the same day and was triaged the next day on 12 April 2018. The assessment is based upon the information on the referral and at a multi-disciplinary team meeting it was deemed suitable for a routine appointment namely in 6 weeks and Ceara was sent an appointment for 18 May 2018. Ceara did not attend this appointment as she died on 11 May 2018.","1. Throughout Ceara’s involvement with the medical professionals and therapists, whether by Mersey Care, Mental Health Advisory team at the University or the GPs there is no evidence of any discussion around involving Ceara’s family in drawing up a plan or consideration of requesting consent from Ceara to discuss her situation with parents/family. It is accepted that Ceara was an adult and had full capacity, however, Ceara was a young adult, first time away from home who had history of mental health issues. It would have been helpful to have had these discussions so that if Ceara wanted that additional support from her family this could have been facilitated. That said it is unclear as to whether Ceara would have agreed to her family being involved, however, this line of enquiry would have been helpful.

The general approach with young people appears to be to encourage them to discuss their issues with their parents/family rather than asking for consent for the professionals to discuss it with the parents/family.

2. Concern was raised that once Ceara was found hanging, no attempts were made to cut her down. The pathologist gave evidence to the effect it would be difficult to say how quick the death would have occurred, however, there was a very small window after the hanging where a person could survive, be it with brain damage. He stated it was rare that an individual was not cut down. The Residential Adviser who found Ceara had received first aid training but this did not include anything in relation to hangings.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Marsh,"Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton",British Telecom (“BT”); Hampshire Constabulary; South Central Ambulance Service,"On 23 April 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of William James Moody, aged 85. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 September 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Moody had died as a result of suicide (by entering the River Itchen via the banks of his home address on 19 April 2019). The medical cause of his death was given as drowning.","On the 18 April 2019, Mr Moody drove himself from his home in Bishopstoke to Wimbourne and, once there, called his family to express his intention to end his life. He was intercepted by the police who detained him under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1996 and took him to a place of safety (St Ann’s Hospital in Poole) where he was the subject of an assessment by a consultant psychiatrist. He was not deemed to be detainable and so was released.
On the following day, the 19 April 2019, Mr Moody entered the banks of the River Itchen. The river runs through the gardens/grounds of the estate on which Mr Moody lived in a cottage. He intentionally entered the river to end his life. He was taken by paramedics to Southampton General Hospital where it was not possible to revive him.","At Mr Moody’s inquest I heard that his family (who were present throughout events as his daughter and son-in-law own the estate in which Mr and Mrs Moody had a cottage) initially called 999 and asked for the police to attend. The 999 call-taker triaged the call as requiring the attendance of ambulance service and deemed this to be a matter that the police would not attend. This resulted in the family having to redial 999 and ask for an alternative service; during which some level of screening questions were repeated. This caused delay in the family reaching an appropriate service to attend.
I heard evidence from the mental health lead for Hampshire Constabulary who explained that as the incident on 19 April 2019 was occurring in the person’s home and, as such, the police have no power to intervene where a person is in their own home and in mental health crisis and/or threatening to harm themselves. The situation on 19 April was distinguished from that which had happened the day before, on 18 April, as the incident on 18 April had occurred in a public place and so, in that case, the police had a duty to attend.
I heard further evidence that there is a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) between Hampshire Police and the South Central Ambulance Service as to who is the primary response agency for persons making threats of suicidal ideation.
Ultimately, the family were confused as to where help would come from and the call-handler will not transfer the call to a particular route/service unless the caller makes the decision as to which service they need. Despite there being a MOU between the agencies this does not appear to be something that the general public is aware of, and the task of making the general public aware of this is likely to be insurmountable and therefore it remains entirely foreseeable that future delays could occur because callers are unaware of which emergency service is the correct one to request in a situation where a person is suffering a mental health crisis episode and/or expressing suicidal ideation within the boundaries of their home.
I heard further evidence regarding the existence of a different triage system, that operates in at least one area/jurisdiction of the country, but this only applies when a caller dials the 111 service; callers are given an option of accessing “mental health” services and this allows calls to be triaged through to an appropriately trained team/call-handler who can ask a set of wider diagnostic questions to understand and establish which agency, on the particular facts, should be the primary response service to that individual.
In the situation of Mr Moody it transpired that it was actually a mixed response that was required; both the police and ambulance services.
I am concerned that the current system of dealing with 999 calls in Hampshire gives rise to the potential for opportunities to be missed to triage the emergency call quickly and effectively, and to share information between agencies without the need to repeat the screening process, and these factors may result in further deaths in the future.",False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 June 2019.

The cause of death was found to be:
  1a     Hanging

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.","The deceased was born on 17 February 1999 and lived in Malvern, Worcestershire with his parents, together with his two brothers. He did not suffer any significant physical health condition or illnesses. He was a high achiever academically.

When he was about 16 years old his mother learned from his then girlfriend that he was expressing very disturbing thoughts. His outlook on life and his future seemed very troubled. On becoming aware of this, his school suggested that he might consult the ‘Relate Counselling Service’, but he did not find this helpful and so with the assistance of his parents, he consulted his GP, who was anxious to make an urgent referral to the local CAMHS.

He disclosed he was experiencing suicidal ideation, which he repeated when seeing his GP practice in March 2016. The initial referral by his GP was made on 19 January 2016 and he did have a history of inflicting deliberate self-harm. The result of this CAMHS referral was that he could be supported by the ‘Healthy Minds Service’. A second GP referral was made due to the disclosed specific suicidal intent.

He was assessed on 12 April 2016 and confirmed his suicidal thoughts, but it did not appear that the wider perspective of a young man who had just turned 17 readily admitting to suicidal ideation, despite his superficial presentation, was recognised as unusual and disturbing. It was suggested that he should consider CBT for his anxiety via the Healthy Minds Service, but it was felt that he did not meet the criteria for CAMHS intervention.

He did not apparently have an assessment by a consultant psychiatrist, but what was described as a ‘locum CAMHS senior practitioner’. A letter was written to the deceased on 26 April 2016 indicating that he did not meet the ‘criteria for CAMHS at present’. This acknowledged difficulties in communicating with the deceased and his mother. However, on one interpretation he could have met the criteria set out in a policy document. There did not appear to be any clear advice as to what to do should his suicidal feelings persist and that any help he might receive from the Healthy Minds Service was not successful.

There did not appear to be any recognition that he could present a superficially positive state of mind, whereas in reality if subject to more detailed assessment by a psychiatrist that might not have been the true picture.

There was never any follow-up to check on his progress.

In 2017 Alastair came to Manchester to study for a degree in Music. Whilst in Manchester, he disclosed to a friend that he was struggling with depression and he was found by his friend on a visit to be actively self-harming. He was encouraged to seek help as he was clearly having difficulties of a serious nature in coping with day to day life. He did not disclose to his parents his deteriorating state of mental health and he had no point of contact back to CAMHS or other psychiatric services.

On 14 May 2018 he was found dead, hanging by a ligature secured to a door frame.","1. Whether or not the specific deliberate self-harm or suicidal ideation criteria need to be reviewed and redrafted

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,Secretary of State for Health; Secretary of State for Education; the Health and Safety Executive (HSE); the Chief Executive Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust (GMMH); the Chief Executive of Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (CWP),On 13 July 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hannah Dolly Kaur Bharaj. The investigation concluded on 2 July 2019 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) Traumatic brain injury,"In her first year at university, Hannah Bharaj had anxiety and depression. There was an early opportunity to address her mental health when she did seek help on one occasion in her first year. She found the focus on her academic performance rather than her difficulties adjusting to her grief unhelpful and did not seek further help that academic year.

From May 2017, she began to use withholding food from herself to help her manage and provide a feeling of control. By September 2017 she had significantly deteriorated and sought further help from the University and GP. The GP identified it was likely she had an eating disorder. Hannah took a leave of absence from University and returned home. She was seen by the Bolton Eating Disorder Team, she was diagnosed as having atypical anorexia and depression. Attempts to treat her in the community were unsuccessful and her BMI was 13.6 kg/m2 by 4 December 2017. On 5 December 2017, she was admitted to the Eating Disorder Unit (EDU). She was a patient there until her discharge on 22 May 2018 when her BMI was 17.3 kg/m2. Formal psychology sessions had not started until 23 March 2018 because the Eating Disorder Unit did not have a psychologist in post.
Throughout her time in EDU Hannah expressed suicidal ideation which fluctuated. On 22 May 2018, she was discharged into the community. No discharge plan was sent to the GP. On 25 May 2018 a close family member died. At the final psychology appointment on 29 May 2018, she described specific methods she had considered to end her life including overdose. The barrier to that being insufficient medication. Her mental health had clearly deteriorated and her suicidal ideation increased. There was a failure to communicate the detail of this to her family or the prescribing GP. This probably contributed to Hannah taking, on 31 May 2018, a large overdose of her medication prescribed by her GP who had not been notified of her suicide risk by the Eating Disorder Unit or been asked by the EDU to prescribe in a way that would reduce risk.
Hannah was assessed by the RAID team, following the refusal of the Eating Disorder Unit Team to accept her back. A decision was made to place Hannah in an adult acute psychiatric bed.
A local NHS bed was not available and she was placed at The Priory in Cheadle on 7 June 2018. The Mental Health Trust did not appoint a Care Co-Ordinator until prompted by the Priory on 13 June 2018. The Care Co-Ordinator did not engage effectively with Hannah, her family or The Priory.
Hannah did not improve at The Priory. Her psychiatrist there identified that it was not the most appropriate place for her and wanted her to go to the EDU. The EDU took a different view. Hannah’s weight did not improve. Her anorexic thoughts did not improve. The consequence of this was that her suicidal ideation increased as her feelings of hopelessness increased. The placement of her in a setting not equipped to effectively deal with her severe anorexia has probably contributed to her death. The Priory did not request her notes from the EDU, particularly her counselling notes and as a result, they were not fully sighted of the specifics of her previously expressed thoughts of suicide. As a result, the level of risk in her leaving the unit whilst her mental health was deteriorating was not fully assessed. This has probably contributed to her death.
On 12 July 2018, Hannah went to the first floor cafe at John Lewis, Cheadle with her parents. The height of the balustrade was such that once she was on a table she was able to jump from the café to the ground floor suffering catastrophic injuries. She died at Salford Royal Hospital on 13 July 2018 from her injuries.","1. The inquest heard that discharge planning including communication with GPs and families around risk was not effective. Key information was not shared with the GP or the family particularly when care moved back to the family;

2. There was no clear evidence of consideration of discharge medication and risk around prescribing of medication post discharge from the EDU. As a result Hannah was prescribed a month’s supply of medication;

3. The suitability of acute mental health beds for young adults and lack of alternative provision. The inquest heard that Hannah went to an acute adult psychiatric bed because the EDU felt that it was the wrong environment for her and there was no other alternative. The inquest heard that there were concerns regarding the placement of a young adult in such a setting and how frightening it was to her;

4. Communication with private providers by NHS trusts once mental health trusts have placed individuals in private settings. During the time that Hannah was placed at the Priory the mental health trust who placed her did not have any discussion with Hannah, her family or the Priory regarding the placement. A care coordinator had been allocated by the Trust once requested by the Priory but no care coordination had taken place;

5. The expectations around information sharing with private providers and the expectation on private providers contracted by the NHS to seek information. The Priory did not request any notes from the EDU about Hannah. As a result they were unaware of detailed information held by the Trust regarding previously expressed suicidal ideation;

6. Understanding and communication by the Priory about the change in level of risk when Hannah moved from a secure environment to periods of time outside the unit in the care of her family;

7. The inquest was told by the clinical lead for Eating Disorders of the high risk of Eating Disorders in high achieving students on courses such as medicine. In such cases, the inquest was told universities need to be alert to early signs of anxiety that risk leading to eating disorders developing. As part of this understanding by universities the inquest was told of the need to recognise early signs of mental health issues and listen carefully from an early stage. The skill set/training of academics in welfare roles in relation to mental health was described as key and specific work with Eating Disorder services and training of those involved in welfare programmes supporting students can be effective;

8. The guidance in relation to the height of glass balustrades where items such as tables, in cafes open to the public including children and other vulnerable people, are placed in close proximity to the glass. The glass balustrade in John Lewis was at a height that accorded with the required standard but by simply climbing onto the table that was adjacent to the balustrade Hannah was able to easily go over the balustrade.",True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False

Brown,Birmingham and Solihull,Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust (‘BSMHT’); Black Country Partnership Foundation Trust (‘BCPFT’); West Midlands Police; NHS Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group; NHS England,"On 15/10/2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of David Jonathan Jukes. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 11 July 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was Mr. Jukes’ death was a result of suicide. Despite being open to a Home Treatment Team (‘HTT’) and the Complex Treatment Service (‘CTS’) within Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (‘BSMHT’) Mr. Jukes had not undergone an adequate assessment of his mental health by the time of his death as a result of the following: i. At the time of attendance by the Liaison and Diversion practitioner at Oldbury custody suite on 28 September 2018, the practitioner did not have full details of the events during the evening of the 27th into 28th from West Midlands Police nor access to records pertaining to his mental health held by his GP, the West Midlands Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service and BSMHT. With access to this information, she would have requested a Mental Health Act Assessment. ii. A psychiatrist did not attend to assess Mr. Jukes whilst he was in custody on 28 September 2018 contrary to normal HTT practice. iii. Clinicians within HTT did not make adequate attempts to locate and engage with Mr. Jukes after being made aware of the events of the 27th and 28th September 2018 and after it was reported that he was threatening harm to others and to himself in a conversation with a psychologist on 2 October 2018. iv. Clinicians within HTT did not make adequate attempts to locate and engage with Mr. Jukes after he failed to attend for medical review on 4 October 2018; v. Clinicians within HTT did not offer Mr. Jukes an urgent medical review when they spoke to him on the morning of 9 October 2018. It is possible that a full assessment would have prevented Mr. Jukes’ death on 9 October 2018 but it cannot be said that it would have been likely to prevent his death as it is not known what the outcome of such an assessment would have been nor to what extent any treatment following assessment would have been effective given the complex nature of his chronic condition, his alcohol and drug use and his hostility to mental health care providers.","On 9 October 2018 at 15:09 Mr. Jukes was declared deceased by paramedics in the back garden of 179 Ridgacre Road, Quinton. Due to childhood trauma and experiences in the armed forces, Mr. Jukes had been battling with mental illness for a long time; he abused illegal drugs and alcohol as a way of managing his condition. In around 2006 he was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and was detained under the Mental Health Act for a brief period. He attempted to hang himself in 2016. In July 2018 he self-referred to the NHS West Midlands’ Transition, Intervention and Liaison Services (‘TILS’). Following an assessment by TILS on 31 August 2018 he was referred to the Complex Treatment Service (‘CTS’), a new team within Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (‘BSMHT’) providing NHS care specifically for veterans. Unfortunately the service was not to be fully operational in the West Midlands until the end of September 2018 and therefore there was a delay in contacting him. During this period Mr. Jukes’ condition markedly deteriorated with he and his wife identifying that he was losing control during the weekend of 15 September 2018 culminating in him taking an excess dose of his sleeping medication on Monday 17 September 2018. Consequently he was referred to the Home Treatment Team (‘HTT’) within BSMHT. He was reviewed by CPNs at home on 19 and 21 September at which time he did engage with services although showing resistance and was booked for a medical assessment. Despite attendances on 24 and 27 September 2018 for medical assessment with a psychiatrist the assessment could not be completed because he was too difficult to assess, principally as a result of his profound mistrust of, and hostility towards, mental health services thought to derive from the failure of previous treatment. It was felt that his immediate risk of suicide and self harm was low. However, during the evening of 27 September 2018 he became extremely agitated and aggressive with his family ultimately barricading himself in his loft and threatening suicide and harm to anyone who tried to come in. Police negotiators attempted to coax Mr. Jukes out of the loft but after several hours it was deemed best to leave him. He was arrested on suspicion of assault during this incident after coming down from the loft on 28 September 2018. Whilst at Oldbury custody suite awaiting interview a health care practitioner and a community psychiatric nurse from the police liaison and diversion service were asked to review him; he did not engage with assessment but displayed no immediate risk to self. He initially returned to the family home following his release without charge from custody on 28 but then left during the afternoon of 29 September 2018. On 2 October he was contacted by the CTS psychologist. During this 20 minute phone-call the psychologist became extremely concerned about Mr. Jukes who was making threats against HTT and was indicating he had the means and a plan to end his own life. However, he would not disclose where he was. The psychologist informed HTT with the hope that they would attempt to contact Mr. Jukes. HTT did not attempt to contact Mr. Jukes or his wife but decided to await a pre-planned medical review on 4 October 2019. He did not attend that review and there is a record of a single unanswered call by HTT to contact him but it appears this was actually to his wife’s phone by mistake. The CTS psychologist called his mobile phone twice on 4 October 2018 but the calls went to voicemail. She reported her concerns for him to West Midlands Police on 5 October 2018 but as his location was unknown there was nothing the police could do at that time. Mr. Jukes was seen to return to the vicinity of [REDACTED] on 7 October 2018 and the police were informed of his presence but no unit was available to attend during the next 48 hours. An attempt to contact HTT was also made by Mr. Jukes’ wife on 8 October 2018 with the intention of making them aware of his location but the team did not return the call. On the morning of 9 October 2018 a HTT nurse spoke to Mr. Jukes on the phone to invite him to a medical review, it was suspected that he was intoxicated, he disclosed no immediate concerns and stated he would attend an appointment on 12 October 2018. He told the nurse he was back at [REDACTED]. There was no attempt to arrange a review of Mr. Jukes sooner. At 10:23 on 9 October, police officers attended [REDACTED] in response to a call from his wife that Mr. Jukes was at the address and needed to leave because a non-molestation order was being obtained. He was found sat in the rear garden; he told the officers he would charge his phone in the shed and go - he gave the officers no cause for concern and no grounds to remove him from the property. However, when court bailiffs attended to serve the non-molestation order later that day Mr. Jukes was found hanging from a ligature fixed to the garden gate. Post mortem testing has shown that Mr. Jukes was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of his death. Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be: 1 a) HANGING","1. The psychiatric liaison and diversion practitioner employed by BCPFT who attended to review Mr. Jukes in Oldbury custody suite on 28 September 2018 did not have sufficient information about the history of arrest to inform her decision making on assessment in custody. She was provided with a print out of the first two pages of the custody record which included the statutory arrest reason and the circumstances of arrest but nothing that indicated that he had barricaded himself in the loft, threatened suicide and harm to others and not come out in response to police negotiators. This information was not included in a verbal handover according to the nurse’s evidence and there is no record of it being handed over to her. She stated in evidence that if she had been aware of the extent of the events overnight on the 27th into the 28th she would have arranged a Mental Health Act assessment when he did not engage with her. There is a risk to life if assessments of mental health in custody are not informed by material information about circumstances connected with arrest.

2. The above psychiatric liaison and diversion practitioner gave evidence that she contacted either the duty bed manager for BSMHT or the BSMHT liaison and diversion team based at Perry Barr custody suite and was informed that Mr. Jukes was not known to the service. She stated that if she had been aware that he was open to the HTT she would have sought information about his involvement and would have made the team aware that he was in custody and the events of the previous evening. It was not established during the inquest and has not been established in BSMHT RCA investigation how this breakdown in communication occurred. Evidence was heard that the introduction of the Merit Vanguard system would not give a BCPFT employee in a custody suite access to some information and would mitigate against such circumstances arising again but it does not explain why the nurse was left with the impression that he was not known to services. It is not unusual that clinicians from different mental health trusts will need to discuss patients and as full records are not available through the Merit Vanguard this will continue to arise. If reliable information is not being passed there is a risk to life from ill-informed decision making.

3. Despite not being informed by the BCPFT liaison and diversion nurse that Mr. Jukes was in custody the HTT were made aware by his wife that he was in custody on 28 September 2018. She also gave some information about the circumstances of his arrest, further information about the incident and police involvement had been reported to Street Triage during the night and was noted in the RIO notes. Despite this, no psychiatrist visited or attempted to visit Mr. Jukes in custody which it was stated in evidence was the usual practice of the team. It is not known why this was. Not having a robust and effective system to carry out necessary assessments whilst a patient is detained in police custody puts lives at risk.

4. Following his release from custody on 28 September 2018 and evidence from a psychologist that he was treating suicide and harm to others, on 2 October 2018 the HTT’s only recorded attempt to contact Mr. Jukes before 9 October 2018 was a single call (which probably mistakenly went to his wife’s phone) on 4 October 2018. Despite the fact that his location was unknown and he had not attended a planned medical review on 4 October 2018 there was no email communication to Mr. Jukes (although he had communicated this way with the team before and provided them with his email address) nor a call to his wife to ask her for assistance. There was evidence at inquest from the RCA Author that there should have been more effort to contact him at least from the 4th onwards if not before. Failure to utilise all means of locating a patient whose whereabouts are unknown, who requires assessment and who is not making contact with the team puts lives at risk.

5. It was planned that Mr. Jukes would be discussed at a team meeting on 3 October 2018 after the psychologist raised concerns on the 2nd. There is no credible evidence he was discussed or a plan made to locate and assess him. No explanation was provided in evidence nor was evidence given of a strategy to guard against this occurring in future. Therefore there continues to be a risk that plans to discuss patients in meetings will not be followed through which puts lives at risk.

6. On 9 October 2018 a HTT clinician talked to Mr. Jukes on the phone at which time he sounded intoxicated, was calm and polite, gave his location and agreed to attend an appointment for a medical review on 12 October 2018 if a bus pass were provided to his location for him to attend. No arrangements were made in an attempt to assess Mr. Jukes before 12 October 2018. By this time there was reason to suspect Mr. Jukes was at risk of harm to self or others, was under the influence of substances, had not had a full assessment by the team, had recently not been engaging with services and his location had been unknown for over a week. This evidence indicates that those making the decision to ask Mr. Jukes to attend on the 12th underestimated his risk and were not proactive in making contact. The staff involved maintained in evidence that they acted appropriately, evidence was given that this was not the finding of the Root Cause Analysis investigation review panel. In these circumstances to fail to attempt to assess as soon as reasonably practicable a patient who has come back into contact with the team as soon as reasonably practicable puts lives at risk. No evidence was given of specific action to address the decisions that were made on 9 October 2018 with the individuals involved or the team generally and therefore the risk continues.

7. Throughout the inquest evidence was given of alleged attempted contact and decision making with respect to Mr. Jukes that was not recorded in his BSMHT RIO notes. Furthermore, his Risk Screen was not updated after information came to HTT’s attention that affected his risk assessment. There was some evidence that HTT do not have capacity to fulfil their obligation to keep records but evidence from some witnesses suggested that they did not view record keeping as a necessity. If, for whatever reason, RIO notes are not an accurate reflection of contacts, actions and decision-making clinicians may be misled or ill-informed creating a risk to life. Evidence was given that there is an e-learning module on the topic of record keeping and a ‘Key message’ 3 minute video but it is not compulsory for staff to watch the video or feedback on it and staff are not tested or individually audited. Consequently there continues to be a risk that individuals will not comply with their duty to keep proper records and that this noncompliance will go undetected.

8. Evidence was given at the inquest that the reason HTT may not be maintaining good record keeping was due to insufficient capacity arising from a combination of too few staff arising from under-funding of the service and unnecessary referrals being made to the team. Evidence was given that there is work underway to introduce a system to prevent inappropriate referrals and that funding has been granted for a further two CPNs for HTTs within BSMHT. However the evidence was that this will not be enough to enable staff to have the time to comply with their obligations to update progress notes and risk assessments. If funding is not sufficient to enable staff to fulfil their professional obligations to their patients, lives are at risk.",False,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Hon. Matt Hancock MP, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care","On 07/04/2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sasha Sabrina Forster aged 20. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 May 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was that Sasha died as the result of suicide, following her deliberate ingestion of a fatal overdose of propranolol tablets.","(1) Sasha was a young woman who had struggled for many years with a number of mental health disorders, and had been under the care of mental health services since early adolescence. Her diagnoses were: (i) severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; (ii) complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; (iii) Autistic Spectrum Disorder (although the results of the assessment which confirmed this diagnosis were not available until after Sasha’s death); (iv) traits of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (although this was strongly disputed by Sasha and her family).

(2) Sasha had a lengthy history of self-harm, both through cutting herself and through taking deliberate overdoses of paracetamol. More recently, she had taken a number of overdoses of propranolol (a drug which she had managed to source despite it not being prescribed to her, and which in overdose carried a significant risk of death); one such overdose in January 2017 had resulted in her suffering a near-fatal cardiac arrest.

(3) Sasha’s OCD meant that she remained at risk even when detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983. This is because she felt compelled to refuse food or drink provided to her, and any resulting application of restraint to ensure forced feeding/hydration would prove extremely distressing and potentially damaging. As a result, Sasha having been detained under s.3 MHA 1983 following the near-fatal overdose in January 2017, those treating her sought to balance the risks she presented by granting her regular periods of s.17 leave, initially to allow her to leave the hospital ward for a fixed period of time so that she could buy her own food and drink, and latterly to allow her to stay overnight at home in an environment which she found less distressing, this being conditional on her returning to the ward at agreed times.

(4) On occasions, however, Sasha’s behaviour whilst away from the ward on s.17 leave prompted her responsible clinician to revoke that s.17 leave, and require her to return to the ward. In those circumstances, legal responsibility for ensuring Sasha’s prompt return to the ward lay with Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SBP). Whilst SBP could ask the police to assist in doing this, the police were not legally obliged to do so, and often would decline such requests.

(5) On such occasions, SBP did not generally arrange for authorised persons to collect Sasha and return her to the ward, but would instead seek to rely on her mother returning her and, in order to secure Sasha’s agreement to this course, would agree not to insist on her immediate return. Sometimes, this would involve allowing Sasha to go home overnight and be brought to the ward the next day.

(6) On occasions during such “negotiated extension” periods, Sasha would continue to self-harm (both through cutting and taking overdoses) or go missing from home, and therefore could not be returned to the ward as agreed.","(1) Evidence was given during the inquest by SBP staff on the ward concerned, that the reason SBP staff did not arrange to collect Sasha and return her to the ward when her s.17 leave had been revoked, was that they did not have the resources to allow them to do this, this despite it being their legal responsibility to do so.

(2) Sasha’s mother gave evidence that SBP’s reliance on her bringing Sasha back to the ward when s.17 leave had been revoked, placed an unfair and intolerable burden on her, in circumstances when she and the rest of the family were struggling to keep Sasha safe. Knowing that SBP would not send someone out to collect Sasha made her feel that she had no choice but to agree to their request.

(3) The last such occasion when SBP staff on the ward decided that Sasha’s s.17 leave should be revoked was on the afternoon of her death on 31.3.17. Although formal revocation of leave was never finalised, Sasha’s mother was given to believe that it would be, and again reluctantly agreed to bring Sasha back to the ward. Whilst with her mother, Sasha was able to run off and take the substantial propranolol overdose which proved to be fatal.",True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False

His parents were confused as to where help would come from and practitioners from the two agencies were unclear as to where the responsibility lay. Although an improved explanatory leaflet for families about the responsibilities of the agencies is now in the course of being finalised and liaison to clarify respective roles has now taken place between senior managers of the agencies, it appears to me that a better understanding of those roles would be achieved if the practitioners actually involved in patient care themselves liaised more about what action and support should be made available to patients and relatives in crisis situations such as that faced by George and his family in the last days of his life.",False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False

Wilcox,London Inner West,"Ms Claire Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust; Simon Stevens, Chief Executive, NHS England","On 5 January 2019, evidence was heard touching the death of Peter George Garvin. Mr Garvin had entered the Regent’s Canal in Westminster on 31 January 2018, with the intention of taking his own life. He was 86 years old at the time of his death. The findings of the court were as follows:

How, when and where the deceased came by her death:

Mr Garvin was suffering with a second episode of treatment resistant depression. He had previously attempted to take his own life in October 2017. At or around 10:35 on 31 January 2018 he entered the Regent’s Canal in Westminster with the intention of taking his own life. There was no third party involvement. He was recovered and recognised as life extinct at 12:27.","At the time of his death Mr Garvin was under the care of the Community Mental Health Team, however his medication was being prescribed by his GP. There were intermittent communication problems between the CMHT and the GP regarding his prescribing.

In October 2017 he had required admission but due to the lack of local beds he had been hospitalised in Milton Keynes.

Mr Garvin’s illness placed a lot of strain on his elderly wife, but she was not offered a carer’s assessment prior to his death.

His illness was treatment resistant, and he asked for private psychiatric assessment in a search of a cure. He saw a private psychiatrist on 19 January 2018.

When the CMHT became aware that he had sought private treatment he was informed that he would be discharged from the CMHT. He was informed of this by his CPN at a home visit of 29 January 2018. This had a significant adverse effect on his mood. Just two days later, he took his own life.

It is the policy of Mr Garvin’s consultant to discharge patients from NHS care if they are taken for private treatment, apparently due to concern over potential communication difficulties.

The private psychiatrist stated in evidence that she could only have seen Mr Garvin intermittently in outpatients which in her view he was too ill for, or admit him to hospital. This would have deprived Mr Garvin of the option of being cared for at home in the community.","1. That there should be a system of doctor to doctor communication to facilitate prescribing, for example through direct email contact.

2. That there should be sufficient local beds so that such a vulnerable person should not have to be hospitalised so very far from home.

3. That if patients seek private psychiatric care they should not be discharged by the NHS. Instead a memorandum of understanding should be agreed between the NHS and private psychiatric consultants to allow joint working and facilitate patient care. This should surely be possible along the lines of such agreements with GPs.

He had placed a rope around his neck and was found suspended from the rugby posts, he had intended to take his own life.","Chris’s death was due to suicide. However, in the 5 days leading up to his death he was under the care of the mental health team. On 26 and 27 November Chris had been assessed as high risk and the plan was to assess him in the community as he indicated he was willing to engage. On 27 and 28 November he failed to respond to calls and disengaged from the service. On 29 November he cut his wrist and was assessed as high risk again by the mental health liaison team at the hospital and the plan remained the same, there was an underestimation of his condition at this assessment. Chris failed to be at home for the assessment immediately following his discharge. A welfare call to the police was made but the important information from the police following the welfare check was not relayed to the team or recorded in the records as it should have been. The cold call to Chris’s property on 30 November resulted in the only action of leaving a letter with another appointment; there was no escalation as suggested in the “no response and police welfare check requests procedure” which is only a guide for patients in primary care as no policy exists. Finally, there was no contact made with the family during 29 or 30 due to a poorly completed information sharing form.","1. The information sharing form – in this case it was not explicit as to whom information could be shared with hence the family were not informed or contacted; is there an issue with the form itself to make this clearer for clinicians to be more explicit or is there a training issue for the staff involved with completing this form?
2. On the RIO records system I was advised that it put the first information sharing form as the most recent when it wasn’t, in this case there was a more recent form, this misled the staff, although both forms were clearly completed and on the RIO system – is this a technical matter with IT or is this a training matter for the staff using the system?

4. The demographics page in RIO – in this case it was incomplete and I was told it often is – is this training issue for the staff or again a technical matter with the RIO system?
5. I was told that there is no “no response policy” for those in primary care; that the policy which exists is for secondary or tertiary care and is therefore not applicable to the service users or staff in primary care. This would also raise the question of training
6.

This would also raise the question of training.
7. RIO entries generally – I was told that there is an expectation that staff are expected to make their entry onto the RIO system within either 72 hrs. or 24 hrs. Is this in line with what professional bodies expect and should it be?
8. The intensive service switchboard – is there an issue in relation to the training of staff and their ability to react to protecting life? I was told they do not have ability to call 999 but that they advise the service user to make the call, is that appropriate?

Kearsley,Greater Manchester North,"Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, Greater Manchester Police (GMP); Chief Executive, Pennine Care NHS Trust (PCT); Chief Executive, NWAS (NWAS); Jon Rouse, Chief Officer for the Health and Social Care Partnership and Chair of the Health and Justice Board","On 20 December 2018 I concluded the inquest into the death of Mr Gregory Rewkowski (GR) who died on 29 October 2017 at his home address. A jury reached the following conclusion in respect of Mr Rewkowski's death:

""On the balance of probabilities the deceased died as a result of hanging at his home address. It is more likely than not he intended to end his life. Having listened to the evidence the jury determined that Pennine Care NHS Trust should have informed the next of kin of the deceased's discharge from hospital and information about his social media posts. The jury determined the breakdown in communications with Pennine Care NHS Trust, Greater Manchester Police and North West Ambulance Service resulted in the deceased not being contacted until 28 October 2017. The lack of knowledge of procedures and policies of all services led to a delay in acting in a timely and appropriate manner. It is the jury's findings these failings did not make any contribution to the death"".","The circumstances leading up to GR's death are as follows:

On 17 September 2017 he was taken from his home address on a Section 136 by Greater Manchester Police to hospital where he was detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, having been found, by the police, by his friends, trying to tie a ligature. Of note, he was taken to hospital from his home on a Section 136.

GR remained in hospital until 26 October 2017 when he was discharged to his home address.

It was acknowledged by PCT, that whilst he was a patient and had provided his consent for his ex-partner to be involved in aspects of his care, there was no attempt made to invite her to ward rounds or to discuss discharge planning. The plan was for him to be discharged on 30 October, however GR requested his own discharge on 26 October. At this time he was an informal patient and there were no grounds to detain him.

On the morning of 27 October 2017 another patient alerted the clinical unit lead (AM) to the fact GR had posted on social media his ""last goodbyes"". The evidence of the clinical lead AM was she had asked a nurse, TC, to raise a concern for welfare. TC had no recollection of this. No action was taken until another nurse LD came on duty. At 15:57 a concern for welfare call was placed to GMP.

The concern for welfare related to the risk to the life of GR.

The Court heard evidence from 4 registered mental health nurses from PCT and other witnesses including a Consultant Psychiatrist. All provided evidence to the Court of their understanding of the escalation of concerns for welfare in such circumstances. It was evident all understood the process to be in the event of a concern for welfare in these circumstances, it was the police who were contacted to respond.

The call handler in GMP graded the call as requiring allocation within 20 minutes and attendance within one hour.

The Court also heard how every PCT and GMP witness were of the opinion GR required a face to face assessment.

Having switched the call to a Radio Operator and Radio Assist, the Court heard how both these witnesses were of the opinion, from the information provided, that this was a ""medical matter"". The Court noted these opinions were not based on the availability of resources but on the understanding different agencies (Mental Health services and social services) were using the police, particularly on a Friday afternoon as this was, to complete tasks which they had not finished. The witnesses understood this view had been acknowledged by the Senior Leadership Team in GMP who had through ""emails and snippets of information"", promoted the view that such matters should be ""pushed back"" to the reporting agency.

The duty Sgt was contacted and acknowledged he was advised this was a medical matter. He agreed he did not dispute this opinion. At the time there was another incident requiring allocation and he advised the Court this would have taken all available resources.

At 16:15 GMP contacted nurse LD and advised her she needed to report the matter to NWAS as it was a medical matter. This was unexpected advice for nurse LD who questioned whether it was for her to do this. She was advised it was.

The GMP Radio Operator did not contact NWAS to transfer the incident service to service. However GMP did contact NWAS to ascertain if the matter had been logged with them. It had not, but no further information was provided to NWAS.

LD who was one of two qualified nurses caring for 18 inpatients on an acute psychiatric ward did not contact NWAS by the end of her shift.

The following day on 28 October 2017, AM noted the matter had not been dealt with and asked another nurse, NK, to escalate a cause for concern. NK had been on leave the previous week so spent time reading GR's medical notes to understand what had happened. She tried to contact GR and then called his ex-partner.

NK then tried to contact NWAS via 111. The Court heard these calls. Advice was provided to NK that the cause for concern could not be reported via 111 due to a ""breach of confidentiality"".

At 13:15 NK contacted NWAS via 999. The call was triaged as Grade 3 requiring allocation and response within 120 minutes. At 15:14 the Court heard evidence the call had not been allocated and a decision was taken to transfer the call to the Urgent Care Centre of NWAS for a telephone triage.

A telephone call was made to GR at this time by a Registered General Nurse, PR. The Court heard this telephone call. It was accepted by PR that there was a misunderstanding on her part when GR mentioned spending days and nights in the dark. In addition she acknowledged she talked over him when he was starting to say how he was feeling. He did not therefore answer this question. Her evidence was that whilst she did not believe he needed an ambulance she offered transport to hospital, which in her view, he declined.

When this contact was relayed by PR to nurse TC at PCT it was not understood this had been a telephone conversation by NWAS as opposed to face to face assessment.

GR was found hanging at his property the following day.","Pennine Care Trust

• The Court heard from the nurses who were tasked to raise a concern for welfare of the practical time difficulties in doing this, given they were working on an acute in-patient psychiatric ward. It was unclear why the clinical lead did not deal with this matter as she was the person to whom the information had initially been provided.

• No-one considered, at any stage the escalation of this incident to the on-call Senior manager when they were having difficulties contacting the emergency services or when GMP had provided the advice to contact NWAS.

• None of the ward staff were aware of the restrictions on the ward telephones which prohibit 111 calls from being, this meant time was spent trying to make such calls.

North West Ambulance Service

• In cases involving the engagement of Article 2 ECHR there is duty on agencies to investigate the circumstances of the death in order to learn lessons. There was little investigation conducted by NWAS in respect of this case. It was only through the evidence of NK the Court learnt of the existence of the 111 telephone calls she had attempted to make and the information provided to her. In addition until the evidence of PR the Court had not been advised of the removal of the call from the allocation list and the decision made this could be triaged by urgent care.

• The Court heard the calls between NK and NWAS. Advice was provided to NK that a concern for welfare could not be taken by them due to a potential ""breach of confidentiality"". This led to a further delay in this concern for welfare call being passed to NWAS.

• The decision to remove the concern for welfare call from the allocation list to be triaged by urgent care meant no face to face assessment was conducted. Moreover the telephone triage call was conducted by a RGN who had limited mental health training.

• The Court heard how the call was graded as a Grade 3 however when taken through the evidence in Court several questions on the triage system had been incorrectly completed.

All three agencies and GMCA

Greater Manchester Police

• There is a lack of acknowledgment of the role of the police when dealing with people who are taken on a Section 136 from their own home. The Court did not explore the numbers of Section 136 patients who are taken to a place of safety from their home address. The Court heard how Mr Rewkowski had been taken from his own home on 17 September. Other agencies are clearly familiar with this process and how GMP facilitate this. However this was also used as an explanation as to why GMP may have been restricted in what they could do on 27 and 28 October i.e. ""...there is nothing we can do if we attend at his home own. We have no powers."" There appears to be a significant difference between the legal position and the practical reality of how police deal with such matters if they are called to a home address. This inconsistency is causing confusion amongst other agencies.

• In this case GMP did not call NWAS and asked the nurses to contact NWAS. The Court heard evidence from the Deputy Sector manager for NWAS as to how GMP will contact them to attend concerns for welfare. This was not a process PCT staff were familiar with. This also led to a delay in the call being made.

• Evidence was heard from the Inpatient Services Manager of PCT of their understanding, that the police are the organisation to call in relation to concerns for welfare (regarding risk to life). The Court heard PCT are still advised the police are the contact. In addition this is the advice within the acute trusts.

• It was clear to the Court from all Senior Managers that there was a distinct lack of understanding across all three agencies of each agencies roles/responsibilities, systems of working and current practices in relation to concerns for welfare involving risk to life (not immediate i.e. someone in the process of harming themselves). The evidence to the Court was of a confused picture across Greater Manchester with no clear guidance as to how to deal with such matters. Moreover it was apparent there is no documented GM wide process to allow staff on the ground clear information as to how to deal with such matters.

• The Court heard evidence there is no Mental Health Community Response team available to deal with mental health issues out of hours. The only out of hours service is in A&E which would necessitate someone attending there. Evidence was given as to the substantial increase in such issues being reported to GMP. The Court heard how there is now a mental health professional within the GMP control room to assist with the calls received. However the main issues are in attending to conduct face to face assessments. The police are the service who have a power to enter property, unlike other services. Therefore whilst they may not be best placed in respect of the assessment they are often called. Given the issue in respect of resources heard throughout this Inquest the Court would question the lack of this Mental Health provision.",True,True,False,False,True,True,True,False

Knight,South Wales Central,"Chief Executive, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board; West Quay Surgery",On 4 September 2018 an inquest was opened into the death of Mrs Ruth Ellen Edwards.

The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,"Mrs Edwards died at her home address of [REDACTED] on 31 August 2018 after she had hanged herself from the attic ladder. She had a long history of mental health problems and had attempted suicide a number of times.

On 23 August 2018 she was admitted to the University Hospital of Wales following a drug overdose. She was discharged the same night and told to see her GP. She saw her GP for an assessment on 24 August and was visited regularly up until her death by the REACT team.","(1) Mrs Edwards’ discharge from hospital following overdose on 23 August to see GP was surprising. It was expected in these circumstances that Mrs Edwards would have been transferred to Llandough Hospital for a psychiatric liaison assessment. Instead, responsibility for any further assessment and treatment of Mrs Edwards was passed entirely to Mrs Edwards and her family.

The training they had received on the implementation of the Mental Health Act in relation to informal patients had not covered this aspect sufficiently.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 November 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was that;

Matthew Arkle died as the result of suicide.

Matthew was a voluntary patient at the Wedgewood Unit, West Suffolk Hospital who was granted one hour's unescorted leave on 4 April 2017 but did not return.

On the morning of 6 April 2017 Matthew was found hanging next to a tree in an area of heath land directly adjacent to the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1(a) Hanging
1(b)
1(c)
2 Schizophrenia and depression.","Matthew Arkle was a 37 year-old man with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.

He had been mentally unwell for some time and had a number of admissions to hospital under the Mental Health Act (his first in the year 2000).

In December 2016 Matthew took an overdose of prescription medication and was admitted as an inpatient until 1 February 2017.

On 17 February 2017 he was re-admitted to the Wedgewood Unit, West Suffolk Hospital as an informal patient following a further overdose of prescription medication.","Consideration and risk assessment process by the nurse who authorised the unescorted leave.

It was acknowledged that this information may not have changed the decision, but it was deemed to be an important factor to take into consideration.

It was further acknowledged that due to Matthew’s generally compliant nature, had he been asked not to take unescorted leave that day (due to his family's concerns) then he may well have remained on the ward of his own choice.

Witnesses on duty on the Northgate ward on 4 April confirmed that they were unaware of Matthew’s family request regarding leave that day. Further, there was no written note of the family's request on Matthew's case file and no witnesses had any memory of it being verbally raised at the ward handover meeting at the start of the shift.

It was reported that the activity on ward was extremely high on 4 April 2017. It was heard that although staffing met the required levels, there were a number of patients requiring additional supervision and a high number of ‘staff personal alarms’ were being activated during the shift. The charge nurse on duty said “I cannot stress enough how busy it was that day” and agreed the ward on 4 April could be described as being chaotic.

In part, this was held to be the reason that Matthew’s time of leaving Northgate ward to go on unescorted leave was originally recorded to be 19:00 with the police subsequently being alerted to his missing person status at 21:06.

CCTV evidence secured from a local garage in the weeks following his death showed that Matthew must have left the ward no later than 17:30 on the evening of 4 April. It was subsequently identified that the 19:00 timing had been an ‘approximation’ with it being agreed 17:30 would be a realistic time for Matthew having left the ward.

As such Matthew’s unescorted leave should have ended at 18:30 with the alarm being raised for Matthew’s absence occurring much earlier than it did. This would have allowed searches undertaken by hospital staff, Matthew’s family and the police to commence sooner.

It was confirmed during the hearing that in relation to patients going missing, there is no policy in place for a review of CCTV footage available at the Wedgewood Unit or the West Suffolk Hospital to confirm time of leaving, direction of travel, etc. This would have clearly provided an accurate time and possibly direction of travel in Matthew’s case.

It was heard that once the Suffolk Constabulary were informed of Matthew’s absence they instigated their missing persons protocol designating Matthew as a medium risk on the basis of the information received from staff at the Northgate ward. On the basis of the information the Suffolk Constabulary received this was found to be the appropriate level when reviewing their risk assessment process.

However, Suffolk Constabulary were not told that Matthew had seriously attempted suicide on two occasions in the past three months, were not told that his family had specifically requested he not be granted unescorted leave on 4 April or that on the previous day Matthew’s care coordinator had described him “as the lowest I have seen him for some time.” It was heard that there was no set format for the type or nature of the information to be given to the police when a patient goes missing and what information was available in Matthew’s case was incomplete (including no recent photograph).

In evidence it was heard that had the Suffolk Constabulary been given the above information at the time of his going missing that “in all likelihood” Matthew’s risk would have been assessed as being ‘high’.

It was then explained that once a ‘high’ risk had been declared additional police resources would have become available. This included the immediate deployment of up to 10 police officers to assist in the initial search for Matthew on the night of 4 April.

In relation to the timing of Matthew’s unescorted leave it was well documented in his notes that his auditory hallucinations became strongest in the evenings which was often associated with a lowering in his mood. The charge nurse who granted the unescorted leave said that when they did so they could not see any evidence of ‘internal stimulation’ from auditory hallucination explaining that Matthew did not appear vacant or distracted.

However, when coupled to the other identified factors in this case the timing of Matthew’s request for unescorted leave was not an identified feature of the risk assessment process prior to his unescorted leave being granted.

The jury recorded that the following circumstances may have contributed to Matthew’s death:

1. A failure of appropriate record keeping within Northgate ward.
2. A failure of verbal and written communication within Northgate ward.
3. The general high level of activity and stress on Northgate ward on 4 April 2017.
4. The delay in noticing, reacting and reporting Matthew as missing.
5. The timing of Matthew's release being late afternoon.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Brown,Birmingham and Solihull,NHS England; Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group,On 23/08/2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Peter Edge and an inquest is listed to take place on 11 December 2018.,"Evidence obtained to date indicates that the deceased was found hanging in the shed in the back garden of his home address in the Quinton area of Birmingham on 18 August 2018. He was found by his wife who took him down from the ligature and attempted to perform resuscitation and called an ambulance. An ambulance crew arrived and continued CPR before pronouncing life extinct after approximately 30 minutes at 15:48. The deceased had a diagnosis of depression and a history of self-harm. On 17 August 2018 the deceased had attempted to hang himself but was discovered by his wife and taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he was assessed by the RAID team of the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. When he was physically fit he was released but RAID referred him to the home treatment team. Home treatment team attended the home address on 18 August 2018 at 1300hrs and left a note due to no-one answering the door at deceased home address. The deceased's wife has returned home at 1330hrs, seen the note and searched for deceased leading to him being found deceased.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:
1) Hanging
2) Presence of ethanol","1. It is the evidence of [REDACTED] that the deceased had stated to the RAID team on 17 August 2018 that he wanted to be admitted and if he was discharged would kill himself. He was discharged with a referral requesting the Home Treatment Team (‘HTT’) call him the next day.

2. When [REDACTED] returned home at about 13:30 she found the note from the HTT saying that they had visited but left when no response was obtained. She called the HTT and begged them to come back that day as she felt her husband was in imminent danger. They stated they could not return that day because they needed to see other patients.

3. The coroner is aware, although not from evidence obtained in respect of Mr Edge’s case as the inquest is yet to take place, that inpatient beds within the BSMHFT are currently operating at 109% capacity and are often not available. Consequently, patients who would otherwise have been offered in-patient treatment are having to be managed by the HTTs, partly as a consequence of this but partly due to other pressures. The demand on the HTTs is often too great to enable them to visit all patients requiring a visit in any one day, which in turn is putting pressure on out of hours services. It is understood that the trust is exploring options to expand its HTT service but funding is required.

4. The fact that at the current time HTTs cannot attend patients when required creates a risk to life.

5. Although evidence at inquest has yet to be heard there is a concern that this case, along with several other cases being investigated by the Birmingham and Solihull Coroners’ jurisdiction, may arise from underfunding of mental health services.

6. The strain on the systems of mental health services provided by both Forward Thinking Birmingham and Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust has become apparent to the Birmingham and Solihull Coroners in recent months. Consequently, this report to prevent future deaths is being made in conjunction with reports to prevent future deaths arising from six other investigations into deaths between May and August 2018 that demonstrate a risk that future deaths will occur as a result of underfunding.

Bennett,Birmingham and Solihull,NHS England; Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group; Future Care & Social Care Association,On 15 May 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Simon Anthony Graham. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 28 September 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.,"The deceased was diagnosed with depression in 2015 which was later linked to excessive alcohol consumption. On 28 April 2018 he attempted to take his own life via an overdose and was admitted to hospital. Once physically recovered, mental health Drs and nurses concluded there was no imminent risk of suicide, and deemed it appropriate to discharge him to a respite home at 155 College Road with support from the home treatment team. On the day of arrival 3 May 2018 a mental health nurse concluded that there was no need to change his level of support, advised him of how to contact mental health services if necessary, and agreed to visit him again on 5 May 2018. On 4 May 2018 a support worker completed a risk assessment, to which the deceased contributed, and assessed the current risk of suicide as low. The deceased and his wife then had an uneventful and pleasant day out during which he consumed a moderate degree of alcohol. Shortly after his wife left him at the respite centre he text her 'bye' and she alerted a support worker via telephone at 19.26hrs. A combination of the support worker working alone, and the deceased's room key being incorrectly labelled, meant there was a delay of between 25-32 minutes before the door was forced open. This also caused a delay in telephoning 999. The deceased was discovered hanging from a ligature made from a curtain attached to a pole and in cardio-respiratory arrest. The support worker commenced CPR but had to break off for about 80 seconds, again as a consequence of working alone, to answer the door thinking it was the ambulance. CPR was re-commenced and later taken over by paramedics without success and death was confirmed at 20.44hrs. It is impossible to say precisely when the deceased tied the ligature and what if any impact the delay in entering his room had.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a) SUSPENSION BY A LIGATURE AROUND THE NECK","1. Future Care & Social Care Association are a private company that own and run 7 respite homes and secure contracts with the NHS. All referrals come from Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust and Forward Thinking Birmingham. 155 College Road only accommodates mental health patients some of whom will be in or recently out of mental health crisis.

2. Concern 1: At any one time only one support worker is working. The death of Simon Graham identified a number of concerns arising from lone working during an emergency:

A) Upon concern being raised by Simon Graham's wife, the support worker was prevented from promptly checking on his wellbeing because he was with another resident at the medicine cupboard. He had to finish with the other resident and ensure the medicine cupboard was left secure. This caused a delay of about 10-15 minutes before the support worker could check on Simon Graham. Further delay was then caused by confusion over rooms – see below.

B) After forcing entry and finding Simon Graham hanging and in cardiac arrest the support worker got him down and commenced CPR. He had to call for help from other residents but no one came. He had to break off CPR for at least 80 seconds when he ran down three flights of stairs to answer the door thinking it was an ambulance (it was in fact the deceased's wife). I heard evidence that lone working still exists because the current financial contract with the NHS is insufficient to cover the cost of a second support worker, despite Future Care & Social Care Association wanting to end lone working.

3. Concern 2: Support workers were using keys to check on residents in their rooms knowing that they were labelled incorrectly. The fact Simon Graham's room key was incorrectly labelled added to the delayed entry to the room and emergency first aid. I heard evidence that after the death of Simon Graham all keys were checked to ensure they were labelled correctly. However, Future Care & Social Care Association want to implement a key fob system, to avoid any confusion and provide quick access in an emergency, but this has still not been implemented. Further funding would be required to implement a key fob system.

4. Concern 3: When a new patient arrives an unqualified support worker completes a suicide risk assessment based on a) the written observations/risk assessment from mental health Drs/nurses faxed over with the referral and b) talking directly to the resident about their intentions. There is no score system or guide to assist support workers. The support worker who completed the risk assessment for Simon Graham was unable to explain what makes him competent to undertake such an assessment and said in terms that he believes they should be undertaken by a mental health nurse. I heard evidence that unqualified support workers are continuing to undertake suicide risk assessments.

5. Concern 4: Future Care & Social Care Association have identified that support workers should undertake suicide prevention training. I heard evidence that some support workers have still not undertaken this training despite lone working and support workers continuing to undertake suicide risk assessments.

The strain on the systems of Mental Health Services provided by both Forward Thinking Birmingham and Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust has become apparent to the Birmingham and Solihull Coroners in recent months.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 22 June 2018.","On 26 May 2017, the deceased was found in a collapsed and unresponsive condition in the living room at his home address with a .22 calibre long barrelled rifle in his hands and a bullet wound to his forehead.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. Mr Hill was granted a firearms certificate to acquire a firearm on 13 April 2017 by the Firearms Unit at Dorset Police following an application received from him dated 4 November 2016. Following receipt of that certificate Mr Hill acquired a .22 calibre long barrelled rifle which he used to end his life 6 weeks later on 26 May 2017.

ii. Mr Hill’s son had no knowledge of the application his father had made until after it was granted. He and his sister had concerns with their father having access to a firearm, as Mr Hill had told them that when the time came he would end his life by shooting himself with a rifle.

iii. At the time of Mr Hill's application, enquiries were made by Dorset Police which did not include any enquiries with the family of Mr Hill or his wife with whom he was living, although the Firearms Enquiry Officer did see Mrs Hill when she went to interview Mr Hill on 20 March.

iv. There is national guidance from the Home Office called “Guide on Firearms Licensing Law” which was issued in April 2016. Chapter 12 is entitled Assessing Suitability and paragraphs 12.35 to 12.42 deal with applications and background checks to be undertaken. At paragraph 12.35 the Guidance states that “in circumstances where there is information indicating domestic violence or abuse wider interviews or enquiries should be considered with a range of family, friends or associates” prior to the issue of the certificate. There is no further reference to speaking to family members, friends or associates under any other circumstances.

v. Evidence was further given that in the Dorset Police policy entitled ‘Firearms and Explosive Licensing Risk Management Procedure’ dated 8 May 2015 there is no reference to such contact with family members, friends or associates and that family members or those living at the same address of the applicant, will not be contacted as standard practice. They may, as above, be contacted where there is evidence of domestic abuse.

vi. Evidence was given that it would be beneficial for the Firearms Unit at Dorset Police to write to those living with the applicant to invite them to raise any concerns they wish to in relation to the application. Although this may not be responded to, at least it gives those close to the applicant an opportunity to raise their concerns. There may be for example domestic violence ongoing at the address that has not been brought to the Police Force’s attention due to lack of reporting. This would be key to the firearm application.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. When the Police consider a firearm application, there may be valuable information that those close to the applicant may have, in circumstances where there is no domestic abuse or violence. Those living with the applicant may have vital information, which could impact upon the grant of a firearms certificate. This information may therefore be key to preventing a future death.

ii. In view of this I would request that consideration is given to reviewing the national and local guidance in relation to the assessment criteria and enquiries to be considered regarding applications for firearm certificates, and for consideration to be given that those enquiries involve the applicant’s family members, or at the very least those living with the applicant.",True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False

Miller, Chief Executive, Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust; Mr J. Adler, Chief Executive, University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust","On 3 February 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of John Charles Hazlewood.

The inquest concluded on 13 June 2018.","John died 31 January 2017 at [REDACTED], Wigston, Leicestershire.

Narrative conclusion.

John presented to mental health services during January 2017 with increased anxiety and initially was appropriately assessed by his community psychiatric consultant and then by a MHP in the urgent care centre at Leicester emergency department. Despite denying any intention of self-harm, 2 days later he was admitted via the emergency department to the Leicester Royal Infirmary after a mixed overdose of alcohol and cardiac medications. John self-discharged later the same day. No mental health assessment was carried out and this was a missed opportunity to re-evaluate his ongoing care in the light of the material changes in his presentation. No notes were made in the psychiatric record and this caused community safety netting to fail.

John barricaded himself into his garage, significantly self-harmed using hand tools available to him and consumed a large amount of white spirit. He died, notwithstanding emergency assistance, as a result of his actions. He intended to take his own life and understood the consequences of his actions.","1. The court heard that the on call Dr for psychiatry did not have remote access to Mr Hazlewood's medical records and this prevented her from being informed of his significant psychiatric history, and furthermore prevented her from writing a note of her discussions regarding his request to self-discharge. Therefore the knowledge that he had presented again via ED with a serious overdose was not available to his Consultant so an opportunity was missed to escalate his care. Many of the on call team do have remote access and the Leicester Partnership Trust are asked to consider this issue for all relevant clinicians in order to avoid future difficulties of communication.

2. Mr Hazlewood's partner was repeatedly expressed to be his main or only protective factor from self-harm. She was not approached for information regarding his overdose, or her concerns regarding his escalating behaviour and this missed an opportunity for the fuller picture to be captured when considering care planning and mental health assessment. This is an issue that I have raised with the Leicester Partnership Trust before in the matter of [REDACTED] and it appears that carers/families are still not being routinely involved in the care of mentally unwell patients. This can create intolerable pressures upon families and leads to poor outcomes such as in these 2 cases. LPT are urged to consider how this matter can be embedded in training and practice.

3. The court was assured that the induction process had been changed to improve knowledge regarding on call procedures and availability of medical record access. No information was available, via audit, of whether this amended process is successful. LPT should ensure that the outcomes of their welcome changes are being effectively monitored to ensure clinicians have appropriate training and understanding given the frequent rotations of staff and the importance of the on call system being robust and reliable.

4. University Hospitals of Leicester staff, both Dr and nurse gave evidence to the Court that they had not received any training in self harm, notwithstanding they were both highly likely to encounter patients attending with self-inflicted injuries regularly in both the Emergency Department and in the Acute Medical Admissions unit. With self-harm statistics sadly soaring, this is an increasing matter of concern. It is not appropriate to rely on ""buying in"" psychiatric services and leaving front line staff treating patients with no basic knowledge of this complex area and potential triggers. Training would empower the staff and is likely to assist them both in caring for the patients but also the carers/families who may need advice and support. NICE guidelines CG16 is clear that training should be provided to all staff who may encounter such patients and UHL should therefore reconsider this matter.",True,False,True,True,True,False,False,True

Topping,Surrey,"Julie Dawes, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust","An inquest into the death of Mr Henry James Heselton was opened on 7 October 2016 and resumed on 26 January 2018. It was concluded on 4 April 2018. I concluded that Mr Heselton died on 28 September 2016 at Down Lane, Guildford, and that the medical cause of his death was:

1a Hanging

Henry Heselton died at Down Lane, Guildford. He had suffered from paranoid schizophrenia for many years which had been controlled by medication. He had expressed suicidal ideation for many years. It is not possible to find what triggered the relapse of his mental health which led him to take his own life nor whether more proactive mental health support could have prevented his death. He hanged himself on 28 September 2016.

Conclusion as to death;

Suicide","Mr Heselton was born on 30 January 1985. He obtained 2 degrees and worked as an audiologist at Royal Surrey Hospital in Guildford. He was a very conscientious young man. In 2008 he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. His mental health care was provided by a community mental health team from Southern Health NHS. He did not want any treatment to impact on his work. A care plan was put in place which accommodated his wishes and which relied on his mother to be his carer. Mrs Heselton was authorised to liaise with mental health professionals on his behalf. Her contribution was regarded as an integral part of his care plan. In addition, Mr Heselton’s GP surgery made arrangement for Mr Heselton to have regular blood tests because of the medication he was taking. This involved him attending the surgery on a monthly basis and seeing one of the nursing staff. He saw his psychiatrist for annual reviews. He did not want a care co-ordinator.

On Sunday 28 August 2016, on a bank holiday weekend, [REDACTED] rang the East Acute Mental Health Team crisis team run by Southern Health Trust. Her son was in crisis. She sought advice about medication. She said that she thought Mr Heselton might kill himself that day, he could be heard highly distressed in the background. The crisis team was one member of staff short that day. The mental health nurse practitioner answering the phone did not have time to read Mr Heselton’s medical records. She suggested ringing an out of hours GP. No follow up call was made to [REDACTED] and the call was not subject to a multi-disciplinary discussion. Details of the call were forwarded to the community mental health team. They were not at work until the following Tuesday. Mr Heselton’s general practitioner, [REDACTED], was not notified of the call.

On Wednesday 1 September 2016 Mr Heselton’s psychiatrist, [REDACTED], called [REDACTED]. He was informed that Mr Heselton’s mental health had deteriorated but from the information provided by [REDACTED] he did not regard Mr Heselton to be at significant risk. He made an appointment to see Mr Heselton on 23 September 2016 after he had had his blood test at the surgery. This call was not notified to [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] said she thought Mr Heselton would not attend the psychiatric appointment.

On 7 September 2016 Mrs Heselton called [REDACTED] to discuss Mr Heselton’s mental health and ask about medication. From the information she was given [REDACTED] did not think Mr Heselton was actively suicidal. That assessment was made without [REDACTED] having been made aware of the 2 recent contacts with [REDACTED]. She was therefore not able to make a fully informed decision about Mr Heselton’s treatment and was not able to undertake a fully informed risk analysis.

On 23 September 2016 Mr Heselton attended at the surgery to have his blood tested but did not attend his psychiatric appointment. On 27 September 2016 [REDACTED] was unable to contact Mr Heselton. She tried to call the police but did not use 999. She feared he had killed himself. The following day she was notified that Mr Heselton had not arrived for work. She called the police and Mr Heselton was found in a field off Down Lane Guildford. He had hanged himself. [REDACTED] told the police he had been talking about killing himself for 4 days.

An investigation by Southern Health Trust concluded that there had been a missed opportunity to engage with Mr Heselton and to have a mental health assessment on 28 August 2016. In addition, that it was essential that staff answering crisis calls familiarise themselves with the patient’s mental health records.

Professor Fox a Consultant Psychiatrist gave evidence as an expert at the inquest. In his view the 3 contacts with [REDACTED] should have raised alarm about Mr Heselton’s mental state. More should have been done to engage and support [REDACTED] and communication should have been better between the crisis team and the community mental health team, and with [REDACTED]. He accepted that, given Mr Heselton’s reluctance to engage with mental health services, the decision whether to undertake a mental health assessment of Mr Heselton was a difficult one and may have undermined his therapeutic relationships with the mental health professionals.","1. The electronic mental health records were unclear. Vital information about Mr Heselton’s mental health history, including that he had attempted suicide in the past, was difficult to find. His most recent care plan did not record this. The information was not easy to extract for professionals needing to find information about a patient in a crisis.

2. There was a lack of communication between the mental health teams and the general practitioner. The fact that contact had been made by [REDACTED] with both the acute and community mental health team was not shared with his general practitioner. This left her without relevant recent history to inform her clinical judgement when she was contacted by [REDACTED] on 7 September 2016.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

Although this change was communicated orally to Katy and her family, it was not confirmed in writing and little, if any opportunity was provided to appeal this decision to alter Katy’s care plan, despite the family’s increasing concerns over its appropriateness for Katy. Consequently, at the time of her death Katy was under a care plan believed by the family to be unsuitable for her, thereby exacerbating a breakdown of trust on the part of Katy’s family in the service provided by CAMHS/SLAM and creating a lack of provision for care or advice when a crisis, due to unexpected circumstances arose.","(1) Failure to communicate in writing a care plan and changes to it.

Lambeth Hub contacted Wandsworth IAPT with a view to requesting that psychological therapy be re-started and an appointment was made for 24 August 2016.

The Trust's own findings identified a number of issues and a number of proposed actions.

1. Edward Lundy had contact with many professionals in a short period of time and that affected the continuity of his care. Proposed action to set up joint services review with provider organisations involved with an oversight report to be produced.

2. That upon Edward Lundy’s discharge into the care of his family, there should have been independent consultation with the family and this should have been documented with the risks being explicitly discussed. Proposed action to ensure that the Psychiatric Liaisons Operational Policy stated as such and to disseminate to all liaison teams via pathway meetings and local business meetings.

3. That the doctor referring Edward to the Lambeth Assessment and Liaison Team should have made it clear that he believed Edward should be seen by a psychiatrist. Proposed action that the Training Lead in the Trust be informed that GP trainees should receive risk management training, focussing on crisis intervention services e.g. when to consider CMHT/Home Treatment Team/Inpatient Admission.

(2) With regard to the contact with the care co-ordinator on 11/8/17 the failure to record the concerns of Mr Sloan’s daughter was a fundamental omission which also represented a missed opportunity to put in place supportive measures which may have prevented the suicide.

That was concluded at the end of the inquest on 3 November 2017. The conclusion of the jury after the inquest was:

Medical cause of death:

Single stab wound to chest

How, when and where the deceased came by his death:

Whilst suffering from un-medicated paranoid schizophrenia and during an attempt by police officers to exercise a warrant obtained under section 135 Mental Health Act 1983, Ryan Vout stabbed himself in the left side of the chest with a knife. The knife penetrated the left lung and the left ventricle of the heart.
Ryan then removed the knife at the request of a police officer.
Despite emergency first aid and hospital treatment Ryan died at 14:28 on 10 August 2016 at Kingsmill Hospital, Sutton in Ashfield.

Conclusion of the jury as to death:

Ryan Vout died as a result of a self-inflicted stab wound administered whilst suffering from un-medicated paranoid schizophrenia.","Since about the end of 2006/beginning of 2007, Ryan had been diagnosed with what [REDACTED], Community Consultant Psychiatrist, described as relapsing and remitting paranoid schizophrenia accompanied by persecutory ideas about the police; auditory hallucinations; grandiose thoughts and speech.
His condition tended to be well controlled when he maintained his drug regimen. During the intervening 9 ½ years prior to Ryan’s death his symptoms fluctuated requiring occasional, sometimes extensive, periods as an inpatient.
Immediately before his discharge on 1 August 2016, Ryan had been an inpatient at Millbrook Hospital, Nottinghamshire since 5 May 2016.
Concerns were quickly raised by family and community mental health professionals that Ryan’s mental health had deteriorated in the 7 or 8 days or so since his discharge from Millbrook Hospital. Most likely, (on the basis of evidence of the absence of any trace of prescribed anti-psychotic medication (here risperidone) in the post mortem toxicological samples), Ryan had stopped taking his oral medication.
On 9 August 2016, [REDACTED] (Approved Mental Health Practitioner (AMHP)) began the process of obtaining a warrant under s.135 (1) MHA 1983, informed local police of his intention to do so and made arrangements to meet officers so that the warrant could be executed.
The warrant was obtained in the morning of 10 August 2016. PB informed the police and arrangements made to meet at the address at which it was believed Ryan would be found.
At around 1pm on [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] met at the relevant address and prepared to exercise the warrant. By reason of some information exchange, but in the absence of formal risk assessment, all were aware that Ryan had expressed views that he would take his own life if he saw a police officer (attempt to ‘section’ him) and that knives might be secreted at the property.
Body worn camera footage and audio obtained by [REDACTED] revealed that, as the officers made their way into the premises and announced their arrival, Ryan expressed fear at their presence and then retreated into an upstairs bedroom where he plunged a kitchen knife into his chest which, as it transpired, damaged his left lung and punctured the left ventricle. Emergency first aid and hospitalisation could not save Ryan.
From call out following [REDACTED] radio request, the EMAS emergency ambulance took six minutes to arrive at the address.
In the course of the evidence it became clear that it was not possible to ‘pre-book’ an ambulance as the most appropriate means of transport for a potential psychiatric patient. The evidence also revealed that the competing emergency calls made upon the local ambulance provider (EMAS) meant that such pre-arrangement was incompatible with delivery of an emergency service. Although ambulances could be arranged once the AMHP and police officers arrived at the location where the warrant was to be exercised that request would not be treated as an emergency or a high priority (in the absence of threat to life).
All interested parties, especially the police, expressed frustration that within Nottinghamshire there is no alternative, dedicated, fully equipped ambulance, capable of being pre-booked for attendances such as the one in this case for the execution of s.135 MHA 1983 warrants (or detention under s136 MHA 1983).

Additionally, prior to Ryan’s discharge from hospital, no meeting took place between the treating psychiatrist and the community psychiatrist; Ryan’s care co-ordinator had moved jobs and not been replaced; and Ryan’s family were not informed of the discharge.
Although evidence was heard to say that the Trust now has a full complement of community psychiatric nurses, it was not clear whether a formal discharge protocol existed or has since been brought into being so that patients are not discharged until contact between professionals and family has been established.","(1) The lack of a co-ordinated discharge from in-patient psychiatric care into the community, in particular the failure of appropriate professionals from hospital and community to liaise and for family to be informed as a pre-requisite for discharge;
(2) The inability to pre-arrange attendance of an ambulance when police officers exercise a s.135 (1) MHA Act 1983 warrant;
(3) The lack of formality to the ‘briefing’ or risk assessment exercise before officers enter premises with a view to exercising a s.135 (1) MHA Act 1983 warrant.",True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False

Sofia was aged 14 years when she died on 26 September 2016. The medical cause of death was hanging. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, that on 20 September 2016 at 25 Saxon Way, Cheddar, Sofia deliberately suspended herself by the neck with the intention of ending her life.","Sofia had previously suffered from low mood. In Year 8 both school and family noticed significant changes in Sofia’s behaviour, including self-harming. Sofia’s mother was sufficiently concerned to attend the family G.P., who wrote to CAMHS West supporting a referral from Sofia’s school. By letter dated 2 April 2015 CAMHS West stated that Sofia’s difficulties did not meet criteria for specialist CAMHS intervention.

In February 2016 Sofia attended her G.P. with her mother, Sofia’s hair was starting to break, her self-confidence fell as her hair became thinner. Sofia and her mother returned to the G.P. a number of times and in June 2016 the G.P. agreed if Sofia was stressed, it was documented that Sofia has been low for months, was self-harming again but denied any suicidal thoughts. Following an attendance at the G.P. on 12 July 2016 it was noted that Sofia has expressed some suicidal thoughts. An expert referral was made to CAMHS West. Sofia was seen by a care-co-ordinator at CAMHS West on 15 July 2016 and again on 29 July 2016. Sofia was given the opportunity to speak to the care coordinator alone. Sofia was placed on a 6 month waiting list for CBT. Sofia’s mother appeared to her mother to have a good summer holiday but upon returning to school in September 2016 Sofia started to isolate herself. Sofia’s mother arranged an appointment with Sofia’s care coordinator at CAMHS on 19 September 2016. Again Sofia had the chance to speak to the care co-ordinator alone and again Sofia admitted to suicidal thoughts. From the evidence of the care co-ordinator and Sofia’s mother it was identified that there was a difference in recollection of what was discussed and expressed at that meeting. Matters that the care coordinator identified as discussed were not subsequently identified in Sofia’s care plan, the care co-ordinator has no urgent contact with Sofia’s school and no urgent contact with a psychiatrist. No follow up appointment was made. On the following day 26 September 2016 Sofia’s mother following discussions with Sofia attended work and upon return home discovered Sofia hanging. Sofia left an apologetic ‘suicide note’.","1. Access to CAMHS. Sofia was rejected for referral in April 2015. Might a lower threshold and earlier proactive interventionist policy have been of positive benefit to Sofia.

2. Availability of CBT. Sofia was placed on a 6 month waiting list for CBT. This delay appears considerable.

3. Sofia’s care co-ordinator at CAMHS did not obtain the urgent input of a psychiatrist in accordance with NICE guidance.

4. The recollections of Sofia’s care co-ordinator and Sofia’s mother as to the meeting of 19 September were at odds with each other. Sofia’s care co-ordinator recollected in her evidence telling Sofia’s mother that Sofia was not to be left alone. Sofia’s mother deemed the impression from Sofia’s care co-ordinator’s evidence was of Sofia being in an extremely vulnerable and dangerous position but this was not reflected in Sofia’s care plan which made no mention of her not being left alone and it was not reflected in the care co-ordinator’s actions in not urgently contacting Sofia’s school, where she would be during the following days, or a psychiatrist. Her care plan appears to be the critical written record of the outcomes of this meeting as it was not of sufficient detail to safeguard Sofia.

5. Language used in the SIRI Report was felt to be inappropriate. The SIRI Report effectively said if the care plan had been followed the outcome might have been different and that no change in clinical practice would have resulted in any different outcome. I do not believe either of these statements were true.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

Salter,Oxfordshire,"Mr Stuart Bell CBE, Chief Executive of Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust","I concluded the inquest into the sad death of Liam Thomas at Oxford Coroner’s Court on 28 July 2017. Mr Thomas died at Littlemore Hospital Oxford on 28 August 2016. The jury returned a narrative conclusion as follows:

Liam was found in a shower room of the Phoenix Ward of Littlemore Hospital with plastic bags over his head, secured in place with a shoelace, at about 14:00 on 28 August 2016, and pronounced dead at 15:21 at the John Radcliffe Hospital the same day. The cause of death was asphyxiation.

At this time, Liam intended to take his own life. This intention was formed at a time when his mind was disturbed and the following inadequacies in the provision of mental health care at Littlemore Hospital contributed to his death: failure to ensure patients' safety in relation to a banned item (plastic bags) and failure to manage items identified by staff to be of individual personal risk to Liam (ligature items).

There was written and oral evidence at the inquest which included evidence from nursing staff and doctors from the Trust together with [REDACTED] Head of Nursing for the Adult Directorate. The Trust were legally represented at the inquest. A full copy of the inquest file was provided in advance. I have not therefore provided you with a full copy of the inquest file with this letter.","The circumstances are briefly set out above in the narrative conclusion. As you will know, Liam was 21 years old when he died on 28 August 2016. CPR was carried out and he was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital by ambulance but he was pronounced dead soon after arrival. He was a single man who lived with his mother and sister in Didcot. He worked in ICT as a Programming Developer. Liam had suffered with mental health problems before his death including thoughts of taking his own life. He was detained under Section 2 of The Mental Health Act 1983 on 11 August 2016 and remained an inpatient on the Phoenix Ward at Littlemore hospital until his sad death.","The matters of concern are in relation to plastic bags/restricted items and, secondly, communications with family.

I recognise that lessons have already been learnt following Liam’s death as set out in the Root Cause Analysis investigation and, specifically, in the action plan. Ms Klink gave further evidence about this.

In relation to the first concern, about plastic bags as restricted items on the ward, the sad fact is that Liam was able to take his own life because he had access to plastic bags. They were Sainsbury’s bags. He attended Sainsbury’s on Section 17 leave two days prior to his death. There was evidence that these bags were taken from him on return to the ward. It could not be ascertained if this was correct and whether the bags which Liam used were bags which he obtained on the trip to Sainsbury’s or whether the bags were obtained in some other way on the ward. I understand there have been improvements in the system in relation to plastic bags in particular. I appreciate however that the problem of plastic bags is not straightforward, particularly when one takes into account the fact that many patients are informal patients and are free to leave and return and that visitors may also bring plastic bags when visiting. I understand that there are clear warnings that plastic bags are restricted items at the entrance to the ward and that steps are taken to bring this to the attention of visitors. It would be helpful if I could be provided with further details about the steps that are in place.

A related concern was the environmental searches that were intended, amongst other things, to check for plastic bags. I was shown what are referred to as daily environmental safety checklists which include plastic bags/bin liners on them. I had the impression from the evidence that, at the time, these checks were not being carried out as regularly as they should be. Indeed, I see that recommendation 2 on the RCA/Action Plan concerns standardising the frequency of environmental checks and monitoring of banned items across all inpatient wards. It states that they should be carried out daily. It appears a policy is in place and a recommendation but it is not clear to me whether there is effective implementation. Consequently I request that this matter be reviewed and that I receive a response specifically about implementation.

The second area of concern is about communication with family. Again, I realise that this is not a straightforward matter because there are issues of consent and it is also the case that some families are not supportive or united. However, in Liam’s case, it is clear that his family were very supportive and united in terms of Liam’s health and wellbeing. A concern at inquest from the evidence was that there was a need for improved communication in terms of information provided by family to staff and also from the staff (particularly concerning elevated risk) to family members. This will enable family to be more watchful. [REDACTED] in her evidence, referred to the “triangular approach” and recognised that there was more work to be done in this difficult area. She indicated that work was ongoing. It would be helpful if you could provide details about the current policy and practice concerning communications with family and if there is a programme in place, to improve it.",False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False

Hassell,London Inner North,"Medical Director, East London NHS Foundation Trust","On 13 March 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Janet Williams, aged 54 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 September 2017. I made a determination as follows.

Janet Williams’ death was the result of suicide. She hanged herself at home whilst suffering late onset paranoid schizophrenia. This had developed a little over a year before her death. During that time, despite very significant efforts by family members, there was a healthcare professional failure properly to monitor and therefore to assess and treat Ms Williams appropriately.","Ms Williams became ill in early 2016 and was referred to mental health services by her general practitioner. She was admitted to Brick Lane Ward at the Tower Hamlets Centre for Mental Health on 9 March 2016 as a voluntary patient and discharged to the home treatment team on 8 April. She was under the care of the home treatment team until 29 April, and then again from 16 September until 11 October 2016.","1. Ms Williams’ care plan approach (CPA) was not recorded on the computer system and so there were no automatic alerts generated when she was not seen for review at the appropriate times. The lack of computer record of her CPA was never noted.

2. Ms Williams told her care co-ordinator that she was no longer hearing voices, but her daughter raised concerns that this was not true. Ms Williams’ care co-ordinator did not at any point in April 2016 or afterwards raise this with Ms Williams, but instead accepted Ms Williams’ narrative as accurate.

3. Ms Williams was not reviewed in accordance with the protocol for a person on a CPA. A medical review with her consultant psychiatrist scheduled for 12 May 2016 was cancelled by her care co-ordinator. The reason given was that the psychiatrist was unwell, though in fact she was not.

4. A meeting was then scheduled three months away, for 9 August 2016, despite the need for medical review and the lack of any alternative arrangement in the meantime.

5. Between 11 October 2016 when Ms Williams was discharged by the home treatment team, to 21 February 2017 when she saw her general practitioner and her care co-ordinator together, Ms Williams’ care co-ordinator did not meet with her.

6. Between 11 October 2016 when Ms Williams was discharged by the home treatment team, and her death on 8 March 2017, Ms Williams’ care co-ordinator did not arrange for a medical review by the psychiatrist.

7. When Ms Williams’ family attempted to raise concerns with her care co-ordinator, at times their calls were not returned and at other times their concerns were simply not acted upon. She had recently been diagnosed with a very serious mental health condition, but she was not monitored with sufficient care or in some instances at all, and she was therefore not assessed or treated appropriately.

8. Finally, as I know you are aware, the care co-ordinator made several retrospective entries in the medical records that she did not record as being made retrospectively. These entries were made up to eleven months after events, and were made after Ms Williams’ death and mostly after my request for a statement from the care co-ordinator in preparation for the inquest.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Cause of death
1a) Hanging

Conclusion -

Callum Smith's death, caused by suicide whilst suffering extreme anxiety and distress was contributed to by the following:

• Inadequate attention to the concerns of Callum's family, his own requests for help and for communication with his family, the level of his anxiety and acts of self-harm whilst in police and prison custody.

• Failure to record key events on the PER and to include health and mental health records on transfer to prison

• Inadequate communication between those involved in Callum's care.

• Inadequate mental health assessment and failure to carry out a timely full mental health assessment and to ensure proper referrals took place with handover.

• Repeated failures to open an ACCT due to lack of training, inadequate training and staff understanding, failure to take responsibility for the opening of an ACCT and failure to recognise that self-harm extends to intentionally banging head against a wall or door.

• Inadequate integration between and access to IT systems which led to key information being missed

• Failure to support Callum by not allowing a follow-up assessment to take place.",Callum was in the care of HMP Bristol at the time of his death. He was found hanging in his cell by a prison officer.,"1. At the conclusion of the inquest I expressed my concern in relation to assessing risk of suicide and self-harm and how from the evidence heard it appeared that there was a possible conflict between how healthcare/mental healthcare staff assess risk in this area and the requirements of the ACCT policy for all staff working with prisoners to follow the requirements of PSI 64/2011.

2. There was evidence that healthcare/mental healthcare staff needed to be reminded of the lower threshold for opening an ACCT and that this is fundamentally different to the way that they carry out an assessment and/or risk assessment of a patient's risk of suicide or self-harm for medical/mental health care and treatment as per PSI 64/2011.

3. I was concerned that staff who apparently had been trained did not appear to consider that they had when giving evidence and therefore I would ask that this is reviewed to ensure that healthcare/mental healthcare staff receive detailed training on the ACCT process as it is clearly an important and recognised policy in preventing a risk of self-harm or suicide.

4. I indicated that I would ensure that this report was copied to the prison as they would need to be aware of this, as it is often they who provide the ACCT training for healthcare/mental healthcare staff.",True,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

McLoughlin,London Inner West,"The Rt Hon Amber Rudd, The Secretary of State for the Home Department; Governor of HMP Wandsworth","On 30 November 2015 an investigation was commenced into the death of Jonathan David Palmer ('Mr Palmer'). On 18 May 2017 I concluded the investigation at the end of an 8 day inquest, sitting with a jury. The jury returned a narrative conclusion.","On 3 June 2015 Mr Palmer was brought to HMP Wandsworth on remand prior to a trial which was listed to commence on 23 November 2015. On 19 November 2015 at approximately 1400 hours Mr Palmer's lifeless body was discovered suspended from a ligature in his cell. He was declared dead at 14.58 hours, after resuscitation efforts were abandoned. The Inquest found the cause of death to be 1a Hanging.

In the period between June and November 2015 Mr Palmer had exhibited bizarre and violent behaviour. The prison and medical staff attributed his behaviour to the effects of an illicit drug, Spice. Mr Palmer's family (including his two brothers who were also held on remand and shared a cell with him for part of the time) were convinced that he was experiencing a developing psychotic illness in addition to his pre-existing psychiatric conditions. The Narrative conclusion returned by the jury did not make a finding on the balance of probability as to whether his behaviour prior to his death should be ascribed to the misuse of illicit drugs, an emerging psychotic illness or a combination of the two.

Mr Palmer's community GP records were not obtained and hence those responsible for his assessment and treatment in the prison from June 2015 onwards, had little information available as regards his previous medical history. Relevant aspects would have included his suicidal ideation in earlier years and the diagnosis of a major depressive illness, approximately four months before he was remanded in prison.

Mr Palmer's family gave evidence that they endeavoured to make the prison aware of their concerns about his mental health in numerous telephone calls to safer custody, RAPt and the prison chaplains, as well as posting documents to the prison governor, but the records available from chaplains and others did not enable the Inquest to determine the date, nature and value of all of the information alleged to have been sent to the prison.

Evidence taken at the Inquest indicated that Mr Palmer admitted at various times to having smoked Spice. The Jury did not, however, find any causal link between any illicit drug usage and the death.

One prisoner asserted in the course of his evidence that contraband material is smuggled into the prison by corrupt individuals, but the investigation of this matter was outside the scope of the Inquest.","1. There is no effective system by which the family of a prisoner can input information they deem relevant to a prisoner's health needs and be assured this will be disseminated to relevant teams within the prison, with appropriate records being maintained in order to be able to demonstrate this has been done.

Families can be a source of valuable medical information, particularly where GP records have not been obtained and the individual himself may not be a reliable source. It would be beneficial to have a clear, publicised conduit for a family to provide relevant medical information to a specified department. The Inquest was informed that a single point of contact has now been established, but it remains unclear whether comprehensive records of all contacts will be maintained, or whether this will result in the timely dissemination of information to those with a role in the prisoner's welfare, such as healthcare staff, RAPt or the chaplains. As the Personal Officer scheme appears to have been abandoned at HMP Wandsworth there is no alternative individual for a concerned family to approach.

2. The steps taken to control the inflow of contraband material into the prison (such as the illicit drug known as Spice) appear ineffective.

Insidious substances such as Spice can mimic the symptoms of psychotic illness and jeopardise life when unpredictable reactions occur to those using it. Spice is also likely to adversely affect discipline within the prison, create the potential for intra-prisoner bullying (arising from drug debts) and stretch already depleted healthcare resources. In order to combat this menace, steps should be taken to identify the entry points in order that they can be more effectively controlled and those involved, deterred.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Hewitt,London City,North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust,"I commenced an investigation into the death of Charlotte Anne Agnew which was concluded at the end of the inquest on 31 January 2017.

My conclusion as to the death was :

“Suicide.

The deceased’s suicide was possibly contributed to by the failure of North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust to (i) provide any psychiatric treatment and care after 16 February 2016, despite a recognised urgent need for the same, and (ii) put in place any plan for the management of her risk of suicide.”","The circumstances of Charlotte Agnew’s death can be summarised as follows:

Charlotte Agnew became psychiatrically unwell in late 2015 and her symptoms worsened over the following weeks. On 9 February 2016 her General Practitioner referred her to the North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust’s psychiatric services on the basis that she may be suffering a psychosis. The Trust was also made aware that the Deceased was experiencing suicidal ideation. On 15 February 2016 she was assessed by the Trust’s Early Intervention and Assertive Psychosis Team who recognised that she was in need of psychiatric treatment and care but decided that it was not appropriate for her to be managed by the EIAP team. The Deceased was referred on to other psychiatric teams within the Trust but no effective transfer of her care was made and her case was closed. No plan was put in place to manage the Deceased’s risk of suicide. On 15 March 2016 the Deceased’s General Practitioner made a further referral to the Trust’s psychiatric services, seeking an urgent assessment. The Trust’s Access and Assessment Team provided an appointment for 20 April 2016. In the days prior to her death on 25 March 2016 the Deceased again expressed suicidal ideation but on the morning of 25 March she did not display to her family signs of being acutely suicidal. In the afternoon the Deceased travelled to London, ingested dangerously high levels of alcohol and medication and, at approximately 4.00pm, jumped in to the path of a London Underground tube train as it entered Chancery Lane station.","It was apparent from the evidence that there were five principal failures by the Trust in relation to the treatment and care provided to the Deceased. These were:

(1) The Deceased was first assessed by the Trust’s Early Intervention and Assertive Psychosis Team who recognised that she was in need of psychiatric treatment and care by another team but, despite referring her on to other psychiatric teams within the Trust, made no effective transfer of her care before discharging her back to her General Practitioner and closing her case. A significant number of clinical and managerial staff were involved in this process and none of them prevented the Deceased’s premature discharge.

(2) Prior to the Deceased’s discharge no sufficient assessment was made of her risk of suicide. Despite at least two clinical staff being involved, there was insufficient evidence gathering, including from the Deceased’s family, and a wholly inadequate assessment was made despite the use of the Trust’s electronic assessment tool (which was not properly completed). Further, no plan was put in place to manage the Deceased’s recognised risk of suicide.

(3) Prior to the Deceased’s discharge no care plan was put in place and no single person had responsibility for ensuring her care was properly assessed, co-ordinated and delivered prior to discharge.

(4) The Deceased was discharged back to the care of her General Practitioner with a recommendation for the prescription of psychiatric medication without her having been seen or assessed by the psychiatrist who made the recommendation and with no means of monitoring its subsequent effectiveness.

(5) Despite the matters set out in (1) to (4), the General Practitioner’s request, made on 15 March 2016, for an urgent assessment was not granted and the Trust’s Access and Assessment Team provided an appointment for a date five weeks later on 20 April 2016.

I was told by witnesses from the Trust (and in submissions made on behalf of the Trust) that the Trust had adequate relevant policies and procedures in place at the time and that the failings set out above occurred because all the staff involved failed to follow those policies and procedures. It was said that there has been no subsequent amendment of the policies and procedures but, in summary, that staff have been reminded of them and what ought to happen (by email) and there is now an increased level of monitoring of compliance.

Whilst the staff directly involved, who gave oral evidence at the inquest, told me that they now understand that the above failings ought not to have happened and would not occur now, I remain concerned that one or more of the above failings could recur in the future. Although the Trust has taken steps to inform current staff of what went wrong in the Deceased’s case, it has not taken steps to ensure that the above failings could not occur again (whether by amendment or clarification of its policies and/or procedures or sufficient training of staff or otherwise).

Most particularly, the evidence provided to me did not satisfy me that the Trust’s policies and procedures, and the training given upon them, now ensure that every patient who is referred to the Trust will be assessed and treated in a timely manner, even if transfer between teams is necessary. Nor did it satisfy me that every patient’s risk of suicide is now properly assessed and managed so as to ensure the risk is minimised.

In all the circumstances I consider that there is an ongoing risk that any one or more of the above failings could recur. If that risk is permitted to continue, it could have an adverse impact on the assessment, treatment and care of current and future patients and upon the protection of their lives.",True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False

1a multiple injuries including ruptured left kidney.","Mariana Pinto jumped from the third floor balcony of her home as a deliberate act, but without a proper understanding of what she was doing.

She had attended the emergency department of the Homerton University Hospital the day before and had been assessed as not detainable under the Mental Health Act.

On the day of her death, her husband called the City and Hackney Crisis Line at lunch time and was told that she would receive a home visit between 5 and 7pm. He then called back at 3.32pm, explaining that his wife was deteriorating rapidly and needed to see someone urgently.

Half an hour later, Mariana Pinto jumped.","1. It seemed to me at inquest that, when Ms Pinto left the emergency department the day before her death, the limitations of the crisis team were not made clear to her family and friends.

2. The view of the psychiatrists treating Ms Pinto in the emergency department was that she was suffering cannabis withdrawal, which I heard is generally at its worst during the first three days.

Her symptoms were now quiescent, but it would have been very helpful for her family to know that, most particularly as she had taken cannabis the night before, once the lorazepam wore off she might well have a resurgence of symptoms though these were not expected to be as severe as they had been. Worsening advice could then have been delivered in this context, with a clear plan of action.

It is a theme I have noticed in deaths such as Ms Pinto’s, that clinicians’ expectations of illness progression are not necessarily communicated effectively to families, to enable families to identify unexpected deterioration and then to act swiftly and appropriately.

3. The band 7 mental health nurse who took the call to the crisis line at 3.32pm on 16 October, did not suggest to Ms Pinto’s husband that [REDACTED] call the emergency services while the nurse rang Ms Pinto and spoke to her to offer what support he could.

When [REDACTED] told him that the situation was now urgent, the nurse responded that the time for home visits was 5-7pm.

Beasley-Murray,Essex,Her Majesty’s Prison Service; Care UK Clinical Services; South Essex Partnership Trust; NHS England,"On 5 January 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dean Gary Saunders. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 January 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was:
Dean Gary Saunders killed himself whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed and the cause of death was contributed to by neglect. The jury provided in addition the following narrative conclusion: This has been an extremely challenging case; the jury would first like to express its sincere condolences to Dean’s family.

We believe that a number of serious failings led to Dean’s death and we set out these as follows. There is no particular significance to the order in which we present them.

The mental health assessment at Basildon police station was not adequate due to a failure to pass information pertinent to Dean’s then mental state and its consequent risks. The delay in carrying out the assessment contributed to this serious failing.

While we do not believe that the result of the assessment itself was predetermined, the pathway to prison was.

On the balance of limited evidence and lack of a proper audit trail we are unable to conclude whether sufficient enquiries were made into the availability of beds out of area or privately. The only certainty is that a bed at Brockfield House was only available on 4 January 2016.

It was clear Dean was in need of a place of safety, as such his route from Basildon police station to prison was the only available option.

In our view the ACCT assessment on 21 December 2015 was not adequately conducted for the following reasons:

• No medical or mental health professional attended the assessment;
• The assessment did not have sufficient multi-disciplinary attendance;
• The head of healthcare had, to a very large extent, predetermined that the result of the assessment would be the removal of constant watch;
• The head of healthcare treated financial considerations as a significant reason to reduce the level of observations;
• The attendees at the assessment failed to review sufficient background information prior to the assessment, including full and detailed knowledge of key events such as the plastic bag incident, which had taken place moments before the ACCT review;
• The assessment was held prior to the completion of the psychiatrist’s assessment.

HMP Chelmsford’s response to the family in general and on 23 December 2015 in particular was inadequate.

These include but are not limited to basic administrative errors, such as a failure to record and pass on telephone numbers, failure to record all information, failure to initiate usage of the phone PIN system, and no consideration of family attendance at ACCT assessments which we feel would have been appropriate in the circumstances.

At HMP Chelmsford, there were multiple failings in recording and communicating pertinent information relating to Dean’s circumstances. These included but are not limited to:

• Discrepancies between various official records;
• Failure to provide full explanations in recorded entries;
• Failure to record key incidents;
• A complacent approach to Dean’s state of mind and circumstances.

There was an absence of clinical leadership in the healthcare wing of HMP Chelmsford. There was confusion regarding the head of healthcare’s qualifications by members of staff.

The administration and performance of ACCT reviews was wholly inconsistent and record keeping incomplete. Such as confirming a case manager throughout the ACCT, confirming risk level on 24 December and other information that must be completed in every case.

Finally there was a total lack of consistency and logic regarding the level of risk ascribed to Dean’s situation and consequent levels of observation.

On 4 January 2016, the performance of the observations was perfunctory as the member of staff did not engage with Dean as required in the PSI and checks were not carried out on an irregular basis.

There was a failure to transfer Dean to a medical facility as the section 48 process in operation at HMP Chelmsford is contrary to industry best practice.

In addition the psychiatric assessment on 21 December failed to take into account the fact that Dean’s observation levels had been reduced at the ACCT meeting earlier that day.

In summary, Dean Saunders and his family were let down by serious failings in both mental health care and the prison system.","Dean Saunders was 25 years old at the time of his death. On 16 December 2015 he was detained under s136 Mental Health Act and assessed at Rochford Hospital. He was discharged to his parents’ home where an incident took place involving him stabbing two family members and threatening to make his own life. He was arrested and taken to Basildon Police Station. On 17 December 2016 Mr Saunders was assessed and not made subject to a section of the Mental Health Act. He was charged with two counts of attempted murder and after an appearance in Basildon Magistrates’ Court, he was remanded in custody to HM Prison Chelmsford. An ACCT – Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork - document was opened. He was initially placed under constant supervision but this was later reduced to twice hourly observations. Seven ACCT reviews were held between 18 and 31 December. At 10.25am on 4 January 2016 Dean was found unresponsive lying on a mattress in his cell. His death was confirmed and the cause of death provided by the pathologist, was 1a) electrocution","1. FOR SEPT: The admitted lacuna in the SEPT admissions protocol governing the transfer of mentally disordered people from police custody. The current admissions protocol does not allow for the transfer of any individual from police custody, irrespective of the criminal charges the individual is facing.

2. FOR SEPT AND NHS ENGLAND: The absence of a written record of the “best practice” forensic pathway referred to by [REDACTED] in his evidence, and consideration of whether the transfer of individuals such as Dean to prison is indeed “best practice”, taking into account the consequent delay in transfer and the suitability of the prison environment for mentally disordered individuals.

3. FOR CARE UK, NOMS, SEPT: The lack of clarity regarding the hospital transfer process. The evidence at the inquest demonstrated that this is currently shrouded in confusion and contradiction (if the PSI and the NHS England “good practice” is compared). Given that rationalisation of the process is still a “work in progress”, the family consider that it should be given urgent consideration.

4327,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/rachel-morgan/,2017-0055,2017-02-09,A. Morris,Greater Manchester South,Chief Executive of Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Trust,On 25 April 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rachel Morgan. The investigation concluded on 9 February 2017 and the conclusion reached by the jury was one of suicide with an appended narrative. The medical cause of death was 1a) Severe anoxic brain injury.,"Prior to the birth of her second baby, Rachel was healthy, did not like taking medication and had no previous mental health issues. After the birth she became increasingly unwell with fluctuating moods and emotions, which led to her seeking medical help. She made two suicide attempts, after which she was admitted to hospital. After each admission she was discharged under the care of home-based community teams. She was diagnosed with post-natal depression with psychotic symptoms, which gradually worsened, with some fluctuations. Rachel had fears of harm coming to her baby but became increasingly detached from her, though there was no concern that she was a threat to her children. The mother and baby unit was discussed on several occasions with one referral put on hold awaiting a multi-disciplinary team meeting. Immediately prior to her admission in April, her partner and mother did not feel they could keep her safe in the community. Rachel attended an outpatient's appointment on the 12th April to review her medications. During this appointment, the clinician's ongoing concerns were heightened by the knowledge that she had been ordering drugs on the internet to end her life. Rachel did not want to be admitted to hospital so went home, where she was restrained until professionals arrived. She was taken to hospital under an emergency section 4 of the mental health act due to the unavailability of a second opinion doctor at that time. The approved mental health professional provided a verbal handover to the ward staff, highlighting Rachel's history and her current high risk. There were contradictory accounts of the content of the handover and there were possible omissions in the handover which were not fully documented. Rachel was admitted to the ward by a section 12 doctor, observed by the clerking doctor. A risk assessment was completed by nursing staff who initially put her on amber risk of suicide, which was updated to red soon thereafter. She was put on level three observations and allocated a primary nurse who was on nights. During her time on the ward, she was assessed to be engaging and talking to staff but had constant thoughts to end her life. Concerns were raised by nursing staff about her preoccupation with a Nicorette Inhalator, concerns which were recorded on the PARIS system but were not included in an updated risk assessment. They were not shared with doctors prior to the ward round. On the 15th April the family highlighted specific concerns regarding Rachel's safety which were discussed by nursing staff, updated on the PARIS records but were not added to the risk assessment. The levels of observation were not raised. Despite Rachel's and her family's repeated requests to review and change her medication, this was continually delayed and no immediate action was taken. Rachel was found at approximately 10.20am on 16th April 2016 in room 7 of the Medlock ward, Moorside unit.

Four nurses attempted to open the door to Rachel's room, one of whom entered to find Rachel slumped behind the door with a ligature around her neck. A crash team and ambulance staff were called and CPR was commenced. Rachel was transferred to Salford Royal Hospital at approximately 11.20am and died from severe anoxic brain injury on 24th April 2016.

The Jury concluded that Rachel died as a result of suicide and recorded the following narrative conclusion:

Suicide and Narrative: The level of observations on the day Rachel was admitted were insufficient. The Trust has accepted that on 12th April the level of observations should have been considered on admission and a decision to place Rachel on enhanced observations would not have been unreasonable. The information relating to Rachel's conversation with the nurse on 14th April regarding the Nicorette inhalator should have been handed over to the clinicians conducting the ward round on 15th April. It is possible that had this information been available, the clinician may have altered the level of observations. The information from [REDACTED] during her telephone call to the Medlock ward on the evening of 15th April should have led to a change in Rachel's level of observations. We consider that level 1 would have been appropriate. The failure to put Rachel on level 1 observations probably contributed to her death, as it provided her with the opportunity to end her life. The trust accepts that on the 15th April 2016 staff could have considered level 2 observations as a minimum, following Rachel's mother telephoning the ward with her concerns. The Trust also accepts that the risk assessment documentation should have been updated to include the new information provided by Rachel's mother; the discussion which took place with Rachel and the reasons for the staff not increasing levels of observations. It is more than likely that the delay in reviewing Rachel's medication contributed to her increased hopelessness and risk of suicide.","(1) I am concerned that despite the fact that Rachel Morgan and her family made it clear to the staff at the Medlock Ward from the start of her admission that she wanted her medication to be reviewed as felt that her anti-depressant medication was not working, no steps were taken to begin the review process during the 4 days she was an inpatient before her death. I am concerned that in the knowledge that Rachel was reporting issues with her medication, a medication summary could have been undertaken before the first ward round took place on 15 April 2016. Please consider whether on admission patients should have a medication summary completed as part of the clerking process, which would allow any medication reviews to be conducted by an appropriate doctor at the first available opportunity.

(2) I am concerned that on 2 occasions matters came to the attention of the nursing staff that gave them cause for concern regarding Rachel’s risk of self-harm/suicide and that neither of these incidents generated a full risk assessment to be conducted. Those incidents were the incident with the Nicorette Inhalator on 14 April 2016 and the phone call from Rachel’s mother on 15 April 2016.

(3) I am concerned that on 2 occasions that observations were considered and/or reviewed were conducted, they were not reviewed by a multi-disciplinary team as per paragraph 5.4 of the GMWMHT Observation Policy 2012. Those occasions were on 12 April 2016 and 15 April 2016 (evening). Please consider further training of all members of staff in relation to the need to engage in a specific risk assessment review process with a multi-disciplinary forum following incidents that raise issues in relation to suicide and self-harm.

(4) I am concerned that there is a lack of clarity around the different levels of observations contained within the GMWMHT Observation Policy 2012. In particular, I draw your attention to the conclusions of the SIR section 7 paragraph 8 in which the authors state that “the review team recommend that consideration is to be given by Integrated Governance as to whether there needs to be a statement added to the policy to indicate that intermittent observations can be used for an assessed risk (that is not imminent) or whether the policy provides sufficient clarity in this respect.”

(5) As the Serious Incident Review highlighted, I am also concerned that staff at the Medlock Ward placed an over-reliance on the fact that Rachel was an inpatient as being a protective factor. The evidence I have heard confirms the findings of the SIR that during her time on the Medlock Ward Rachel’s feelings of hopelessness and constant thoughts of self-harm did not reduce during her time and although her means for ending her own life were reduced, they were not entirely removed. There was evidence available to nursing staff that could indicate that Rachel was still thinking about ending her life whilst an inpatient and was considering the means that would allow her to do so. The jury have found that this was not adequately addressed by implementing enhanced observations.",False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

Harding,Kent Mid and Medway,Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust,"On 27 April 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Natalie Gray, 24 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 November 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide contributed to by neglect where there were gross failures resulting from: 1. Insufficient risk assessments on 17, 20 and 21 April 2015 to highlight the risk of self harm 2. Inadequate MDT and nursing handovers on 21 April 2015 including omission of the requirement to reassess Natalie’s informal status should her presentation change or should she attempt to self discharge 3. Failure to convey and enforce the correct procedures for informal patient leave to OT support workers 4. Failure by OT support workers to follow the leave procedure The following failures were found to have possibly contributed to the death: 1. A delay by staff at Priority House on confirming that it was Natalie who left Priority House and commencing a search 2. An unnecessary delay in the deputy ward manager reporting that Natalie was missing to Kent Police 3. A failure by the deputy ward manager to provide Kent Police with relevant information 4. A failure by the deputy ward manager to follow Trust policy by not contacting Natalie’s next of kin The following matters were found to be relevant to the circumstances of the death; 1. A failure by the Mental Health Trust to record third party information on 17 and 21 April 2015 2. By a majority of 9:2 a failure by the call taker and back up dispatch officer to elicit relevant information from the informant","Natalie Gray was 24 years of age at the time of her death. On 21 April 2015 she left Priority House where she was an informal patient and made her way to Barming railway station where she remained on the station platform for two hours until a non-stopping train approached at which point she jumped in front of it causing multiple injuries from which she died. Natalie was diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder and had a number of previous admissions to mental health hospitals following attempts to take her life. Although her mental illness was longstanding, in 2015 Natalie’s father was gravely ill, her daughter was removed from her care as Natalie was subject of a police investigation and her relationship with her partner with whom her daughter was living, ended. These individuals were all major protective features in Natalie’s life. Natalie had attempted to kill herself within a very short period of being discharged or self-discharging from hospital during the course of these events. On 9 April 2015 she was admitted as an informal patient to Priority House after attempting to gas herself. On 15 April 2015 she attended the funeral of her father and the following day was repeatedly heard to express quasi-psychotic thoughts and statements that she wanted to end her life. On 17 April 2015 she left the facility and travelled to Maidstone Hospital where she expressed the same thoughts to a hospital chaplain. The chaplain reported the visit to staff at Priority House who failed to record the matter. Natalie was seen on a ward round after returning to the facility at which time she was told that her discharge was being planned. Although Natalie acknowledged that she had a good relationship with her care coordinator and was willing to engage with psychological therapy which had been planned for her some months before and was awaiting funding, it was evident that she was distressed about the proposed discharge and felt let down. She continued to express quasi psychotic thoughts. On the evening of 20 April 2015 Natalie was found to be very agitated and demanded to see a doctor as she wanted to discharge herself having learned that her discharge was imminent. She told a psychiatrist that she wanted to leave before she was kicked out, that she felt abandoned as a result of her daughter being taken away from her, her partner not wanting to know and her father having died, she was a burden and couldn’t see a way forward but wanted to go home to die. As with previous occasions Natalie gradually calmed down. The psychiatrist recorded that Natalie’s informal status should be reassessed if she further became agitated and wanted to leave the facility. A short while later Natalie became agitated again asking to leave and stating she didn’t want to live anymore. On this occasion she accepted medication and her observations were increased. She appeared settled throughout the night and the following morning. Shortly after 15.00 on 21 April 2015 Natalie was heard to be shouting and screaming in the ward corridor. She could not get into her room and was punching and kicking the door. After being let into her room by a nurse Natalie continued to be agitated. It was established that she wanted to speak to social services to arrange contact with her daughter. She eventually calmed down after the nurse spent some 20 minutes talking to her. Natalie’s aunt had telephoned the facility around this time as she was concerned for Natalie following a communication from her the previous evening. She was told that Natalie was fine. The telephone contact was not recorded The nurse returned to her office leaving Natalie in her room and some 10 to 15 minutes later saw an OT support worker letting Natalie off the ward. It was another 5 to 8 minutes before the nurse went to make enquiries with the OT support worker as she was on the telephone with the relatives of another patient. The OT support worker was not aware that an informal patient had to be signed out by a nurse. It had become common practice for OT support workers to let informal patients off the ward to smoke in contravention of Trust policy. As a result of insufficient and inaccurately recorded risk assessments and inadequate nursing and MDT handovers none of the staff working on 21 April 2015 save the deputy ward manager were aware that Natalie was a medium risk of self-harm which became high if she left the ward, nor were they aware that her informal status should have been reassessed in the circumstances under which she left the hospital. Once it had been established that it was Natalie who left the facility a local search was conducted by two members of staff but that Natalie was missing was not reported to the police for some 30 to 40 minutes. When the police were contacted by the deputy ward manager he did not adequately convey relevant information about Natalie or her risk of self-harm and the call takers from Kent Police did not seek to elicit relevant information which would have assisted in the classification of the call and the police response.","Whilst it is recognised that a significant number of changes have been made by both the Mental Health Trust and Kent Police to procedures and protocols that were in place at the time of the death of Natalie Gray, a number of matters remain outstanding, are subject of continuing work or require clarification and as a result the following matters are of concern:

(1) The approach to discharge planning has been addressed on a general basis but the pathway for those with a diagnosis of personality disorder is currently under review and has not been finalised. It remains a concern that a patient with an emotionally unstable personality disorder will meet the current criteria for discharge but shortly thereafter be at risk particularly where specialist therapies are planned but have not been approved/started.

(2) The risk assessment form has not yet been addressed and is under review, there remains an issue as to whether the risk is recorded as a present risk alone or includes chronic risk (particularly for those with personality disorders) as opposed to historic risk. Although risk is discussed at handovers and ward rounds there is no evidence that the risk rating is communicated or signed off by the doctor when the record is completed by a nurse/junior doctor.

(3) Kent Police and Kent & Medway NHS & Social Care Partnership Trust have agreed a Missing Person Procedure implemented 1.12.2015. There is a concern about the terminology for use in the risk assessment that the Mental Health Trust is required to complete which may lead to inaccurate risk assessments. There appears to be no explanation as to whether the risk is that formally documented or the risk at the time the patient left the facility which may be less clear. Additionally the use of the term ‘significant’ is highly subjective, it is intended to mean a likely risk of self harm or something more. It is not clear how the Trust should deal with those likely to place themselves in danger and therefore at medium risk of self harm, in terms of the timescales involved and whether 999 should be used or not. By way of example, Natalie’s documented risk was inaccurately recorded as low, when it should have been medium and on leaving the facility medium to high, this could lead to an underestimation of the risk of self harm depending on how the form is interpreted by staff.

(4) Significant information from third parties was not recorded in the Rio notes when received or at all.",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

On 28 December 2015 there were no indicators that Simon was at risk of suicide. The prison and healthcare authorities did not appear to be aware of a suicide risk for Simon.

Persaud,London East,"John Brouder, Chief Executive, North East London Foundation NHS Trust","On the 27 January 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Daniel Usher. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 29 November 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion:

Mr Usher took his own life. This was in part because the risk of his doing so was not fully and carefully assessed and appropriate precautions were not taken to prevent him doing so.","Mr Usher was a 39 year old gentleman. From January 2015 he had presented to his GP on a number of occasions complaining of symptoms of depression. In the very early hours of 28 December 2015, Mr Usher sent a text to his brother which indicated possible suicidal intentions. At around 01:37 he was seen entering the grounds of the Bower Park Academy school. Police were called and found him with a deliberately sharpened twig held to his neck. Mr Usher also climbed up a tree in the presence of the police officers. They noted that a laptop and a belt were already in the tree. The belt was tied to a branch of the tree and in the presence of the officers Mr Usher tied the other end of the belt around his neck and threatened to jump. Mr Usher explained that he had just received some upsetting news about his relationship. He also admitted to drinking whisky and taking cocaine that evening. The officers were able to talk Mr Usher down and he had to be tasered for his own safety. He was detained by the police under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act and taken into the Section 136 suite at Goodmayes Hospital. Mr Usher was taken to hospital at 02:56. The duty doctor and ACAT member were informed. The ACAT member set about checking records for prior psychiatric contact. Information was gathered from a previous attendance within another Trust under Section 136 in February 2015. A Section 136 assessment took place by a junior doctor and the duty nursing officer. A decision was made to discharge Mr Usher from Section 136 at 04:50. He left the hospital at 05:00 on 28 December 2015. From the evidence available at the inquest it is likely that Mr Usher returned to the Bower Park Academy school on 29 December 2015 and hung himself from a branch of a tree in the school grounds. His body was not located until 21 January 2016.","1. The assessing team did not carry out a detailed assessment of Mr Usher, to include not only a personal assessment but also to obtain relevant clinical information from both professional and non-professional sources. This would have included information from the family and GP. There was also relevant information available to the paramedics and police that was not elicited by the assessing team.

2. The Trust policy requires that the assessment should be carried out by the duty doctor and member of the Home Treatment Team. The policy also requires that the doctor must inform the on-call doctor of the arrival and discuss the outcome of the assessment with them. The Home Treatment Team member was not present during the course of the assessment. He was gathering relevant clinical information from a previous Section 136 attendance. The information appears to have been requested shortly after 03:00 and not received until around 04:47. This was partly due to safe haven procedures which had to be complied with, before a fax could be sent. The Home Treatment Team member attended as the assessment was wrapping up. The on-call doctor was not informed of Mr Usher.

3. The Trust policy requires that an AMHP (Approved Mental Health Professional) be notified of the planned assessment. This also did not take place.

4. The police had received contact from family members whilst they were present at the hospital, confirming the concerns of family members due to the text received. This was not passed on to the hospital staff. It became apparent during the course of the inquest that the police also had access to information which was relevant to the circumstances of the preceding events which would have been relevant to the mental state of the deceased. It would appear that inadequate questions were asked by the receiving hospital team in relation to the circumstances leading to admission.

5. The junior doctor gave evidence to confirm that he was the only doctor available for 11 wards and 200 patients. It would appear from information provided by the Trust, that the number of Section 136 assessments is increasing substantially and therefore there is a concern in relation to adequate medical staffing.

6. The evidence during the course of the inquest and the evidence received from the independent psychiatrist raised a number of concerns in relation to the quality of the overall assessment and risk assessment carried out by the duty doctor. No issues relating to the medical input were identified in the Trust’s own Root Cause Analysis. Further concern was raised during the course of the inquest by the apparent lack of insight by the duty doctor and by the apparent inability to reflect on practice.

7. It is unclear from the evidence heard during the course of the inquest whether there is any audit of clinical decision making during Section 136 assessments.

8. The Section 136 policy contains a 6 hour target for assessments to be completed. Section 136 itself allows a period of up to 72 hours. It is unclear from the evidence as to whether the 6 hour limit places undue pressure upon staff to carry out assessments without gathering all of the available relevant evidence.

9. There were inefficiencies in practice which resulted in the member of the Home Treatment Team missing the 136 assessment. He had to wait for approximately 1 hour 45 minutes for clinical information to be provided. He had to go through safe haven procedures and to wait for a fax. An email to a secure email address may have avoided these delays.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 November 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide by hanging.","Mr Atkinson contacted the Mental Health Team in July 2014 in crisis. Thereafter he received regular input from the psychiatric services until the time of his death. Input was provided by the Home Treatment Team, the Community Intensive Therapies Team and a brief period as an in-patient. A thread running throughout the treatment was a lack of effective communication between staff members and indeed with the family in terms of progression of Mr Atkinson's illness which had been diagnosed as depression and anxiety with psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, there were key events of significant self-harm attempts which were not escalated by the care co-ordinator. Finally, when the care co-ordinator left, there were no measures in place to provide Mr Atkinson with an alternative care co-ordinator or indeed to even inform him or his family that the care co-ordinator was no longer with the Trust. At the time of Mr Atkinson's final assessment by the psychiatrist six days before he passed away, a discussion with the family was lacking in detail and information and furthermore though the view taken was that there was an indication to involve the Home Treatment Team, due to a change in emphasis and seemingly an increasingly high threshold, accessing the Home Treatment Team had become extremely challenging and thus the referral was not made.","(1) Lack of updated risk assessments when key events occurred or there was a significant deterioration in presentation.
(2) Failure of the care co-ordinator to identify changes in presentation and level of risk and to seek a doctor's input.
(3) Absence of an effective and robust system to identify and then manage patients under the care of departing staff (for example care co-ordinator).
(4) Lack of effective communication between mental health professionals at differing levels and also between those professionals and the patient and the patient's family.

Carlyon,Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly,"Mr Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State for Health; The Chief Executive, NHS England","David Knight died on 23 May 2015 and an inquest was opened on 4 June 2015. The inquest was held with a jury between 14 – 17 June 2016 at Truro Municipal Buildings, Truro where they concluded the death was due to suicide.","David Knight was detained under S3 of the Mental Health Act on 1 April 2015 due to deterioration in his chronic mental health issues (paranoid schizophrenia) which was exacerbated by non-compliance with prescribed medication and cannabis use. As there were no acute mental health beds available in Cornwall at that time, he was transferred to Cygnet Hospital, Keystowe, Weston-super-Mare for treatment (5 hours travel from his home in Cornwall). On 21 May 2015 he was granted S17 leave to his parents’ home in St Austell, Cornwall. He was picked up by his father from hospital on 21 May and taken to his house and appeared uncommunicative and his mental health appeared to deteriorate while on leave. On 23 May he disappeared sometime after 11.00 am from his parents’ address. At around 12.58 pm he was seen to walk and stand on the train track in front of an oncoming train on the Trenance Viaduct, St Austell. Despite the use of the emergency brakes, the train was unable to stop and it hit Mr Knight resulting in his death from multiple injuries.","At the inquest, evidence was given by the Cornwall Partnership Trust and Kernow Clinical Commissioning Group and the expert psychiatrist that there was a national shortage of acute mental health beds necessitating the use of out of county placements for patients requiring hospitalisation for their mental health treatment. In Cornwall in 2015, the average out of placement was 6/7 patients per day but on occasions up to 20 patients. In the summer of 2015, there were between 30-40 patients per day placed out of county (due in part to renovation works on a local mental health hospital).

S17 leave is prescribed by the responsible medical officer as part of the treatment to the hospitalised patient in order to facilitate them re-integrating back into the community in a structured, safe and supported way. Typically this would start off with escorted leave in the grounds of the hospital and hospital locality, moving to unescorted leave and then to home leave. Latterly the community mental health services and home treatment team are involved to ensure a smooth transition of the patient back to community living.

When Mr Knight’s mental health deteriorated whilst on leave, there were concerns that a limited risk assessment was carried out by Cygnet Hospital prior to S17 leave on 21 May 2015 and there was no communication with the local community mental health team and home treatment team in Cornwall notifying them of the leave. This meant that when Mr Knight’s mental health deteriorated while on leave, there was no method of reducing the risk of self-harm or harm to others, as no mitigation plan had been put in place in advance of the leave and the Cornwall community mental health team and the home treatment team were unaware he was on S17 leave in their area. The expert psychiatrists considered that although misjudgement about leave could occur in any hospital setting, the fact that Mr Knight was being treated out of county would have increased the risk of poor communication with the community treatment teams as the hospital would not be familiar with local service and it was very likely that this had a bearing on Mr Knight’s death ([REDACTED]).

The treatment of mental health patients generally includes the involvement of significant family, friends and pets. On Mr Knight’s previous hospital admissions, his parents and dog had been considered as significant protective factors in preventing him self-harming and also aided in his recovery. Cygnet Hospital was a 5 hour drive from Mr Knight and his parents’ home. This made it difficult to physically and practically arrange S17 leave and visiting by family/friends. There was also the cost of financing the visits. It was not possible (as on other admissions) due to the distance, for his dog to be included in the treatment plan.

At the inquest the consultant psychiatrists (including expert psychiatrist) gave evidence that it was not best practice to treat patients out of county. This was particularly relevant to patients with chronic mental health issues (as with Mr Knight) where they were well known to the local mental health service and their needs and issues had successfully been addressed in the past ([REDACTED]). Another issue raised was the difficulties of the “nearest relative” and the responsible medical officer to adequately carry out their statutory function at such distances.",False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False

Police officers and an ambulance crew attended on Mr Carroll. He agreed to a further assessment and was taken by ambulance to Airedale General Hospital. Mr Carroll was seen by a Mental Health Liaison Nurse and agreed to an assessment of his mental health. That assessment concluded with the impression that Mr Carroll was suffering from low mood. A referral was made that day for counselling and he agreed to make an appointment with his GP as the assessment from hospital together with any clinical recommendations would be sent to his GP that day. He was given contact details for the First Response Team. Mr Carroll was discharged. He attempted to see his preferred GP that day but as his preferred GP was not available he made an appointment to see the GP at 5.30pm the following day (6 May 2016). At 5.30pm on 5 May 2016, Mr Carroll was found hanging from a fallen tree by dog walkers. There were no suspicious circumstances or any suggestion of any third party involvement.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 October 2016. The conclusion of the jury was
Medical cause of death
Hanging
Conclusion – suicide and narrative
• We find that there was insufficient assessment of Matthew’s risk of self-harm and going AWOL at both the initial assessment meeting on 15 March and the ongoing assessment meeting on 16 March, due to inadequate notice being taken of information available from family and other third parties.
• We find that the level of contact received by Matthew, clinical notes and level of observation were insufficient and inadequate.
• We find no evidence of use of a sign on the door to say that it was locked and that Matthew’s ability to exit the door was a failure of the locked door policy.
• We find that patients going through the locked door into an unsecured area to smoke increased the risk that the locked door policy would fail, and we find no evidence that the Trust took all reasonable steps to reduce that risk.
• We find that the Bank Nurse did not receive adequate induction to the ward or written/oral guidance as to individual patient risks.
• We find that inadequate staffing levels was a contributory factor to failings at all stages of Matthew’s care and security.","Matthew had a history of mental health issues and these had been managed in the community and with the care of his family. He became suddenly very unwell with psychosis and following mental health assessment was detained under s2 of the Mental Health Act for his own safety and the safety of others. The following day he was able to leave the locked ward where he was detained unaccompanied. His body was discovered over an hour later, hanging by a ligature in the grounds of the hospital.","(1) The Devon Partnership Trust acknowledged in inquest that the “locked door” is still being breached on occasion, as identified on audit. An electronic pad or sign has been considered to offer clearer indications of when the door should be secured, but not yet trialled or actioned. The door therefore remains an ongoing security risk for the ward.

(2) Observations when carried out in the context of a secure mental health environment should not be predictable or entirely regular. This is not currently part of the ward policy, although it appeared to be accepted by senior staff at inquest. The Trust should consider further measures to ensure that training and instruction given to all staff in relation to observations is clear, constantly reinforced, and in line with best practice.

(3) A new system of note recording has been introduced since this death, but it still does not make obtaining information from carers and/or family mandatory on admission. The importance of this information was readily acknowledged by the Trust in their internal inquiry and at inquest. The electronic recording system should be able to facilitate capturing such information with the use of mandatory fields to avoid this oversight and could assist the Trust in achieving their stated aims in this respect.",True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

The jury determined that Amy had died from the complications arising from hypoxic ischaemic brain damage following the tying of a ligature around her neck. The jury return a narrative questionnaire in which they found that Amy’s death had been contributed to by neglect and they also found that there were a number of causative failures which led to her death. A copy of the narrative questionnaire is attached.","Amy El Keria was aged 14 years old at the material time. She had a range of complex needs associated with a number of mental health diagnoses. Up until the time of her hospital admission she lived with her mother and sister in Hounslow. Following her exclusion from school in early 2012 her mental health deteriorated and she started to ligature. In August 2012 she was seen for an emergency outpatient assessment and a planned inpatient admission was sought. However there were no specialist Child and Adolescent high dependency beds available immediately and Amy had to be admitted to the Priory Hospital at Roehampton. The following day she was transferred to the Ticehurst House Hospital which is part of the Priory Group. During her stay at Ticehurst Amy’s mental health fluctuated and at times she had to be forcefully restrained and sedated

On 12 November 2012, having told staff earlier in the day that she wanted to kill herself, she tied a ligature, namely a football scarf, around her neck and suspended herself from a radiator in her room. She subsequently died from her injuries the following day.","(1) The evidence given at the inquest showed that there was a clear misapprehension by Hounslow Social Services as to their role in supporting Amy whilst at Ticehurst. It appears that social services did not appreciate their important ongoing role to ensure Amy’s welfare whilst placed at Ticehurst. [REDACTED], the court expert, gave evidence that Hounslow may have seen this health funded placement as a stand-alone intervention that did not require their input.

(2) Social services clearly have a vital role to play in ensuring family contact where a child is placed far from their family home where difficulties arise. There was no assessment carried out to assess whether there was any need to provide support to a child in need under Section 17 Children Act 1989 even when Amy’s mother had specifically raised the difficulties she was having with contact with Amy, including the cost of travel, with her support worker.

Suicide - narrative conclusion. (Questions and answers)
1.
Were the alleged incidents of bullying adequately recorded in all required documentation on each occasion? Answer. No.
Were all appropriate persons notified to afford a proper opportunity to avoid future occurrences, such as the Acorn workshop staff?
Answer. No.
2. ACCT document.
Was this fully completed with all relevant information? Answer. No.
Did it accompany Liam on each occasion when he left the unit? Answer. No.
Did it identify the relevant issues, needs and risks and adequately plan actions to resolve or reduce these? Answer. No.
Were all appropriate individuals or organisations invited to the ACCT reviews on each occasion? Answer. No.
Was it appropriate to close the ACCT on 19 March 2015? Answer. No.
3.
Are there any other factors or circumstances outside the prison you feel to be relevant? Answer. Lack of family contact, bad relationship with his father in England, Liam's trouble with a restraining order with his girlfriend and the lack of contact with his family in Australia.
4.
Was there a delay in identifying the discovery of Liam on evening of 19 March 2015 as requiring a code blue (emergency medical) response?
Answer. Yes.
If so, did that delay possibly contribute to the outcome? Answer. Yes.
Was there a delay by prison staff in assisting paramedics to reach Liam's cell on that night? Answer. Yes.
If so, did the delay possibly contribute to the outcome? Answer. Yes.","Liam arrived in Glen Parva Young Offenders Institution at the beginning of February 2015. His anticipated release date was 1 April 2015. On 12 March he caused minor deliberate self-harm and an ACCT document was opened, noting that the reason for his self-harm was due to bullying on the wing. He was identified as being socially isolated as his family were living in Australia. He had no visits and made no telephone calls: an official visitor was planned but did not see him before he died. Liam was assaulted on 2 separate occasions by different individuals, despite being moved from the wing where the bullying had taken place, as these individuals were encountered in general areas of the prison estate. Proper consideration of the risks, the available intelligence and Liam's activities would have avoided these assaults.
The ACCT was not fully or properly completed or utilised and was closed inappropriately.
On the day Liam ligatured himself, the ACCT was closed, he later that afternoon asked for and was granted a move to a single cell. He was discovered hanging later in the evening. The emergency response of the prison officers was not according to policy, and there was a delay in assisting the ambulance crew to attend scene.","1. The ACCT document was not completed fully, did not accompany Liam around the prison as it should have and not all appropriate individuals were invited to the reviews. Available documentary information was not read or used, and pressures of time were cited to explain these failings. Consideration should be given to formally confirming that all necessary documentation has been considered prior to the ACCT review, and to ensure the officers and healthcare staff are aware of their responsibilities.

2. This ACCT was only open for a short period. It did not serve Liam's needs properly and was closed before any review system picked up the inadequacies.

3. The governor provided evidence that resourcing was affecting the ability of officers to carry out their duties regarding keeping prisoners safe from self-harm.

4528,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/michael-mcmonigle/,2016-0289,2016-08-15,C. Oliver,County Durham and Darlington,"Head Legal Services and Claims, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust","On 17 August 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Peter McMonigle, (""Michael"") born 25 October 1969. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 August 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, contributed to by neglect. The jury stated made the following entries in Boxes 3 and 4 of the Record of Inquest, including a narrative on key issues in Box 4:

Box 3:
Michael McMonigle was admitted as a voluntary patient to the Farnham Ward at Lanchester Road Hospital on 5 August 2015. Michael was able to leave the hospital unaccompanied on 11 August 2015, leading to his death on 11 in woodland at Trinity School, Trout Lane, Lanchester, Co. Durham by suspension by ligature and was declared dead at 07:35 hrs on 12 August 2015.

On the balance of probabilities the jury concluded that the admitted failure of not updating the face risk assessment, PARIS case notes and intervention plan with the assessment of risk of self-harm or suicide and the conditions for escorted leave made at a formulation meeting on 10 August 2015 probably more than minimally or trivially contributed to Michael's death.

The manner and extent that Michael's family were informed of the assessment of risk and the conditions for escorted leave following the formulation meeting on 10 August probably more than minimally or trivially contributed to Michael's death.

The manner in which the handover to his family was prepared for and conducted when Michael left the ward on 11 August 2015 probably more than minimally or trivially contributed to Michael's death.

Finally, the lapse of time between Michael leaving the hospital on 11 August 2015 and when it was recognised he might be a missing patient probably more than minimally or trivially contributed to Michael's death.

Box 4:
In conclusion Michael's death was caused by suicide whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed. His death was contributed to by neglect. Due to inadequate communication of potentially significant information between Michael's family and staff members, Michael was put at significant risk on 11. Trust leave policy was not fulfilled to a satisfactory level and staff knowledge of policy, particularly from the Consultant Psychiatrist was unsatisfactory. Whilst the jury thought that the policy was adequate, the failure of staff to recognise and fulfil all aspects of the policy was severely lacking and probably more than minimally or trivially directly contributed to Michael's death.

Appendix 3 Missing Patient report completed after Michael was found to be missing the jury held to be lacking in that not all initial actions deemed vital were fulfilled. They held it evident that there were several occasions prior to 22:00 hrs where the alarm of Michael's absence could have been raised particularly from 19:20 to 21:00 hrs.

Finally the effect that business and staff pressure had on the leave and death of Michael on 11 August was a contributing factor to Michael's death of note, the lack of handover to Michael's parents on 11 by the Acting Ward Manager which did not fulfil the Trust policy best practice and was therefore insufficient.","Michael Peter McMonigle (""Michael"") was admitted between 23 June and 23 July 2015 into Lanchester Road Hospital, Farnham Ward (an acute mental health ward) as an informal patient. He was re-admitted on 5 August 2015 as an informal patient. Until 10 August 2015, formulation meeting, he was assessed as being suitable for unescorted leave. At the formulation meeting on 10 September 2015 his risk of self-harming was assessed as ""significant"" and the conclusion was that he should not have leave off the ward unescorted. The conclusion of the formulation meeting was documented in Michael's PARIS case notes. Otherwise it was conveyed to nursing ward by word of mouth at morning report out meetings and shift handovers. Such information as was conveyed to Michael's parents from the formulation meeting was by the Consultant Psychiatrist immediately afterwards in a brief informal meeting in an adjacent room. Michael had not wanted his parents to attend the formulation meeting itself. The evidence of Michael's mother was that the information was conveyed to her by being present when the Consultant Psychiatrist said to Michael that he should not ""go off the ward without your mum"". She said that the background reasoning and analysis as to risk levels were never conveyed to her. The following day, 11 August 2015, Michael left the ward with his mother. Ward staff were unable to confirm which of them had attended at the handover and let them out of the ward. The mother recalled that it was the Acting Ward Manager.
There was a policy in place, ""Policy for Leave from Hospital and Leave of Absence under Section 17 of the Mental Health Act 1983"" (policy number CLIN0025) pertaining to informal patients. The evidence of the Consultant Psychiatrist was that there was no such policy. However, his evidence was contradicted by other ward staff and indeed the production during the course of the inquest of the policy document. No formal assessment was undertaken by ward staff of Michael's condition on handover. They did confirm that he had interacted with staff during the course of the morning and appeared to be in a comparatively positive state. Michael's mother concurred that there had been no formal assessment at the handover, further that she did not receive a briefing as to his heightened state of risk identified at the previous day's formulation meeting, or the reasons for leave to be accompanied. After a period of accompanied leave off ward in the hospital cafeteria and the car park and grounds of the hospital, Michael's parents left Michael in the cafeteria of the hospital. Michael's mother gave evidence that had she known of the heightened risk and if she had been properly briefed, she would never have left Michael alone off ward. Her precise words were she would have ""stuck to him like glue"". Michael left the cafeteria and the hospital at some time after 14:30 hrs on 11 August 2015. He did not return. Ward staff did not become concerned about his whereabouts until, at the earliest, 22:00 hrs. Ward staff in their evidence agreed that it may have been available to conclude that there was a problem from 19:20 hrs which was the evening shift handover time, and thereafter at 21:00 hrs, the normal time for returning from leave. A missing patient report states that it was from 22:00 hrs on 11 August that concern commenced as to Michael's whereabouts. Further that it was at 22:30 hrs that staff contacted Michael's parents. It was Michael's mother's evidence that they were actually contacted 23:15 hrs. The evidence from ward staff was that a search was not undertaken in the building and grounds of the available CCTV footage of the reception, entrance, car park or other grounds. Michael was reported missing to the Police at 23:55 hrs, according to the evidence of the Police Officer. Michael was found on 12 August 2015, being suspended by a ligature, the call being made to paramedics at that time. He was declared dead at the scene.","(1) The lack of knowledge of the policy for leave for informal patients amongst ward staff and the Consultant Psychiatrist in particular.
(2) The failure to follow the policy in terms of conducting an assessment prior to the handover.
(3) The failure to apply the policy in terms of ensuring that leave arrangements are clearly understood by the patient and communicated to relatives. See paragraphs 6.7 and 6.8, the policy of Leave from Hospital and Leave of Absence under Section 17 Mental Health Act 1973, policy no CLIN00025.
(4) The Face risk assessment, PARIS case notes and intervention plan were not updated with assessment of risk of self-harm and suicide and details of conditions for escorted leave following the formulation meeting on 10 August 2015. Instead, it fell to staff to verbally convey this information to colleagues who had not attended at the formulation meeting and to members of the family.
(5) Failure to respond to Michael's absence until well after 19:20 hrs, when it was admitted by ward staff in evidence that interventions could have been commenced, alternatively 21:00 hrs when it was conceded that the alarm could have been raised given that that was the normal time for return from leave.
(5) The response to Michael's absence did not conform with paragraphs 7.3 of the Missing Patients Procedure, ref. CLIN-0006-V4 in that there was no search of the hospital internally, a search of the grounds, enquiry with other staff users, check of CCTV footage.
(6) The following responses were undertaken after 19:20 and 21:00 when in conclusion of the jury the alarm could have been raised: enquiry with friends or relatives from 22:30 hrs at earliest, an attempt to telephone Michael from 22:40 hrs at earliest, contact with relatives from 22:30 hrs at the earliest (Michael's mother said 23:15), Police at 23:45 hrs at the earliest, other hospital staff at 00:15 hr on 12 August at the earliest, the medical staff at 12:20 hrs at the earliest. Staff knowledge of the Leave policy and Missing Patients Procedure was inadequate.",True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False
4534,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/thomas-gallagher/,,2016-08-11,L. Hashmi,Greater Manchester North,Chief Constable for Greater Manchester Police,"On 25 July 2016, I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Martin Gallagher.","Tom was aged 16 years at the time of his death. He had been diagnosed as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and psychosis by a child psychiatrist. In the months before his death he received care and treatment as a voluntary inpatient at a specialist adolescent mental health unit, whilst within the community he received care and support from the child and adolescent mental health team (CAMHS).

He had a history of self-harm/attempted suicide, including an attempt at self-ligature.

On 10 July 2015 Tom had been working during the day and appeared relatively settled although he struggled to control the effects of his OCD. In the late afternoon/early evening, he became agitated and therefore decided to walk the dog in order to relieve the tension. He dropped the dog back home at around 19:30 but went straight out again. When he did not return home, his family tried to contact him on his mobile – by calls and text messaging. Tom failed to respond. This was unusual.

By 21:00 his family was becoming increasingly concerned and therefore carried out a search of the local area. At 02:44 on 11 July 2015, Tom’s father contacted Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to report that his son was missing. The call taker created a Force Wide Incident Note (FWIN - 0405), completed the ‘1-12’ and coded the call as requiring a Grade 2 response which meant that the call required priority attendance, allocating by the radio operator within 20 minutes and attendance by a police officer within 1 hour from the creation of the Incident Log.

Tom was correctly identified as a missing person.

From this point on, the FWIN was delayed on no less than 14 occasions; the family’s call therefore remained unallocated. Almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without rationale. No service call was made to Tom’s family and as no officer was allocated, the ‘Golden Hour’ (important in terms of information gathering) was missed. The Incident Response Protocol - in particular the Grade 2 FWIN Escalation Process - was not followed, the cross-border process was not instigated and neither ‘Silver Command’ nor the OCB supervisor were made aware of the problems that were being encountered in allocating resources to FWIN 0405.

On the night in question, GMP was experiencing what was described as an ‘unprecedented/unpredictable spike’ in Grade 1-3 calls. There was also an ongoing policing operation within the town centre and staffing levels were low. The deployable resources available to the duty Inspector were approximately 50% lower than those ‘on paper’. Staffing levels had been persistently lower than expected in the weeks before Tom’s death.

The low staffing levels of 10-11 July 2015 were recognised in good time and were brought to the attention of the DRMU and the senior leadership team (SLT) on Monday 6 July at a routine meeting. However whilst it was agreed that additional resources would be allocated to support the Friday/Saturday shift a Chief Inspector subsequently declined to allocate/authorise this as he felt that the levels were ‘within tolerance’. This change of decision was not conveyed to the duty sergeant (who had been present at the Monday meeting) and/or divisional duty Inspector.

At around 08:00 Tom’s father made a further call to GMP as he had not heard anything. In the meantime, [REDACTED] resumed the search for her son.

At 08:07, Tom was discovered by a member of the public suspended by ligature from a tree in the park close to his home. A 999 call was made and police attended immediately. The fact of Tom’s death was confirmed by paramedics at shortly before 08:30. Tom’s mother heard of her son’s death from a member of the public whilst trying to elicit information from an officer at the scene.

Following post mortem examination the medical cause of death was given as:

1a) Asphyxia

1b) Fatal pressure on the neck

1c) Hanging

At inquest GMP admitted shortcomings in the way that it responded to the family’s call for help.

The jury concluded suicide and added the following [sic]:

- Tom’s mental health issues
- Alteration in frequency of appointments with medical services due to transitional care
- The FWIN not being switched to supervisor after 20 minutes
- Lack of contact within the initial hour to the family
- Lack of justification for the delays on the FWIN
- It could not be concluded that the admitted shortcomings caused or contributed to the deceased’s death.

The jury also found that Tom died ‘before 02:44 on 11 July 2015’.","1. The lack of formal training in relation to risk assessment and child mental health.

2. Save for the initial call handler, that all staff demonstrated intentional disregard of Force policies and protocols - including those with operational/management responsibilities and the Operational Communications Branch (OCB - see above).

3. That the Force has no set minimum staffing levels, including within divisional response and the OCB.

4. That when the persistently low staffing levels were brought to the attention of GMP’s SLT, on more than one occasion, insufficient action was taken so as to ensure that the number of officers on duty matched those identified as being required ‘on paper’.

5. That when decisions were taken not to allocate additional cover/resources:

i) no rationale was recorded,

ii) no minutes were kept in relation to the decisions taken during the Monday meeting

iii) no contemporaneous record was made by the Chief Inspector regarding his decision to reverse the earlier agreement to allocate additional resources

&,

iv) the Chief Inspector did not communicate his decision to those who needed to know.

6. Despite hearing evidence on the positive steps taken by GMP since Tom’s death, there was no solid evidence of resource commitment to prevent recurrence.

7. That there were 14 delays placed on FWIN 0405.

8. That almost all of the delays placed on the FWIN were without written rationale.

9. That FWIN 0405 went unallocated (despite some evidence of attempts to resource) resulting in the very important ‘Golden Hour’ being missed.

It was clear from the initial ‘1-12’ and the additional information recorded by the call taker within FWIN 0405 that Tom was not only vulnerable by virtue of his age but also due to the fact that he had complex mental health issues, the significance of which was arguably underestimated as a result of point 1 above.

It was accepted during the course of the evidence that the ‘1-12’ had been an initial assessment of risk only.

10. That no service call was made to Tom’s family to reassure them that they had not been forgotten.",False,True,False,True,True,False,True,True

The conclusion of the coroner was:

Mr Preston killed himself","Mr Preston had been suffering from mental health problems for a short period in the summer and autumn of 2013. On 17 October 2013 he was admitted to The Priory Hospital in Cheadle, and remained there as a voluntary patient until 11 November 2013. He was under the care of [REDACTED] In early November he was granted home leave for a few days. The leave was not successful and he returned early to the hospital. It was clear that home leave was a time of great stress to Mr Preston.

On 11 November he was discharged to his home, and into the care of the Crisis Team in his home area of Leicestershire. [REDACTED] gave evidence at the inquest that the system upon discharge was for a nurse at the Priory to speak to a nurse in the Crisis Team in Leicestershire, to send a fax to the GP indicating discharge and the medication prescribed, and it was to be followed up with a discharge letter.

There was no documentary proof of either the telephone call to the Crisis Team, of any fax, and the only document available was a discharge letter to the GP that was sent on 27 November, two weeks after discharge. The Crisis Team denied that they had received any notification, telephonic or otherwise, of Mr Preston’s discharge.

In consequence:
1. The Leicestershire Crisis Team were unaware of his discharge
2. Therefore, they did not arrange any follow up by the Crisis Team
3. After a few days at home Mr Preston became extremely anxious and depressed and [REDACTED] had to contact a mental health professional to request that he see Mr Preston, which he did immediately, and arranged a Mental Health Assessment.
4. This resulted in Mr Preston being admitted to The Bradgate Unit in Leicester on 15 November, 4 days after leaving The Priory.

In May 2014 Mr Preston hanged himself. It is not suggested that there is any causal connection between his death and the discharge arrangements from The Priory.","(1) Mr Preston had demonstrated, in his early return from home leave in the first few days of November, that living at home was a source of substantial stress, and likely to cause him severe anxiety and deepen his depression.
(2) The system for discharge of patients, whereby a nurse makes contact with (in this case) the Leicestershire Crisis Team does not appear to have been robust. There was no documentary proof of the telephone call.
(3) There was no immediate follow up by email or fax to the Crisis Team to notify the discharge, and the fact that Mr Preston was at high risk because of the anxiety created when he was living at home.

Cox,Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly,"Mr P Confue, Chief Executive Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust","On 4 November 2015, an inquest was commenced into the death of Danny Sweet. The inquest concluded at a hearing on 21 July 2016. The medical cause of death was found to be:

Ia  Fulminant hepatic failure;
Ib  Paracetamol overdose.

I returned an open conclusion. While I felt it was highly likely that Mr Sweet had taken his own life and intended to do so, I could not be sure of this.","Mr Sweet had a long history of mental health issues extending back nearly 20 years.

On 15 September 2015 he was seen in the Emergency Department at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro following a suspected overdose. He was seen by a Consultant Psychiatrist, who considered whether Mr Sweet should have a Mental Health Act assessment.

[REDACTED] concluded that there were no grounds to detain Mr Sweet compulsorily. He considered whether a voluntary admission was appropriate, but instead chose to refer Mr Sweet to the Home Treatment Team.

Mr Sweet was seen the next day by the Home Treatment Team and I heard evidence from [REDACTED] who saw Mr Sweet with a colleague.

Notwithstanding the Consultant's misgivings the day before, [REDACTED] found Mr Sweet to be much improved. He felt there was no need for involvement by the HTT and elected to refer Mr Sweet to the Community Mental Health team.

Mr Sweet was subsequently seen by [REDACTED] on 16 October, that is to say, one month after the assessment by [REDACTED]. Mr Sweet told [REDACTED] he was much improved and did not need any input from CMHT. Accordingly, [REDACTED] discharged him from the caseload.

Subsequently, Mr Sweet told an out of hours worker that he had misled [REDACTED] and that, in fact, his true condition was worse than he had led her to believe. A duty worker subsequently contacted Mr Sweet who, yet again, gave a contrary indication and said that he did not require any assistance.

On 23 October (one week after discharge from the CMHT workload) Mr Sweet took a staggered overdose of paracetamol and died the next day in Treliske hospital.","Mr Sweet presented in equivocal and contradictory fashion. Accordingly, he was very difficult to assess and it was equally difficult for clinicians to form a view of the likely risk he posed to himself.

I was concerned, however, that the very day after a Consultant Psychiatrist contemplated informal admission into hospital, a nurse from the HTT felt able to refer Mr Sweet to the Community Mental Health team where he was not seen for a month.

I wondered if it may be appropriate to reflect on how to deal with patients who present in an inconsistent manner. In particular, I questioned whether it was appropriate simply to presume the best case scenario.

I was further concerned whether or not it was appropriate for a check to be built into the assessment process to ensure consistency in treatment decisions. There appeared to be obvious inconsistencies first in the concern of [REDACTED] and the decision the very next day to discharge Mr Sweet from the caseload of the HTT and secondly, in the decision of [REDACTED] to refer to CMHT yet [REDACTED] discharging Mr Sweet from caseload after a first assessment.

Mr Sweet's case raises a more general issue namely, how the Trust deals with patients (within the confines of the law as currently drawn) who appear to have capacity and yet decline treatment/care even where family/friends state their condition is deteriorating.

I recognise this is a difficult issue. I wonder, however, whether in such situations, clinicians should record in the notes and records their concerns that patients have capacity and yet may go on to self-harm. Furthermore, I feel it may be worth reviewing if clinicians should share those concerns with family/friends who try and bring to attention the patient's deteriorating condition. I recognise there will be an obvious need to respect the rules on confidentiality.

I raise also whether there should be training to ensure that the entries in the notes and records are consistent. By way of illustration, where [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] decide to discharge Mr Sweet from their respective caseloads, they should justify those decisions in light of [REDACTED]'s earlier concern that Mr Sweet may need an informal admission into hospital.

A final matter that came out of the inquest was that the Serious Incident Report was incomplete. In particular, neither [REDACTED] nor [REDACTED] had been formally interviewed as part of the review process. You may feel that there would be merit in getting the respective clinicians from the relevant departments (Hospital Liaison, HTT and CMHT) together to see if there are any lessons to be learned.",True,True,False,True,True,True,True,True

On this occasion, the daughter was not aware of the care plan, or that she was considered to be a protective factor. Had she known, she may have been in a better position to consider if there was any evidence of relapse in her mother's mental health.

She then went to see her general practitioner, who was extremely concerned and arranged for immediate referral to the mental health services. Ms Morris was admitted to Larch Lodge, where she was treated as an informal patient. She was given weekend leave in mid July and again on Sunday, 19 July, the day before she died.","1. Brenda Morris was allowed weekend leave on the basis that her partner was at home to keep an eye on her, but no member of staff told him this. This was not a situation where she needed 24 hour supervision. Nevertheless, it would have been helpful for him to know the basis for the leave, because he would then have modified his own behaviour accordingly.

2. The weekend before the weekend of her death, Ms Morris’s partner felt that she had not been well during the weekend leave. I appreciate that care must be taken not to override a patient’s autonomy, but it might be useful for staff routinely to consider whether they are able to obtain feedback from family members after such leave.

3. There appears to be confusion about whether a doctor is needed to authorise unplanned leave of an informal patient (not relevant in this case because the leave had already been authorised). Your serious incident review of this matter indicates that this is necessary, but I heard evidence that such medical authorisation is not routinely sought.

4. Substandard documentation in the nursing records had already been identified before the inquest by your serious incident review.

Bussey-Jones,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove",The Chief Executive; Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,"On 23 November 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joanne Michelle French (otherwise known as Joanne Michelle Hay), aged 38 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 December 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide and the medical cause of death was 1a) hanging. The short form conclusion of suicide was supplemented by a narrative conclusion in the following terms: “Joanne French made a serious attempt on her life on 2 December 2014 by cutting her throat. She was taken to hospital where she was treated for her injury. She was admitted voluntarily to the psychiatric ward at Meadowfield Hospital on 3 December 2014. She was discharged from that ward on 11 December 2014. There were communication errors made in the assessment and decision making process for her discharge which related to obtaining views of members of Joanne’s family and the accuracy of information recorded as being provided by the family. Had those communication errors not existed, it is likely that Joanne would not have been discharged on 11 December 2014”.","Joanne French first went to see her GP concerning depression in September 2014. Her GP prescribed anti-depressants. She had no prior history of depressive illness.

On the 2 November 2014 she suffered a form of breakdown which resulted in her family taking her to A and E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital. She was not admitted to hospital on that occasion but it did mark the start of her engagement with the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team. She was seen at home daily by that team, with slightly reduced contact towards the end of the first month.

Joanne French was seen on the 1 December 2014 by a psychiatrist with the Crisis Team, who altered her medication as she was not showing the anticipated improvement.

Without any obvious warning signs, Joanne made a significant attempt on her life on the 2 December 2014, cutting her throat and narrowly missing major arteries. She was admitted to the Royal Sussex County Hospital and then to Meadowfield Hospital. It was not necessary for a decision to be made to detain her under the Mental Health Act as Joanne agreed to voluntary admission.

Joanne French was discharged from Meadowfield Hospital on the 11 December 2014, which the psychiatrist making the decision to discharge her described as an ‘exceptional course’. The psychiatrist gave evidence to the effect that he expected the family’s views to be canvassed in the discharge assessment and that his decision on supported discharge would be influenced by the family’s views. The importance of that aspect of the assessment to the decision maker was not understood or communicated to the nurse carrying out the assessment for discharge. Although the nurse carrying out the assessment spoke over the telephone to [REDACTED] (Joanne’s husband) at some point during the assessment process, she did not specifically ask his views and the discussion was in the presence of Joanne French. The nurse conducting the assessment was unaware that the psychiatrist who would be making the discharge decision specifically wanted to know the family’s views.

The psychiatrist believed that before making the discharge decision he had spoken directly to the nurse undertaking the assessment of Joanne for suitability for discharge but that was disputed by the nurse who undertook the assessment. She denied speaking directly to him and said he was not at the ward at the time. The psychiatrist was therefore reliant on the written notes of that assessment.

The notes made of the assessment were inaccurate in that they reported views of [REDACTED] when in fact those were the views of the patient.

Joanne’s husband and twin sister were taken by surprise with the decision for her early discharge. They were not aware that the person who would make the decision as to discharge wanted their input. They had no experience of the procedure and did not understand that their views were relevant to the discharge process, the discharge being presented as a foregone decision.

[REDACTED] had made an arrangement to discuss Joanne French’s condition with the psychiatrist on the morning of 12 December 2014 but in light of her early discharge, that appointment never took place.

In the early hours of the morning on 14 December 2014 Joanne French was found by a passer-by at Southwick Recreational Ground to be hanging by a scarf attached to her neck and a climbing frame. Emergency Services were called and CPR commenced on their arrival. She was unable to be revived and was transferred to Royal Sussex County Hospital where she was formally pronounced to have died.","(1) When taking what was described as an ‘exceptional course’ in deciding to discharge the patient at an early stage, there was lack of clarity and understanding as to what the person making the decision to discharge required to be covered in the discharge assessment process.

(2) Factors that the person making the decision for early discharge required to be covered in the assessment process were not brought to the attention of the person who was to carry out that assessment.

(3) The assessment notes were not completely clear and accurate in recording the information to be provided to the person making the decision to discharge.

(4) Consent permitting, there was no process by which the unqualified family members who would be instrumental in caring for the discharged patient could input their views and/or information for those making the decision on early discharge and by which they could understand the reasons for discharge.",True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

Although action was initially taken by DSS, her case was then closed and thereafter there was a delay in taking further action to provide support to her as a professionals' meeting was not arranged in a timely fashion and she took her own life by way of an overdose four days before the scheduled meeting.","1. Although a ""safety plan"" is prepared by CAMHS at the time of discharge from hospital, there does not appear to be sufficient input to this document by DSS with the result that those caring for a young person at risk may have incomplete written information available to them to properly ensure the safety of the young person.
2. A delay in scheduling an appropriate meeting of professionals resulted in a missed opportunity to provide support and protection of a young person at risk and there was not therefore a prompt response to a crisis.
3. The decision to close the case (and then not to reopen the same) by DSS resulted in there being no further assessments conducted at a time when action should have been taken and could have resulted in additional support for the deceased and her family.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 October 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was the medical cause of death of 1a hanging and the conclusion that Emma Bray killed herself, the requisite intention for suicide not being found.","Emma Bray (""EB"") had a history of problems with mood dating back to her teens. In 2009 she received treatment for an impulsive overdose whilst under the influence of alcohol following a relationship breakdown. She had some contact with mental health services in 2011 and 2013. Towards the end of 2014 EB's mood declined. She had suffered a relationship breakup. Her mood became worse after Christmas. On 6 January 2015 EB was assessed by the Waltham Forest Access and Assessment Team Intake Team (""IT""). She gave details of her history and symptoms and told the social worker that she was on medication prescribed privately. She also told the social worker she was in the process of changing GP surgery. The social worker discussed the case with a psychiatrist in the team and a decision was made to change the anti-depressant medication from Ectitalopram to Sertraline. This recommendation was faxed to the GP. The plan concluded “Emma to be considered for a brief allocation to monitor response to medication.” A risk assessment was completed and recorded the risk of self-harm as low. The IT did not take steps to obtain EB's full medication history either from her or from her treating clinicians. No follow up telephone call or meeting was arranged. The referral to the Brief Intervention Team (""BIT"") was not made, apparently because of workload. EB's parents then had contact with the IT on 19 January 2015 by telephone when some deterioration in her condition was reported. It was recorded that she would be discussed in the Intake meeting the following day but this did not occur. EB's parents contacted the IT again on 22 January 2015 reporting that EB had no hope she would get better and was pleading with them to end her life. When asked, the parents reported no known concrete plans to self-harm. This information was not placed before the IT MDT or passed on to anyone. On 2 February 2015 EB's mother contacted the IT again. More details were obtained about EB's medication history and the social worker said that an appointment with a psychiatrist needed to be arranged. In the meantime the psychiatrist recommended that the dose of Sertraline be increased from 50mg to 100mg. On 11 February 2015 EB was seen at home by the social worker and psychiatrist. Her parents reported concerns she would kill herself. They reported that she had been researching suicide on the internet but said she was not brave enough to do it. Her risk assessment was updated and the risk of self harm was increased to moderate. The Sertraline was changed from night to morning and the psychiatrist recorded different drug therapies he wished to consider. The plan was for a doctor's appointment to review the medication ASAP, for there to be a referral to the psychology panel and for there to be a referral to BIT. The psychology panel referral was made, although the panel that was due to sit on 16 February 2015 was cancelled and EB's case was delayed to the following week. Neither the doctor's appointment nor the BIT referral were made. In the morning of 19 February 2015 EB's father emailed the social worker with a list of symptoms and concerns: “we are of course very concerned as she says she is not going to live her life much longer like this. We also have concerns about her medication as things seem to be getting worse as the increased dose gets into her system”. He emailed again at 15.08 on the same day “please call me [REDACTED] as per last message met Emma lunchtime and she is completely withdrawn and unable to interact. I know we have been needy but really must know what is happening and see Emma's health plan with dates.” These emails were not entered into EB's notes or indeed ever provided by WFAAT. On the same day EB's mother spoke to another member of the IT who spoke to the psychiatrist. He recommended an increase in the dose of Sertraline to 150mg and to introduce Quetiapine. In the early morning of 20 February 2015 EB's father emailed the social worker again informing her that EB had “gone down, down down to the nasty place.” EB's mother spoke with the social worker that morning and was told that they would have to wait for the medication to take effect. The plan recorded was for the social worker to refer to the BIT and to [REDACTED] for EET advice. On 23 February 2015 EB was discussed by the psychology panel. On the same day the social worker referred EB to the BIT. On 25 February 2015 EB hanged herself.","During the evidence I was told that a number of things had not happened that ought to have done:
(a) A proper medication history was not taken on assessment
(b) EB’s treatment and medication history were not obtained from either public or private sector providers.
(c) Had EB’s history been obtained she should have been referred to a psychiatrist following assessment, to be seen and assessed within 14 days.
(d) [REDACTED] felt that there was an underestimate of the level and complexity of EB’s condition.
(e) EB remained with the Intake team for the whole period of her contact with the service. This appears to have occurred because of a failure to make a referral rather than because of any positive decision to retain her within the team.
(f) EB should have been referred to an appropriate service, probably initially the BIT. This would have provided her with better support and regular monitoring.
(g) Even within the IT there was a failure to follow EB up. Telephone contact should have been made with her by seven days after the initial assessment.
(h) There should have been regular contact with EB thereafter, initiated by IT.
(i) Important information was provided by EB’s family about the change in her presentation, most notably on 19 January, 22 January and then from 19 February 2015 onwards. Nothing happened in response to these reports. The information should have been placed before the Intake Team MDT to discuss her care.
(j) Had the information been provided EB should have been seen by the team and, in response to the information of 19 February 2015 at the latest, had a psychiatric assessment.
(k) The emails sent by EB’s family were not placed on her notes; accordingly other members of staff looking at her care were not aware of the family’s concerns.
(l) Risks associated with the drug Sertraline do not appear to have been communicated to EB and her family. Where the drug was recommended by a psychiatrist who had not seen or assessed EB it was unclear where responsibility for advising about risk lay.

On a systemic level, the following issues are of concern:
(a) Absence of guidelines about what information must be obtained on assessment, including the medical history.
(b) Absence of guidance about where that information should be obtained from: the patient / primary sources.
(c) A lack of clarity amongst staff about when to retain patients under the IT and when to refer out of intake to other services.
(d) Lack of clarity about what contact there should be between patients and the IT.
(e) Lack of guidance about what to do when patients are not engaging directly with the IT but there is reason for concern about them.
(f) A lack of monitoring / auditing of the passage of patients through the service to see whether cases are being managed and progressed as they ought to be.
(g) An absence of guidelines giving staff timescales within which referrals should take place.
(h) A lack of appreciation of the need to create a plan with timescales for further treatment / referral to take place.
(i) A lack of clear information about the circumstances in which it is appropriate for a psychiatrist to make recommendations about the medication without a full medical history.
(j) A lack of clear information about the circumstances in which it is appropriate for a psychiatrist to make recommendations about the medication without seeing the patient in person.
(k) A lack of clarity about whose responsibility it is to communicate risks about medication to the individual when the medication is recommended by the WFAAT psychiatrist but prescribed by the GP. This was particularly the case with the Sertraline prescribed to EB, which apparently does have specific associated risks that must be warned of.
(l) The lack of apparent process or procedure to ensure that emails sent to staff directly are placed on an individual’s notes.
(m) Any proper understanding by staff of risk assessment in the context of self-harm. The risk assessment tool in use appeared very basic and not one that provided any real assistance to staff.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

At inquest it was confirmed that Barry took his own life by hanging and was found deceased on 29 May 2015 at his home address 195 New Parks Boulevard Leicester. At the time he was diagnosed as suffering from a severe mental illness.","Barry lived alone, as both his parents whom he had cared for had died. In 2014 he was admitted to the Bradgate Unit, for inpatient psychiatric care and was diagnosed as suffering from schizoaffective disorder, a severe mental illness. He was discharged home on medication with a plan for him to be kept under psychiatric review and to be seen by the community mental health team for support in the community.

There was one outpatient psychiatric review, but there was then a delay of 4 months until the next appointment. Barry did not attend this and no follow up checks, further appointments or risk considerations were undertaken by the Trust. He was not therefore seen during 2015. In evidence the court was advised that Barry had remained on the waiting list for the community mental health team, who had made no contact during the 6 months after discharge as they were dealing with higher priority cases. Contact was only made when Barry's sister raised concerns as Barry had relapsed.

Following his relapse in May 2015 Barry was assessed but communication between the teams and the family was poor and the arrangements for future contact vague.

Barry took his own life at a time unknown but after he was seen on 26 May for assessment; his body being discovered on 29 May.","1. Psychiatric follow up was planned for 2 months but an appointment was not offered for 4 months; on Barry not attending no action was taken and there was no evidence before the court that any clinical consideration of his risks was undertaken at this time.

2. Community support did not take place as planned, and the family were not even made aware that this was awaited and Barry was on the list. It was not clear what, if any, information Barry had received apart from a very brief letter of discharge that specifically did not mention the community support.

3. The expectation of the Local Authority is that appointments should take place within 28 days, but the unit is significantly under-resourced and delays are common and appear to be tolerated, and have been for some time. Earlier, timely appointments could assist in identifying and intervening with relapsing patients. This opportunity was lost.

4. Communication between the community mental health team and other stakeholders was poor, with important information that had been identified (that Barry was depressed and not compliant with his medication) not being shared with the GP, nor were the GP or psychiatric team aware that Barry was not receiving any community support.

5. Information was not made readily available for either Barry, or the family who were trying to support him, of who was involved in his care, the extent of their role and who to contact to discuss this further or in case of any deterioration or change in presentation. This made the task of the supportive sister considerably more onerous and difficult and introduced unnecessary further delays in obtaining support for Barry at a time when his mental health was deteriorating and he was in need of urgent review.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

On 8 February 2015 he was reported to be on the railway lines by a member of the public and British Transport and local police attended the scene, removed Mr Abel to a place of safety and arranged a mental health triage team to attend at the local police station to interview him. After the interview it was concluded he was allowed to go home, without criminal charge or any mental health treatment for assessment, with his father.
The following day Mr Abel was seen by members of the public to go onto the railway line at 1 level crossing, despite auditory and visual warnings that a train was coming, and to step in front of a train, where he died instantly.","1. Mr Abel had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and he was still under the care of the Mental Health services at the time he was found in the vicinity of the railway lines, expressing suicidal intention. He had missed appointments and there was a history of non-compliance with medication.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 June 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion. Mr Savo's cause of death was 1a hanging and the narrative conclusion is as follows: ""James Savo had a long-standing history of depression. Following his first period of inpatient treatment he was discharged home on 29 November 2013. At the time of his discharge insufficient weight was attached to both the timing and nature of the home treatment team's input and also to family concerns and issues. On balance this led to earlier discharge than should have been the case. Mr Savo hanged himself in woodland off Scholes Lane on 3 December 2013. Had Mr Savo not been discharged on 29 November 2013 it is unlikely that he would have died at the time he did.""","Mr Savo had a long standing history of depression. In October 2013 he had his first period of inpatient treatment. During that time there was a change in his anti-depressant, assessment on the ward and four periods of home leave, three of which were with his family the fourth period and, longest, was with a friend. There was insufficient communication with the family regarding Mr Savo's presentation and their views on home leave. The last direct Home Treatment Team involvement was some 9 days prior to discharge when there was still issues with Mr Savo's home environment, family tensions. There was a need for on-going assessment of his response to medication. He had continuing suicidal thoughts. There was noted to be improvement in the ward setting although he was not as well whilst at home. After a seven day period of leave with a friend Mr Savo returned to the ward where he was then discharged back to his home environment; a Home Treatment Team representative was not present at this meeting. Their last involvement would have been documented in the computerised records, with the last assessment being some 9 days prior to discharge. There was no evidence of communication with the family/carers at this time. Following Mr Savo's discharge there was a crisis situation 2 days later where the decision was made to continue James' treatment in the community setting (whilst he remained at home). 4 days after discharge on 3 December Mr Savo hanged himself.","(1) The systems described as being in place which should be followed to ensure effective communication between families/carers appear not to be routinely followed. As this communication is an integral part of a patient's management and future treatment plans it is essential that all staff are aware of the need for this communication, the nature of it and who has primary responsibility for ensuring that it takes place. Furthermore, there is no evidence of any effective auditing process to ensure such systems are being followed.
(2) The early discharge plan was described as a mechanism to try and ensure a seamless transition from inpatient care to community based care in appropriate cases. Whilst this is clearly a system adopted locally and currently being re-evaluated, given its significance in facilitating smooth transitions at a time which was recognised as being difficult for many patients returning to the community, consideration should be given as to whether the current guidance etc adequately incorporates the ethos and workings of the early discharge plan.

2. The team then saw a patient without waiting to obtain the triage record created by Whittington Hospital Trust staff.

3. The doctor did not ask Ms Martin about thoughts of suicide within the context of her earlier declaration that she would die that night.

4. He did not ask her about any thoughts of harming another person, regardless of the fact he was not aware that she had threatened this.

5. He did not address his mind to what had led up to the police being called for Ms Martin, nor who had called them.

6. Neither doctor nor nurse obtained a collateral history of events from a family member before concluding their interview with Ms Martin.

7. When they obtained this afterwards and then realised that Ms Martin had left the hospital, they contacted the police but did not characterise this as an emergency.

8. The crisis team did not pass on information received from Ms Martin’s sister to the psychiatry liaison team with a sufficient degree of urgency to ensure that this was taken into consideration before the interview with Ms Martin was concluded.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 6 February 2015.

The Medical Cause of Death was 1a Multiple Injuries.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Robert Paul Yarnell took his own life whilst suffering from depression.","Robert Paul Yarnell was diagnosed as suffering with depression in October 2010.

At around 1pm on 8 October 2014 Mr Yarnell drove his motor vehicle to Barton Bridge on the M60 Motorway in Greater Manchester, and was seen to alight from the vehicle, climb over the railings of the bridge and jump from the bridge to the floor below, causing injuries that resulted in his death.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. On 3 July 2014 Mr Yarnell was admitted to the Darwen Ward of the Pendleview Inpatient Mental Health Unit at the Royal Blackburn Hospital, under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 for assessment as a result of a deterioration in his mental health. During this admission Mr Yarnell was diagnosed with unspecified non-organic psychosis.

ii. Following the expiry of the assessment period, Mr Yarnell was discharged from the Unit on 31 July 2014 with a need for continuing care to be given by the Burnley and Pendle Complex Care and Treatment Team of the Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust, whose role it is to support adults with severe and enduring mental illness in the community. Mr Yarnell was allocated a care coordinator and continuing care was to be provided to him in the community.

iii. Prior to his hospital admission Mr Yarnell had been residing at his home address in Nelson, Lancashire, however upon his discharge arrangements were made for him to initially reside at his mother’s address in Urmston, Greater Manchester with a view to him returning to his home address to live with his wife, in Nelson in due course.

iv. Following his discharge on 31 July 2014 the Burnley and Pendle Complex Care and Treatment Team contacted Mr Yarnell by telephone on 1 August 2014. As Mr Yarnell had relocated to the Greater Manchester area, the Burnley and Pendle Complex Care and Treatment Team made a referral to the Trafford Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team for them to take over Mr Yarnell’s continuing care.

v. Trafford Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team completed their assessment of Mr Yarnell on 2 August 2014 and reported to the Burnley and Pendle Complex Care and Treatment Team on 4 August 2014, that Mr Yarnell did not require their support and they would not be providing any further care or treatment for him.

vi. At this time therefore, the care of Mr Yarnell remained with Burnley and Pendle Complex Care and Treatment Team and attempts were made by them to contact Mr Yarnell. Telephone calls were made to Mr Yarnell’s mother’s address on 4 August 2014, 11 August 2014 and 27 August 2014, however on each occasion no contact was made with Mr Yarnell. A letter was sent to Mr Yarnell’s mother’s address on 27 August 2014 requesting he make contact. No visits were made to his address nor was any attempt made to contact other members of his family such as his wife or sister, who had been actively involved in Mr Yarnell’s care and whose details were known to those who had treated Mr Yarnell previously prior to his discharge from hospital on 31 July 2014.

vii. Mr Yarnell made contact with the Burnley and Pendle Complex Care and Treatment Team on 15 September 2014, which was over six weeks after his last contact with them on 1 August 2014. Following this contact Mr Yarnell did engage with the Burnley and Pendle Complex Care and Treatment Team.

viii. The evidence at the inquest was that problems can occur when a service user who requires continuing treatment, moves out of the area, as due to that move they may not be provided with the continuing treatment they need. The evidence given was that the protocols regarding the transfer of a service user out of the area provided by Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust are not clear, and that the Burnley and Pendle Complex Care and Treatment Team can be left with risky situations to manage.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. Due to Mr Yarnell moving out of the area there was a significant delay in the continuing care that he received following his discharge from hospital after a section 2 admission under the Mental Health Act 1983. Although Mr Yarnell did contact the services of his own volition some time later, I have concerns that in future cases a service user who requires ongoing support and treatment from Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust, may not receive it due to residing outside the Trust area.

ii. The procedures and protocols currently in place within Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust for the continuing care of a service user, when that service user moves out of the area, are not clear and give rise to risky and potentially fatal situations.",True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False

(3) The referral process for SORT failed to materialise despite repeated concerns expressed.

(5) There was a failure to maintain a good flow of information. Most strikingly, the staff at Beaufort Road were not advised of Mr Holt's most recent attempt at self-harm (by overdose of his medication) and were thus unaware of the degree of risk when he returned to that address where support would have been available.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 January 2015. The conclusion of the inquest jury was that

(i) the medical cause of death was I (a) haemorrhage I (b) stab wound to the chest,

(ii) the deceased died as a result of her own deliberate act, whilst suffering mental ill health, but the evidence does not establish, beyond reasonable doubt, whether she intended that act to cause her death, and

(iii) her death was more than minimally contributed to by failures by the Trust (a) upon her return to the Abraham Cowley Unit on 7 December 2012 to elicit information about issues arising during her overnight leave and (b) to assess sufficiently and immediately her mental state upon her return to the Unit following her overnight leave.","Katherine Liana Bonaventura was a patient detained under the Mental Health Act in the Abraham Cowley Unit of St Peter’s Hospital, Chertsey. Katherine Bonaventura was diagnosed as suffering paranoid schizophrenia and had a significant and recent history of violent self-harm.

Her detention had commenced in October 2012 and she had undertaken her first overnight leave from the Unit from 6 December to 7 December 2012. During that overnight leave, which the deceased spent with her family, she consumed alcohol and, on the morning of 7 December, was seen to be in a psychotic state and staring at a kitchen knife block.

These facts were of relevance to the deceased’s risk of self-harm but they were not elicited from the family member who returned the deceased to the Unit. Further, the deceased’s mental state was not immediately or sufficiently assessed upon her return to the Unit.

In fact, Katherine Bonaventura returned to the Unit with a concealed knife, taken from the kitchen knife block at home, with which she fatally stabbed herself a few hours later. The evidence suggested that if the full picture had been elicited when Katherine Bonaventura returned to the Unit, her mental state may have been more thoroughly examined, she may have been searched and she may have been kept under greater and/or more regular observation.","It was clear from the evidence that the Trust had and has in place guidelines entitled “Working Age Adults Inpatient Leave of Absence Guidelines for Detained Patients” dated November 2011 and reviewed in July 2012. Those guidelines state, “Upon return from leave, an assessment of the patient should occur and the family member, carer should be consulted to ensure any issues arising during leave are noted. The outcome of this discussion should be documented in the patient’s clinical record.”

It was apparent from the evidence that (i) the consultation with the family member / carer may consist of no more than an exchange of a few words in the presence of the patient, (ii) it is sometimes difficult for a family member / carer to provide all relevant information to staff in those circumstances and (iii) if staff are not immediately aware of any issues arising, their “assessment of the patient” may consist of no more than an exchange of a few words in the reception area.

It is, therefore, of great importance that staff elicit as much information as possible about the leave and any concerns arising, at the point of the patient’s return.

It is of concern that there is no system in place to ensure that a sufficiently thorough consultation takes place with the family member / carer, which is designed to elicit as much information as possible as soon as possible. One nurse stated in evidence that it is now his personal habit to escort the family member / carer off the unit so that he can conduct a further, private, consultation, but that not all nurses do so. It is also of concern that there is no system in place to ensure that a sufficient mental state assessment of the patient is conducted, and its outcome is recorded, at the time of arrival back on the unit.",True,True,False,True,True,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 December 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was that Alex Kelly died from a hypoxic brain injury having suspended himself on 24 January 2012 from a ligature made from his shoelaces which was attached to a locker within his cell at Cookham Wood Young Offenders Institution where he was serving a sentence. He died at Medway Maritime Hospital on 25 January 2012.

The jury were unable to determine his intention in suspending himself but found that his emotional state was significantly compromised at the time.

The jury further concluded:
1. That there was a systemic failure by Tower Hamlets Social Services to allocate a named social worker which hampered communication with other agencies, the ability to address ongoing concerns about Alex's mental health issues and his continuity of care all of which led to an inadequate level of support for a vulnerable looked after child. Additionally Tower Hamlets failed to address Alex's placement on release, his wish to see his grandmother.
2. At Cookham Wood Young Offenders Institution the effective sharing and evaluation of important information was hampered by the number of different types of systems used to record information concerning Alex Kelly, a lack of communication between staff and departments and a lack of communication with external parties all of which led to a reduced ability to safeguard Alex effectively. Additionally a review of the safeguarding provisions on 24 January 2012 should have included requesting Alex to move to a supervision cell for the night and maintain constant observations and removing his laces.","Alex Kelly was a vulnerable and immature 15 year old who had suffered repeated serious sexual abuse as a very young child. He became a looked after child at the age of 6 with Tower Hamlets the Corporate Parent. He was fostered for 10 years with a family in Medway. In early adolescence Alex developed identity issues. He had variously been diagnosed with ADHD, and assessed as mildly autistic but it was common ground that his deep rooted problems had never really been addressed in the community.

Alex first became involved with the Youth Courts in 2010 and until August 2011 appeared repeatedly before the Youth Courts having offended and breached orders. On 1 August 2011 Alex was remanded to Cookham Wood YOI and was later bailed on 9 August 2011. This was his first time in custody. On 10 October 2011 he was further remanded to Cookham Wood and sentenced the following day to a 10 month DTO.

Whilst in custody Alex was diagnosed by a psychiatrist within the mental health in-reach team with ADHD and conduct disorder and was prescribed medication.

Alex initially engaged well with the regime but his behaviour began to deteriorate in December 2011 and an ACCT was opened on 23 December 2011 because of his low mood and a refusal to engage in education, activities and association. The ACCT was closed on 3 January 2012 but reopened on the 6th and remained open until his death. A Behaviour Improvement Plan designed to encourage him to engage was opened on 29 December 2011 and remained open until late January. Throughout January 2012 Alex received a number of adjudication awards for blocking the observation panel to his cell or tattooing. Awards prevented him from engaging as envisaged by the Behaviour Improvement Plan.

Alex had repeatedly made marks on his arms throughout January 2012 which were variously regarded as tattooing or self-harm.

Alex's presentation throughout the period was variable, sometimes appearing in relatively good spirits but very often refusing to engage and remaining in his cell. Alex made a number of threats to take his own life by 'stringing up' but when tasked about this issue smiled or appeared to prison staff to treat it as a joke. He progressed to writing notes to the same effect and then to making ligatures with his shoelaces.

On the evening of 24 January 2012 Alex for the first time spoke of the sexual abuse that he had suffered and indicated it was all he ever thought about. He said he wanted to kill himself and that there wasn't anything officers could do about it as there would be sufficient time between observations. A short time later he telephoned his foster carers and was seen to be upset and after started to cry but stopped himself when an officer noticed. He then told another officer who had a good relationship with him and who had been asked to speak with him because he was upset, that he was going to hang himself. He repeated this to the same officer a short time later. Officers thereafter responsible for observing Alex were not informed of these disclosures.

Alex's observations were around this time increased from 3 to 5x hour.

He was seen inside his cell drinking a hot chocolate at which time his observation panel was partially blocked. When an officer next went to check 15 minutes later there was no response and the panel was blocked. Officers entered his cell 4 minutes later to find him hanging from his shoelaces which were tied to a locker

Whilst he was at Cookham Wood YOI Alex had repeatedly stated he wanted to see his grandmother and from the beginning of January 2012 had stated that he did not want to return to his foster parents on release. At the time of his death his placement was unresolved and a number of telephone calls Alex made before he died were seeking to find a placement with people he knew","Re: Secretary of State for Justice

Alex Kelly, a vulnerable looked after child of 15 years with complex unresolved emotional issues and undiagnosed mental health issues, was sentenced to a Detention and Training Order to be served at a Young Offender’s Institution without the benefit of a forensic psychiatric assessment. Whilst I heard evidence from a psychiatrist associated with Cookham Wood YOI that the mental health in-reach team were able to address Alex’s mental health needs whilst in custody, I am aware of the deaths of a number of other children in custody who similarly had not had forensic psychiatric assessments and it is for this reason I am reporting the concern. Whilst hearing evidence in relation to lessons learned, I heard from the Service Manager of Medway Youth Offending Team that they have now secured the services of a psychiatric mental health nurse to assist them in the effective management of the young people for whom they have responsibilities, which I was told was proving effective and is to be continued.

Alex Kelly was under an ACCT between 23 December 2011 and 3 January 2012 and 6 January 2012 until his death. During the operation of the ACCT there was a continued conflict between the ACCT process and disciplinary procedures; outside agencies and carers were not asked to contribute; specific acts by Alex were seen as obstructive/challenging behaviour rather than signs of distress or a means of communicating that he needed help (his foster carers who had not been asked to contribute had some experience of Alex using non-verbal methods of communication); the ACCT reviews tended to focus on addressing specific or recent behaviours rather than the reason for the behaviour; although Alex was frequently mentioned at weekly safer regimes multidisciplinary meetings, a holistic approach was never adopted as to how he could best be supported or whether the YOI could support his needs.

Re: Tower Hamlets

1. Allocation
a) Alex Kelly was without a named social worker for a period of two months at a time when he was in danger of being sent to custody and after he was sent to custody. Difficulties in allocation were not escalated to senior management.

2. IT
a) Social workers did not transfer documentation including emails onto Framework i in a timely manner or at all.
b) There was no system in place for ensuring that urgent electronic communications were flagged/diverted when the recipient was absent from work.

3. Custody
a) Social workers did not all appear to appreciate that their responsibilities as Corporate Parent included a role in a looked after child’s welfare whilst in custody.

Re: Medway Youth Offending Team

1. Involvement with other agencies
a) Shortcomings in other agencies which affected the ability of the YOT to manage the young person were not brought to the attention of management.

2. Placement within the Secure Estate
a) There were inconsistencies in recommendations as to placement in a STC/YOI which were not reconciled.
b) Youth Offending Team keyworkers did not all appear to appreciate that their responsibilities included a role in the young person’s welfare whilst in custody.
c) Members of the Youth Offending Team did not all appear to appreciate that the Youth Offending Team could initiate a transfer within the secure estate.

3. Caseworker based at Cookham Wood YOI
a) Outside agencies sharing responsibility of the welfare of a young person in custody and foster carers were not kept informed of significant events, asked to participate in ACCT reviews or asked for input into the management of the young person.
b) Although involved in the ACCT reviews, the caseworker was unaware of the range of options available to safely manage the young person including requests to transfer to a different type of secure accommodation and the use of enhanced reviews.
c) Paperwork was not submitted for early release on the basis of non-compliance with the regime and concerns about absence of a placement without consultation with any person responsible for making decisions in relation to early release.

Re: Cookham Wood YOI

1. Communication with outside agencies
a) Outside agencies sharing responsibility of the welfare of a young person in custody and foster carers were not kept informed of significant events, asked to participate in ACCT reviews or asked for input into the management of the young person.

2. ACCT
a) Officers were inconsistent in the recording of significant events; entries being made in either the wing observation log, ACCT ongoing record or not at all.
b) At least one officer did not appear to appreciate the importance of significant incidents/disclosures or report them.
c) Significant events in a lengthy ongoing record were not highlighted and therefore not obvious to officers reviewing safeguarding provisions.
d) Officers were unaware of the need to involve outside agencies in the ACCT review process, the range of options available to them to safely manage the young person including requests to transfer to a different type of secure accommodation and the use of enhanced reviews.
e) The safer regimes meetings were not provided with all relevant information and were not used to their full effect. The minutes of the meetings were not fully recorded.
f) A holistic approach was not taken to the safe management of the young person during ACCT reviews or Safer Regimes meetings when it was apparent that he was struggling with the regime and that interventions were not working.

3. Conflict between Regimes
a) Officers did not always seek advice before placing the young person on report for tattooing when there was an indication in the ACCT documentation that adjudication awards would lead to a heightened risk of self-harm.
b) There was a conflict between the use of a behaviour improvement plan and adjudications which was not recognised at the time.

4. Early Release
a) Paperwork was not submitted for early release on the basis of non-compliance with the regime and concerns about absence of a placement without consultation with any person responsible for making decisions in relation to early release.

5. Cell entry
a) There appeared to be an inflexible approach to cell entry requiring the presence of three prison officers even though YOI was in patrol state and concerns were sufficient to require entry.

Re: Healthcare at Cookham Wood

NB: the service provider has changed since the death of Alex Kelly. The new provider is in the process of determining the systems and procedures being put in place at Cookham Wood.

1. Sharing of Information
a) Officers concerned with the management of the young person were not informed in terms of his non-compliance with medication and the potential effect of the failure to take the medication.

2. Medication management
a) Medication was found stockpiled in the young person’s cell; staff dispensing medication had not ensured it had been taken when it was probably recorded as having been taken.
b) Any failure to take medication was not sufficiently flagged for healthcare/prison staff to deal with the issue.

3. Recording of information
a) Not all occasions when the young person was seen by the in-reach team were recorded on System One.",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False

2. Mr Aitken had been admitted to Prestwich Hospital Psychiatric Hospital when he was 16 years old. When he was admitted on 10 June 2014, no consideration was given to asking for any record of that inpatient stay.

That was some 14 years earlier and may not have yielded anything useful but, as Mr Aitken was not registered with a general practitioner, it was the only source of history from healthcare professionals.

I made a determination at inquest that Ms Bodrožić took her own life, whilst suffering a schizoaffective disorder.","Sandra Bodrožić was at home with her mother when she suddenly ran up to the attic, said goodbye and jumped out of the window, landing on the ground three storeys below.

Ms Bodrožić had been detained under the Mental Health Act on 22 October 2013 and admitted to St Pancras Hospital. She was discharged on 11 February 2014 then treated in the community until her death.","1. Ms Bodrožić agreed on 23 May 2014 to the recommendation of those treating her that she be admitted to hospital on an informal basis. However, no bed was found for her until 30 May, by which time she had changed her mind.

There was no exploration of the possibility of purchasing a bed from the private sector when no NHS bed was available.

2. The consultant psychiatrist treating Ms Bodrožić formed the view on the evening of 18 June 2014 that Ms Bodrožić should have a Mental Health Act assessment. However, the psychiatrist was going on holiday the following day and so decided to leave this until her return, rather than asking colleagues.

3. The approved mental health professional (AMHP), a social worker, who visited Ms Bodrožić on Wednesday, 25 June 2014, decided that she needed a Mental Health Act assessment and immediately made the appropriate referral.

However, once the referral was made, it took until the following week for this to be arranged, and Ms Bodrožić had killed herself in the meantime, on Sunday, 29 June.

The provision for assessment is open ended, with no apparent sense of urgency, and there is no protocol for the timeframe within which this should take place, nor is a time agreed as appropriate with patient or family.

Brown,"County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay",Devon Clinical Commissioning Group; NHS England,"On 26 August 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of George Christian Werb aged 15. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 October 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative verdict: George died on 28 June 2013 on the railway track at Seaton Station, Seaton, Devon. At that time he was on home leave from inpatient care in a child psychiatric unit. Before he went on leave he was assessed as having no suicidal risk but the information used in this assessment was incomplete, inaccurate and did not reflect the actual situation. Poor engagement with the family, placing him in a unit a long distance from home, absent note keeping and inadequate internal communications all contributed to this outcome.","George Christian Werb was receiving treatment for serious mental health issues, including a probable diagnosis of psychosis and depression, and was detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act and admitted to the Priory Hospital, Southampton 23 May 2014 for treatment. This was the nearest unit available for a child with George's needs, notwithstanding this was more than a 2 hour drive away from the home address, and friend and family support. George continued to receive treatment for a number of weeks, then the Section was lifted, and periods of home leave were commenced.

The second of these periods of home leave commenced on 27 June 2014, notwithstanding that the situation had not been effectively risk assessed. Communication with the family was poor and due to the distance between the treating hospital and home address. No family therapy had been undertaken and the family had not received appropriate and full information of their son's diagnosis and the risk of suicide had not been adequately considered before leave was allowed.

George walked onto a railway track near his home the morning after his home leave commenced and died when he was hit by an express train.","(1) The community team had to spend much time making numerous telephone calls to locate a child psychiatric bed. There was not at the time, and still appears to be no, or no effective bed bureau system to identify spaces. This is wasteful of clinician time, creates inevitable delays and is indicative that there are routinely too few available beds to serve the needs of our child psychiatric patients.
(2) On a previous admission during May 2014 the bed located was in Huntercombe, and George was removed by his father as the bedroom had inadequate furniture, had no bed linen and there was concern the environment was adding to George's distress. The distance between home and this placement was in excess of 3 hours travel time.
(3) On the index admission, George was placed in the Priory Hospital, Southampton, a distance of over 2 hours travelling time from home. This is not an NHS facility and is specifically for ""overflow"" patients from all across England, many of whom are therefore huge distances from their home, their family, their friends and community support.
(4) Due to the distance, the hospital made the decision that family therapy could not take place (although the parents would have engaged if the importance of this was explained) and periods of home leave were extended due to travelling times, rather than in response to clinical need.
(5) There was poor attendance at the CPA meeting, and both parents and the community team only ""attended"" by telephone, which was far from ideal and impacted on the effectiveness of communication between all parties.
(6) Having local accessibility where in patient care is required was recognised in the Mental Health Crisis Care Concordat published 18 February 2014 to be important to keep the young person close to home, school and friends and this was also recognised by all the clinicians at inquest to be important and necessary. With current provision of beds this need is not being met, and is impacting on patient care.

She had been an inpatient on the Sheridan Ward in January 2014 until her discharge on 7 February 2014. On 26 February she then re-presented having taken an overdose and was then transferred to the Grasmere Unit at Whiston Hospital due to a shortage of beds. She remained an inpatient and was transferred back to the Sheridan Ward on 9 April. A week later on 17 April 2014 she was discharged home under the care of the Home Treatment and Recovery Teams.

On 1 May 2014 the deceased was found having taken her own life at her mother’s home.","- It was clear from the evidence that the deceased required psychological input. The inquest heard evidence that whilst she was an inpatient on the Grasmere Unit there was no inpatient psychological input available due to maternity leave which had not been covered.
- There was confusion in the evidence as to whether, whilst an inpatient on Grasmere, a referral had been made to outpatient psychological services (i.e. the Recovery Team services). This resulted in a referral being made by her care co-ordinator on 24 April when she had already been discharged home. This confusion meant that there was either a delay in any referral being made or at best a duplication of her referral.
- On 17 April there was a meeting which ultimately led to the discharge of the deceased from hospital. The care co-ordinator had already expressed that she would not be available due to annual leave but had left details of her colleague who would attend if this was a discharge planning meeting. No-one from the Recovery Team attended this meeting. They were the prime carers for the deceased on her discharge and had the role of care co-ordinator.
- On 28 April, the deceased’s family contacted the Home Treatment Team out of hours numbers available to them as they had concerns about the deceased being in the house on her own the following day as she was having suicidal thoughts. Their understanding of the request was that someone from the Recovery Team would visit her the following day.

Please find attached a copy of the Record of Inquest.","Stephen had in fact been born at his home address; [REDACTED] and was the sole carer of his mother, retiring from his employment as a lorry driver some time previously. In January 2014 his mother was admitted to hospital and Stephen was taken by his family to the Accident & Emergency Department at the Lister Hospital where he was found to be malnourished and reported hearing a noise in his head. He was assessed both physically and mentally and was felt to be objectively and subjectively depressed. He was prescribed mirtazapine and to be seen by his doctor and for his family members to oversee his mother’s care. Stephen was seen by his General Practitioner Dr Turner and saw him subsequently on 16 January 2014 where he self reported as being very much better and well supported by his family and that the responsibility of caring for his 88yr old mother had been too much for him. There had been no previous reports of self-harm and he denied any ideation or intention of self-harm. Stephen’s blood pressure was normal and it was the general opinion of all that he was making good progress. A multi-disciplinary case conference had taken place at the Lister Hospital at which it was concluded that it was in [REDACTED] best interest to be cared for by residential assessment initially for respite. However the Social Worker reported subsequently that when [REDACTED] was seen on her own that she very much expressed the wish and desire to return home and to the Social Worker on her own expressed the view that she was not happy about going into residential care notwithstanding that it appeared that she had accepted going into residential care when seen with the family. The assessment of the Social Worker was that [REDACTED] had capacity and therefore the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act and Deprivation of Liberty was not applicable. [REDACTED] and her son had never requested a full package of care but the Team Manager felt that [REDACTED] should be returned home with a full package of care to support [REDACTED] in her perceived wish to be at home and to support her carer, Stephen. This decision was communicated to Stephen by telephone and shortly afterwards he took his own life. His body was discovered some two days after contact had been made.","To try and ensure that appropriate consents are always given from service users to enable those responsible for providing care to have full information to ensure the most appropriate care is provided. i.e. it would have been helpful for the Adult Care Team to have had Mr Amer’s consent for them to have received the information from his General Practitioner and also the Hertfordshire University Partnership NHS Trust as to their assessment carried out at the Lister Hospital.

If as in this case there is a change of plan that the full details of the plan should at least be in embryo form before the change of plan is given to the relevant person, in particular the carer.

The manner of communication should be considered carefully. I would suspect that a face to face communication if possible would be more appropriate as it gives the ability for questions to be answered and full explanations given. It also enables those informing the decision to be able to gauge the reaction of the recipient of that information.

A variety of investigations were initiated, with no significant pathology being elucidated.
He again consulted [REDACTED] on 12 March 2014 complaining of feeling more tired and with low mood. Feelings of hopelessness and self-harm were elucidated. A PHQ-9 screening test was administered with a score of 16/27 being obtained, indicative of moderately severe depression. Mr Thorpe was given a prescription for 20 milligrams of the anti-depressant fluoxetine daily and asked to self-refer himself to ""IAPT"" (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies). He was given no firm appointment to be seen again at the practice, but the plan noted in the clinical records was to see him again in 1 months time.
On 24 March 2014, Mr Thorpe left his home, taking his dogs for a walk. His dogs were found tethered to a railing adjacent to the Forty Foot Drain, a large drainage dyke, at Swineshead Bridge. Footprints, matching his boots were found tracking down into the dyke and he was found floating in the middle of the dyke.
The post mortem indicated that the cause of death was drowning and that he had been taking fluoxetine regularly in the days before his death as well as diphenhydramine.","1 That the deceased was asked to ""self-refer"" himself to IAPT rather than a direct referral being made on his behalf to an appropriate mental health resource.

They therefore did not receive information that might have alerted them to periods when he was particularly vulnerable and when they might have had information that would have been of assistance to the Team in caring for Mr Brown.
(2) The evidence also demonstrated that it was not the practice of the Team to show family members what notes had been made by the Team of information shared with them by family members, with the consequence that inaccuracies or misunderstandings may have arisen in some notes, and there was no provision for those notes to be signed as accurate by the relevant family members.
(3) The family members were not made aware of ways in which they could obtain through the Kent and Medway NHS Social Care and Partnership Trust (of which the Team was a part) more information about how they might best support Mr Brown and themselves receive support.
(4) In general, the evidence showed limitations on the possibilities for engagement by the Team with family members and by family members with the Team, particularly when Mr Brown did not wish information about him to be shared and this worked to his disadvantage. There was, however, evidence of some improvement having already been made by the Trust in this respect. When engagement was possible, the absence of a system whereby a person giving information to the Team would check that that information had been correctly noted and interpreted by the Team posed obvious risks for anyone under the care of the Team.",True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False

Prison Swansea","On 21 June 2012 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Thomas Purser aged 29. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 February 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion. The cause of death as given by the pathologist was:

1a) Hanging

A summary of the narrative conclusion of the jury is that the deceased took his own life by hanging himself on 13 June 2012 at H.M. Prison Swansea.

The deceased intended to take his own life due to contributory factors of severe depression and relationship breakdown.

ACCT reviews should have taken place after incidents at noon and 4 pm on 13 June 2012 and the sharing of information between prison staff by way of recording significant interactions in the ongoing record of the ACCT plan were inadequate. However, these matters were not considered to have more than minimally contributed to the deceased's death.","Matthew Purser hanged himself in his cell at Swansea Prison about 19:25 on 13 June 2012. He had been on remand from 9 June 2012 and was in the drug recovery wing because of his substance misuse. He was receiving medication for alcohol withdrawal and had been placed on an ACCT (self harm monitoring document) from the time of his initial assessment by a nurse on arrival at the prison. At this initial assessment Mr. Purser referred to recent bereavement, attempted self harm about three weeks before and very high alcohol intake. He stated he was hearing voices and that he had an appointment later that month in the community with a psychiatrist. He was given anti withdrawal medication and a referral was made by the nurse to the in-reach mental health team i.e. the Local Health Board ran secondary mental health service working in the prison.

Under the ACCT observations were set at two hourly in the day, with three meaningful conversations to be conducted.

On the following day a second health screen was carried out involving seeing the prison GP and a mental health nurse on two occasions. Mr. Purser was booked into the “lighthouse clinic” (primary care prison mental health service). On the same day the deceased underwent his ACCT assessment and first ACCT review. The triggers for further review were recorded as “loss of contact with partner/breakdown in relationship”. During the assessment interview for the ACCT the deceased had shown himself to be very dependent on being able to speak to his partner and the prison tried to facilitate this contact with one of the officers ringing the partner on that day to give her information about visiting and after which the deceased was said to be much improved in mood.

Mr. Purser continued to have telephone contact with his partner on 11 and 12 June but on 13 June in a telephone call to her shortly before midday he was seen by officers to become visibly upset and was noticed punching the metal hood over the telephone. An officer who witnessed this took Mr. Purser to an interview room to calm him down. An entry was made at midday on the ACCT that Mr. Purser had stated his girlfriend had had a miscarriage and wanted to leave him. The officer said that he would see Mr. Purser after the lunch break and at 14:30 he took him to a staffroom and rang the partner on behalf of Mr. Purser, saying that Mr. Purser was sorry to put pressure on her and that Mr. Purser would not telephone her again for 24 hours as the calls were upsetting them both. After this Mr. Purser seemed more settled. No entry was made in the ACCT concerning the interaction of the officer and Mr. Purser after lunch. Despite the agreement which the officer had reached between Mr. Purser and his partner Mr. Purser telephoned her again at about 15:50. The same officers saw Mr. Purser on the telephone and when challenged he said he was calling his mother but one of the officers asked control to check the number called and was told it was the partner. An ACCT entry was made at 16:00 stating that Mr. Purser was a manipulative individual, willing to say anything to get his own way, but the officer who had made the agreement with the partner did not challenge him about his behaviour and decided to leave speaking to him until the next day.

After 18:00 there were two further telephone calls between Mr. Purser and his partner in which they argued and he threatened to hang himself. These were not observed by officers. At about 18:35 Mr. Purser asked to go back into his cell to use the toilet. The officer who allowed this had no concerns about his demeanour although his cell mate said he was very upset. At about 19:25 the same officer noticed the observation hatch covered and on investigating found Mr. Purser hanging. This was about twenty five minutes after he was last observed.","1. The doctor who saw Mr. Purser for the second health screen on the day after admission had not received ACCT training as required by PS1 64/2011 and HMP Swansea Suicide Prevention Policy 2010 and was not aware of the requirement for him to be trained in the procedures although he was aware of the procedures.

2. The trigger event endorsed on the documentation requiring review of Mr. Purser under the ACCT was given as “loss of contact with partner/breakdown in relationship”. Mr. Purser’s apparent dependence on maintaining contact with his partner was correctly identified by the prison but the way in which the wording of the trigger was expressed left much to the subjective assessment of the officers about the state of his relationship with his partner. Because of the way in which the ACCT records were kept officers did not have enough information to make a realistic assessment and in their evidence some officers draw a distinction between Mr. Purser’s relationship going through a difficult time and it having broken down. If a trigger event is something which cannot be easily and objectively determined by an officer more detailed observations and recording will be required. If the only way in which a trigger can be expressed is in similar language to this case some indication needs to be given as to how the assessment is to be carried out and how clearly information must be shared by means of the records kept.

3. The prison appreciated that Mr. Purser was due to have a psychiatrist’s appointment in the community soon after coming into prison. Although he was booked into the primary care prison mental health service the means by which community health records were to be obtained was not clear. For an appropriate assessment to be made there is a need for an urgent contact with community mental health services to be made so that records are promptly obtained.",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

Harding,Kent Mid and Medway,Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust; Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust,On 27 August 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Franklin dob 14.09.1945. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 and 30 April 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was that Peter Franklin killed himself whilst suffering from depression. The medical cause of death was multiple injuries,"Peter Franklin suffered with mental health difficulties for many years. He had previously been admitted to hospital following an overdose in 6/2013. Following his discharge from hospital in 7/2013, Peter Franklin attended Accident and Emergency Departments with increasing frequency in the period leading up to his death. On 19/8/2013 he attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Maidstone Hospital on four occasions and Priority House (mental health team) on two occasions. His behaviour was increasingly unusual throughout the day but he did not present as a suicide risk when seen by his care co-ordinator in the morning. The mental health team was informed of the circumstances of his attendances at Accident and Emergency. On the evening of 19/8/2013, when he attended Accident and Emergency on the fourth occasion, he attempted to jump from a motorway bridge at Junction 5 on the M20 after discharge from the hospital and was prevented from doing so by the taxi driver who was returning him home. Peter Franklin was taken back to hospital where a request for a mental health assessment was made to the CRISIS team. An assessment did not take place although one was required because the psychiatric nurse did not think it fair to make Peter Franklin wait at the hospital until she was able to attend. The psychiatric nurse told the hospital nurse to call his daughter to take him home. She did not inform the nurse that Mr. Franklin may be a suicide risk or that an assessment was required but would entail him waiting at the hospital. Peter Franklin was dropped off at his home address by his daughter who was unaware of the detail of that which had transpired. Within approximately ten minutes of leaving him at his home address Peter Franklin drove to the motorway bridge that he had earlier attended and jumped to his death.","(1) There was confusion in the terminology used between nursing staff or doctors and the CRISIS team when out of hours calls were made such that it was not clear between parties whether a referral, advice or assessment was sought

(2) Relevant information/advice was not provided by the CRISIS team to parties who had made referrals

(3) Mr Franklin’s GP would have initiated a multidisciplinary team meeting to address the increasing frequency of attendances at hospital had he been aware of the recent hospital admission, the subsequent involvement with the mental health team and the attendances at A&E. The documentation from both hospital and mental health trusts was subject of significant delays such that none of the letters to the GP sent by either trust from July onward arrived with the GP before Mr Franklin died",False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False

Wilcox,London Inner West,"Head of Mental Health Commissioning, NHS England, Surrey and Sussex Area Business Team; Mr Ken Wilson, Chief Executive Officer, Cygnet Health Care; Mr Bob Deans, Chief Executive, Kent and Medway Mental Health Directorate","On 17 April 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lisa Marie Inkin aged 21 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 January 2014.

The conclusions of the inquest were as follows:

Injury or disease causing death:
I(a) Multiple trauma

How, when and where Ms Inkin came by her death:

Lisa suffered with severe anorexia nervosa and at the time of her death was on home leave from Cygnet Eating Disorders Unit in Ealing. On 9/4/2013, instead of returning to the ward as planned to attend a CPA meeting, she dived in front of a train at Victoria Station at approximately 10:30am. She sustained multiple injuries and was recognised as life extinct at the scene. She had sent letters and texts expressing her intention over 8/4/2013 and 9/4/2013.

Conclusion of the coroner as to the death:
She took her own life whilst suffering with anorexia nervosa","Lisa took her life whilst travelling from her home in Kent to an Inner London treatment unit, to which she had been referred due to lack of local specialist inpatient services for eating disorders, Cygnet Eating Disorders Unit in Ealing, to attend a CPA meeting. Had the unit been local, her mother may have been able to accompany her and the death averted. Throughout the course of her illness, she had been repeatedly referred out of area for specialist eating disorder services and once to a general adult psychiatric unit all because of a lack of local inpatient services. There was evidence taken of poor communication between the local community follow up services and the out of area secondary in-patient provider at points throughout her psychiatric care, such that follow up had not been organised post discharge despite the obvious need for the same.

Evidence was also taken that a friend of Lisa had passed on concerns about Lisa’s suicidal intent to the ward at Cygnet, but that this information was not appropriately acted upon until too late to take any preventative action. The evidence of Lisa’s psychiatrist was that the minimum that should have been done was for Lisa and her mother to have been contacted when this information was received by the ward, which was the day before the incident. She had not known that such information had been passed to the ward until she was writing a report following Lisa’s death. The evidence of Lisa’s mother was that had she been made aware of Lisa expressing suicidal ideation she would not have let Lisa travel back alone. It was of note that Lisa had a past history of serious suicide attempts and before each had expressed suicidal ideation in a similar manner. This failure to act upon the information received on the part of the ward staff may have contributed to the death.

Telephone record analysis was presented to the court which confirmed that the day before her death, Lisa had attempted to call the ward at Cygnet on multiple occasions, but there was only a record of one conversation with the ward staff. It was unclear whether the staff on duty the day before the incident had received any other calls and therefore it was speculation only as to whether there was any further lost opportunity to prevent this death.

Evidence was also taken during the course of the investigation that there will no longer be any specialist inpatient service for eating disorders in Kent and that instead an outpatient treatment service is to be established that involves the daily collection and drop of those suffering with eating disorders to a day centre service but no overnight care. Grave reservations about the effectiveness of such a service for patients such as Lisa were expressed by various relevantly experienced health care professionals, with difficulties anticipated in transportation and the lack of overnight supervision.","1. The shortage of local General Adult Psychiatric in-patient beds.
2. The complete lack of any local in-patient specialist eating disorder beds.
3. The communication between local services and out of area providers of psychiatric care.
4. The lack of overnight supervision of patients being treated for eating disorders in Kent.
5. The possibility of transport difficulties with potential problems on pick up such as refusal to leave the home address, not being ready at the appointed time etcetera, spending more time in transport than in therapy.
6. The failure on the part of the ward staff at Cygnet to appropriately escalate the information that they received about suicidal intent on Lisa’s part until the day after the information was received and it was too late for any preventative action to be taken.
7. Potential failures either to record calls taken from patients by the ward or insufficient staff on duty to answer the phone to patients.
8. Possible lack of training or experience on the part of Cygnet ward staff to understand the importance of receiving information about suicidal intention of one of their patients.
9. Possible lack of training or experience on the part of ward staff at Cygnet as to when and how to escalate information about suicidal intent expressed by a patient.",False,True,False,True,True,False,True,True

An inquest was opened on 23 May 2013 and was concluded on 16 January 2014","On 14 May 2013 Ryan was admitted, as an informal patient, onto the Rowan Ward at the Meadowfield Hospital, Worthing suffering from an undiagnosed mental health condition. On 20 May 2013 Ryan was being accompanied by a peer support worker from the ward to a pottery class. When he got to the reception area of the hospital he took off, left the hospital and ran towards the A27 road. Witnesses then saw Ryan running along the pavement alongside the road when for no reason he changed direction and ran straight out in front of the articulated lorry. It appeared that this was a deliberate act.

Ryan subsequently died on 22 May 2013 at Southampton Hospital from the injuries he had sustained. The cause of death that was reported was that he had died from 1a Catastrophic brain injury and 1b Polytrauma.","1. During the course of the evidence it was shown that there was a lack of understanding by staff of the Trust's Leave for Non-detained Patients Policy.
2. Staff seemed unclear as to whether or not this policy should be applied when patients left the ward to attend activities within the hospital grounds. If it was to be applied then it was not strictly adhered to in Ryan's case. The nurse in charge did not carry out an assessment, as required under para 4.5, of Ryan at the time he left the ward.
3. Staff appeared to be unclear as to the role of a peer support worker with regards to whether or not they are able to fulfil the role of an escort for patients leaving the ward. The peer support worker who gave evidence indicated that she did not consider herself an escort but she was a responsible adult who accompanied patients. In Ryan's case the doctor had approved his leave only when accompanied by an escort. The terminology used in the policy causes this confusion.
4. Ryan's risk assessment and health care plan was not completed within the required period. This plan was completed two days after it should have been.
5. There was lack of written information provided to families by the hospital on admission to help them support their family member. It appears that this information is at present only given to the patient. In addition the family were not provided with a copy of Ryan's care plan.
6. There appeared to be a general lack of security on the ward with regards to visitors. There was no consistent signing in procedure and family members could be on the ward without there being a record being kept.",False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

The investigations concluded at the end of the inquests on 14 January 2014. The conclusions of the inquests were that May Stokoe was killed unlawfully and that James Henderson Stokoe killed himself.,"On 1 May 2013 at [REDACTED] Sunderland, May Stokoe was attacked with a knife and sustained fatal injuries, and James Henderson Stokoe at the same address, by the use of a knife inflicted upon himself fatal injuries.","Mr and Mrs Stokoe had been married for 56 years. Following Mr Stokoe being diagnosed with bladder cancer he attempted to take his own life which prompted a referral to Mental Health Services. Although there were no reported incidents of domestic violence, it was clear from the evidence before me that the relationship of Mr and Mrs Stokoe was a distant and difficult one. Notwithstanding prescribed medication and the intervention of Mental Health Services, there was an incident on 1 May 2013 at the matrimonial home which led to the unlawful killing of Mrs Stokoe and with Mr Stokoe killing himself. An independent review of the circumstances of the deaths was commissioned by the Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust. A number of findings and recommendations were made and I was informed that the Trust accepted them in their entirety and that an action plan would be put in place to progress them. I am concerned to ensure that lessons that have been learnt locally are not lost nationally and I should be grateful if you would confirm that steps will be taken by you to progress matters.

I was also concerned about the possibility that carers or partners of individuals who are subject to the provision of Mental Health Services are not formally consulted about the welfare of the patient/service user. Although I was satisfied that domestic abuse awareness was an integral part of training for Mental Health staff, the circumstances of the deaths of Mr and Mrs Stokoe did raise for me concerns that more formal involvement of a carer/partner may allow them to make disclosures which might better inform the assessment process. For example, information from them may corroborate or verify that being provided by the service user/patient. In my view carers/partners may be a very valuable seam of information which may not necessarily be disclosed or volunteered by the service user or patient. Carers/partners should have more visibility to the Mental Health Services and domestic abuse involving the elderly cannot be discounted and matters should be approached with an open mind.
I emphasised at the conclusion of the inquests that no one could have predicted the extreme circumstances of the deaths of Mr and Mrs Stokoe and that I was in no way criticising the Trust. Whilst risk cannot be entirely eliminated it would be helpful if you indicate what steps can be taken to improve service provision.

The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased died from asphyxia caused by hanging, that he died in the grounds of the Cygnet Hospital, Wyke whilst detained at that hospital under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983, that he took his own life whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed, and that his death was contributed to by neglect in that the deceased’s Responsible Clinician had not been given information about serious incidents which were known to nursing staff at the hospital which led the Responsible Clinician to make an inappropriate decision to grant the deceased unescorted leave which gave him the opportunity to take his own life.","The circumstances of the death were summarised in a narrative verdict by the jury at the inquest, which is in turn further summarised at paragraph 3, above.

(2) The hospital’s systems by which decisions about patients’ care made by the Responsible Clinician were communicated to nursing staff appeared not to have operated properly and accordingly may be inadequate to ensure that such information about such decisions is communicated in an appropriate and/or timely manner.

(3) There appeared to be no system of checking upon or auditing the systems referred to at paragraphs (1) and (2) above to ensure that the Responsible Clinician was receiving full, accurate and up to date information and that nursing staff were receiving appropriate and timely information about the Responsible Clinician’s decisions.

Narrative conclusion: On 6 September 2012 Roshen Abbas Ladak-Ebrahim was referred by the walk in centre to Barnet Primary Health Care Trust who forwarded the urgent referral to the Brent Assessment and Brief Treatment Team. On 11 September 2012 a nurse contacted Mr Ladak-Ebrahim and an appointment was made for an assessment on 20 September 2012 the nurse who spoke to Mr Ladak-Ebrahim had spoken to his mother on 10 September 2012 and was told Mr Ladak-Ebrahim’s history including the episode of self-harm and raised her concerns. On 20 September 2012 Mr Ladak-Ebrahim was taken by his father for his assessment. Mr Ladak-Ebrahim was prescribed medication by a doctor following a multi-disciplinary meeting after Mr Ladak-Ebrahim was assessed by the nurse. Mr Ladak-Ebrahim was not seen by a doctor and no formal follow up meeting was arranged. Mr Ladak-Ebrahim contacted his GP on 10 October 2012 and the GP sent a fax to Brent Assessment and Brief Treatment Team requesting an urgent assessment. On 11 October 2012 at 13.29 hrs a nurse contacted Mr Ladak-Ebrahim by telephone and it is likely at that time he was at an immediate risk of harming himself. The nurse wanted Mr Ladak-Ebrahim to be seen by a doctor but was told that no doctor was available and a referral was made to the Home Treatment Team. The referral to the Home Treatment Team was not accepted until the nurse spoke to the Home Treatment Team the next day. Mr Ladak-Ebrahim had been found having hanged himself at his home on the evening of 11 October 2012.,Mr Ladak-Ebrahim had contact with a number of health care professionals and was living at home with his mother.

The suggestion at the inquest was to firstly assess and record whether there is an immediate risk of self-harm. If there is no immediate risk of self-harm then the assessment should focus on whether there are any thoughts of self-harm (recording frequency, duration, intensity etc). Whether there is a plan (recording the details of the plan or plans, etc) and whether there is an intention to end life. Whether the individual is vulnerable to acting on impulse and any past history. The use of high, medium and low risk were considered unhelpful when assessing risk of self-harm. Consideration to be given to giving guidance to health care professionals on the steps that should be taken to ensure that a patient is kept safe by those looking after the patient. In particular informing those looking after a patient that the patient should not be left alone where there is a concern that the patient is at risk of harming themselves. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that there was some confusion over whether this advice would breach a patient’s confidentiality. Consideration to be given to guidance whereby a doctor working in the community mental health agencies is required to have a consultation with a patient before prescribing medication that carries an increased risk of self-harm when first prescribed and arranges to see the patient again to assess the effect of the medication.",False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False

Tweddle,County Durham and Darlington,"Chief Constable, Durham Constabulary",On 10 June 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Robert Wilkinson aged 65 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 October 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased intentionally took his own life,"The deceased had been a firearms and shotgun certificate holder for a number of years. Although there had been some historic incidents with regard to his licence, no issues of concern had been raised with the Constabulary for many years. In late 2012, the Police became aware, through a change in family circumstances, that a question of the deceased’s suitability to continue being a certificate holder was raised and enquiries and reports received led to Deputy Chief Constable [REDACTED] signing a Letter of Revocation for the certificates on 3 May 2013. It was intended that the revocation letter being personally served upon the deceased. It was not so served prior to his death. The deceased was a very keen shooter and was suffering from a terminal illness. The deceased shot himself with one of his firearms the day after being discharged from hospital. It was never thought by the Police that the deceased was a threat to any third party.","(1) As part of the process leading to the decision to revoke, although there had been contact with the deceased/his family/medical practitioner, there had not been a face to face meeting between a member of the firearms licensing team and the deceased. Such a meeting would have provided better quality of information to enable those considering the issue of revocation to have made the decision on the best possible information

(2) The revocation letter was never personally served. The deceased was in hospital for some of the time. Contact had been made with the deceased’s family, in particular his son, and whilst it may not have been said in clear terms, the inference clearly was that the deceased was to have his certificates revoked and it was the deceased’s son who communicated this information to his father and not the Police. Further consideration needs to be given as to the most appropriate means by which a decision to revoke should be made known to the certificate holder. It is accepted that this was a difficult case for the Police to manage, but clearly if the deceased had not had access to his guns on the day that he shot himself then he would not have been able to take his own life in the way that he did on the day that he did. Thus, an objective review how this case was managed should be undertaken so that improvements to the system might be identified with the result that similar fatalities in the future might be avoided.",False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 September 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased took her own life with a medical cause of death of 1a) hanging.","The deceased had been admitted to Lanchester Road Hospital, a hospital run by Tees, Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust following a previous suicide attempt and was discharged from the hospital on 14 February 2013. Upon discharge she was given a supply of medication which on balance was greater than that which she was able to have prescribed to her whilst in the community. In addition when she was discharged her family were not advised of this and there was thus no contact between them and the deceased. Following family concerns she was found dead in her house hanging on 16 February 2013 though it is unclear when she actually died.","(1) The deceased was discharged from hospital with 3 days prescription of her medication. In the community she had to collect her prescription on a daily basis to reduce the risk of self-harm or suicide. The Consultant Psychiatrist giving evidence at the inquest said that he was unaware of this.
(2) Upon discharge the hospital did not contact the family to make them aware of her discharge even though family members had visited the deceased whilst in hospital. It may well have been that if the family had contacted the deceased upon her discharge and given support that her death could have been avoided.
(3) The deceased was discharged from hospital on the Thursday and no follow up visit from a nurse was scheduled until the following Monday. The Consultant Psychiatrist attending the inquest giving evidence confirmed that this was too long a time taking into account all of the circumstances of the case and a nurse should have made contact with the deceased probably the next day or the Friday though he was unable to say whether this might have made any difference in all the circumstances.",True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False

Harding,Kent Mid and Medway,Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust,On 23 May 2012 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ricky Anderson. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 August 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was that Ricky Anderson killed himself while suffering from depression by means of suspension,"On the 29 March 2012 Ricky Anderson was informally admitted to hospital experiencing command hallucinations with suicidal thoughts. As his symptoms coincided with substance misuse it was felt they were drug related rather than representing psychotic illness. He was discharged on the 5 April 2012 but readmitted two days later when his symptoms returned. He continued to express suicidal and delusional thoughts intermittently whilst at hospital and was discharged earlier than planned on the 16 April 2012 with medication which had improved his symptoms. He went to stay with a relative for a short time but did not see anyone from the Access team after his return to the area. On the morning of the 21 May 2012 Ricky Anderson was found at Chatham Cemetery suspended from a tree. There was no evidence of third party involvement, a note in his handwriting was found on his person indicating his reasons for taking his life.","(1) It was established in evidence at the inquest that practitioners from the Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust did not inform Mr. Anderson’s GP of his involvement with primary care on either occasion he was admitted to hospital, resulting in him not being able to obtain a further supply of medication without the intervention of his family.

(2) Evidence was given at the inquest that following Mr. Anderson’s discharge from hospital a number of attempts were made to contact him to assess his wellbeing and needs. Although Mr. Anderson was spoken to briefly, it was accepted by the Trust that too much reliance was placed on information from family members. As a result Mr. Anderson had virtually no contact with the Access team prior to his death. I understand that a practice note has recently been drafted which is intended to be used as guidance. Mr. Anderson’s discharge from hospital occurred at an earlier stage than had been planned as he wished to leave and was deemed safe to do so. As a consequence, a care plan had not been put in place to establish his needs. I heard evidence that following Mr. Anderson’s death procedures have been put in place to ensure that this situation does not reoccur.",False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False
6014,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/john-walker/,2013-0213,2013-08-21,C. Wilkinson,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove","Lisa Rodrigues, Chief Executive, Sussex Partnership NHS Trust","On 6 June 2012 the senior coroner for West Sussex commenced an investigation into the death of John Leon Naylor Walker born 12 September 1940, being age 71 at the date of his death. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 May 2012 following two days of evidence (on 3 May and 21 May 2012). The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Walker had died as a result of hanging and that he had taken his own life whilst suffering from depression and anxiety.","Mr Walker had a history of mental health issues which developed in 2006 when he suffered a sudden breakdown, attempting two overdoses of prescription medicine. He was gradually nursed back to full mental health by 2009 and lived a reported full and illness free life until March 2012.

On 10 April 2012, an altercation with a neighbour triggered a further breakdown as a result of which, via referral to mental health services, he was hospitalised as a voluntary patient at Langley Green hospital, West Sussex on 10 April 2012 with symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation. Langley Green is not a Psychiatric Intensive care unit (i.e. it is not secure), but it does control visitors to the wards and monitors its patients.

Mr Walker stabilised on the ward, which he had described as a safe environment where he felt he could be protected from his impulsivity to self-harm in times of low mood.

Despite repeated denials about ongoing suicidal ideation, and an apparent improvement in his condition, Mr Walker made a further serious and impulsive attempt on his life on 19 April whilst on a visit home.

Mr Walker was subsequently released from the hospital's care on 1 May 2012, under supervision of the Crisis Resolution Team. He continued to express suicidal thoughts to his family and on 14 May made a further opportunistic attempt on his life when his wife was distracted for a period of 10 minutes on the phone.

Following an assessment at a local hospital (St Richard's) on 14 May, Mr Walker was re-admitted, as a voluntary patient, to Langley Green on 17 May 2012. He was assessed on admission by a second year core trainee in Psychiatry, who whilst having sight of his transfer notes, could not recall reviewing the 'e-notes' on the system (which would have been her normal practice) and did not have available to her notes from Mr Walker's first admission to the hospital as they were at another location for Mr Walker's discharge summary. A full assessment was undertaken with Mr Walker in person, but the doctor did not get an opportunity to meet or discuss matters with his wife.

The assessment considered his prior attempts on his life and the apparent speed and impulsivity with which they had been undertaken. His playing down of their severity in interview was taken as an indication that his risk was unlikely to have changed quickly and he was admitted on existing observations on account of the perceived high risk that he posed to himself.

In evidence, the doctor felt sure that she would have conveyed her views over his impulsivity and speed of action to nursing staff, and whilst it was noted in her notes that his risk was very difficult to assess, it was clear that the wider picture of these factors had not been fully ascertained. In evidence, she had described how she had explained on a number of occasions to the hospital the fact that Mr Walker was impulsive but that he had good insight of his condition and understood and feared his impulsivity. Mr Walker, it was said by his wife, described himself frequently as 'needing to be protected' and 'to be kept safe until his medication worked'. The doctor was not aware of comments and specific concerns which had been raised by the family and it appears therefore that these were not effectively conveyed. It was believed by the doctor however that the nursing staff would have been aware of these matters from previous contact.

On 18 May, observations were reduced to 10 minutes.

On 19 May a risk care plan for Mr Walker was prepared. This was undertaken by a temporary charge nurse without, it appeared, wider input from the MDT. The nurse, the evidence established, had not been present at admission. The risk care plan was based on admission notes, but was not informed by any wider discussion with the MDT or family. It was not recalled as to whether it was subsequently discussed with staff. The risk plan was described as only being meant to be a 'stop gap' as a guide for the team, in the belief that a fuller risk assessment would be undertaken. It proved however to be only a factual recount of the events leading up to Mr Walker's admission, failed to expand or consider any of the comments raised in the admission assessment and made no mention of impulsivity, known triggers, predictive factors, or of the aspects which Mr Walker could audit, which was of particular concern to the family. No further risk assessment was undertaken or risk care plan prepared, although the inquest was not able to establish why.

On 19 May observations were reduced to 15 minutes and on 24 May, were further reduced to 30 minutes. There was no clear indication in the notes as to the reasoning for this, decisions it was established being based on MDT discussions, recording only the changes in observations and not the rationale. Observations remained at 30 minutes until 1 June 2012.

On 1 June, at some point just after 10.30am, following the 30 minute observation, Mr Walker, with the assistance of a stool from the common room, scaled a 2 metre fence surrounding the ward's courtyard, entered the outer gardens of the hospital, scaled a further exterior fence and travelled a distance of approximately 0.25 miles on foot before being across a secluded area of wood by grazing fields.

The evidence showed that Mr Walker had found a length of fencing tape at the location which he used to suspend himself from a tree at some time between 11.10 to 11.15am. Mr Walker was not discovered missing from the hospital until the next observations round for him at 11am. The police were called (following the instigation of the hospital's AWOL policy and a thorough search of the hospital) at 11.50am. Police confirmed that Mr Walker was discovered by passers-by at approximately 11.15am that morning.","(1) The consideration of, contribution to and preparation involved in risk care planning for Mr Walker was insufficient in its scope and depth in order to provide any informed basis on which an active and proper assessment of his continuing risk (factors) could be made. Properly detailed, and the issues communicated amongst all members of the MDT, this may have better informed thinking with regard to the observation levels set. It is of concern that this risk care plan was neither revisited nor revised.
(2) There was no clear rationale provided for changes in observation levels in the notes or any explanation given in writing as to the considerations or risk factors taken into account. Whilst accepted that these matters may have been discussed, written evidence would have provided clarity and a point of reference for further assessment in light of any change in presentation or condition. The fact that observation levels only decreased (despite evidence heard at the inquest that Mr Walker was expressing even darker and suicidal thoughts in the week before his death), without explanation, remains of concern.
(3) Whilst it was accepted in evidence that the hospital's AWOL policy was robust and activated and implemented appropriately, concern was raised by the family with regard to the length of time taken before Mr Walker could be declared missing and the police informed.
(4) At the time of the incident the fences surrounding the external common areas of the ward were of a scalable height by any patient determined enough to do so. It is accepted that this has been subsequently addressed.",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False

Palmer,London South,"Chief Executive, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust","At the time of Nicola’s death I opened an inquest. The inquest concluded on 14 August 2013. A copy of the Record of the Inquest is attached. Your Trust was represented at the hearing by [REDACTED] of Bevan Brittan, solicitors. The family was represented by counsel, [REDACTED].","As set out on the record of the inquest:

Nicola Matthews had a long history of borderline personality disorder. She had performed many acts of self-harm, necessitating a number of hospital admissions. On 12 October 2010 she took an overdose of drugs and was admitted to hospital, where she was detained under section 5 of the Mental Health Act. This detention was rescinded by her responsible medical officer on 15 October. Nicola wished to be allowed to leave hospital and was permitted to do so on the understanding that her partner would accommodate her. There was a lack of clarity about the follow-up arrangements but this probably was not causative of her subsequent consumption of drugs at her partner’s home later that evening. Her partner woke from sleep at about 01.30h on 16 October to find Nicola unrousable. She was conveyed by ambulance to hospital where she was pronounced dead. Her intentions are not clear beyond reasonable doubt and her actions were probably not accidental.","My concern is about the way in which the outcome of decisions taken by the consultant on the ward round on 15 October 2010 were documented and implemented. The contemporaneous note in the EPJS was conceded to be an incomplete record of everything that was decided on the ward round. Nicola had a long-standing history of borderline personality disorder and was constantly at risk of self-harm. Her acts were frequently impulsive. Whilst she had been sectioned on 12 October, the Section 5 order was rescinded on 15 October at the ward round. Nicola was then insistent on being allowed to leave the hospital.

The follow-up arrangements made for her continuing care were not clear and were not documented. Evidence at my inquest suggested that there was no clarity as to what the follow-up arrangements were and whether or not they were made clear either to Nicola or to her partner.

In the event, Nicola went home and later that evening took an overdose of medication which resulted in her death. Whilst it is not possible to state that better arrangements for follow-up would probably have made a difference to the outcome, I am concerned to ensure that in future patients who are discharged have a clear understanding of follow-up arrangements. It is important that staff members on the ward who have to handle the departure of the patient from the ward have clarity as to what is to happen. In the case of Nicola, with the period of time between the decision being made and her actually leaving, staff had changed and the contemporaneous documents did not allow the member of staff who escorted Nicola off the ward to have a clear understanding of follow-up arrangements or indeed of the nature of and quantity of medication with which she was being discharged.

I suggest that consideration should be given to formulating better advice and ensuring that important decisions are better documented and that follow-up arrangements are made clear and adequately documented.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
