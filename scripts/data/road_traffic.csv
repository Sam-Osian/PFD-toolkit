Travers,Surrey,Toyota (GB) PLC; Toyota Motor Corporation; Toyota Motor Europe NV/SA; The Secretary of State for Business and Trade; The Secretary of State for the Department of Transport; Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency,"I commenced an investigation into the death of Lisa Marie Bowen. The inquest concluded on 1 August 2025 when I found that the medical cause of death was: Ia traumatic head and spinal injuries and my conclusion as to the death was: road traffic collision. I subsequently held a hearing, on 6 November 2025, to receive evidence relating to the prevention of future deaths.","On the morning of 11 January 2022, Lisa Bowen was driving her Toyota Corolla motor car on the M25 motorway when its rear offside tyre deflated. A tyre deflation warning light probably appeared on the dashboard, but it was not possible to ascertain whether Ms Bowen saw it and, if she did, whether or how she responded. She drove on for at least several miles, as a result of which the tyre was damaged and its tread and parts of its sidewalls detached. Following the tyre detachment, Ms Bowen braked, indicated, and moved on to the hard shoulder. Once on the hard shoulder, she pressed the brake pedal a further five times, with increasing force, but this did not result in any significant reduction in the Toyota’s speed. In consequence, the vehicle did not stop prior to colliding into, and under-running, the rear of a lorry which was present and stationary on the hard shoulder. The Toyota’s speed at the time of the collision was 37.9 miles per hour. The collision occurred 17 seconds after the tyre detachment and ten seconds after the Toyota moved on to the hard shoulder. The collision caused catastrophic damage to the Toyota and, as a result, Ms Bowen suffered fatal injuries and died instantaneously. If the brakes had worked effectively, there would have been time and distance for the Toyota to have stopped before the collision. The brakes did not work effectively because, when the brake pedal was pressed, the vehicle’s anti-locking braking system was activated, and it operated to reduce the braking effect almost entirely. The anti-locking braking system was working in accordance with its design. The outcome was an unintended effect of the system’s design which arose because the specific scenario, of tyre detachment occurring whilst the vehicle was being driven, which was thought to be a rare occurrence, had not been taken into account in the design process. My full findings are set out in the Findings and Conclusion document which is sent with this report.","Concern 1 As stated above, the brakes on the Deceased’s Toyota Corolla did not work effectively because, when the brake pedal was pressed, the vehicle’s anti-locking braking system was activated, and it operated to reduce the braking effect almost entirely. At the inquest I heard evidence that: (i) Following the tyre detachment, the speed of the wheel with a detached tyre was much higher than the speed of the three other wheels with undamaged tyres. (ii) The anti-locking braking system recognised this differential in speed, but perceived that the problem lay with the three slower wheels and assumed that they had locked or were at risk of doing so. (iii) Consequently, each time the brake was applied, the anti-locking braking system immediately released the braking pressure to the three slower wheels in order to avoid them locking, thereby prioritising the preservation stability and steerability over braking. (iv) In this way, the anti-locking braking system was working in accordance with its design. (v) The system was unable to recognise that the problem in fact lay with the fourth wheel which was rotating much more quickly than the other wheels because its tyre had detached. (vi) The outcome was an unintended effect of the system’s design which arose because the specific scenario, of tyre detachment occurring whilst the vehicle was being driven, which was thought to be a rare occurrence, had not been taken into account in the design process. (vii) Testing of anti-locking braking systems and braking performance, following a tyre detachment, is not undertaken by the industry as a whole and, therefore, relevant data is not collated. At the inquest and PFD hearing I was informed that – (i) A large number Toyota Corolla motor cars continue to be driven on the roads of the UK with the same anti-locking braking system as was in Ms Bowen’s vehicle. (ii) Anti-locking braking systems are developed by a small number of specialist companies and it may well be that other vehicles currently on the roads of the UK have systems similar to that in Ms Bowen’s car. (iii) The company which developed the anti-locking braking system used in Ms Bowen’s car (Advics) has since developed and improved its system so that it is better able to recognise if one wheel speed is so different from the others that the data from that wheel should be ignored as unreliable. However, the improvements are not foolproof, not least because acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle affects this function. (iv) The anti-locking braking system now used in Toyota Corolla motor cars has been developed by a different company (Bosch) and it is not known by Toyota precisely how it would respond following a tyre detachment whilst the vehicle is being driven. (v) It seems that relevant regulations concerning anti-locking braking systems do not address or specify requirements relating to the scenario faced by Ms Bowen. Although the detachment of a tyre whilst a vehicle is being driven is thought to be a rare occurrence, I am concerned that that may not be the case and that if it were to happen again, in the same or similar circumstances, the risk of future death continues.

Concern 2 This concern relates to the catastrophic failure of the under-run protection bar (‘the Device’) that was in place on the lorry with which Ms Bowen collided. At the inquest I heard and accepted expert evidence which established that: (i) The Device was compliant with all relevant regulations and legal requirements, save only that fixing bolts of an incorrect strength had been used to attach it to the lorry’s chassis. (ii) The strength of the Device was grossly insufficient, either to have prevented any underrun, or even to have reduced the extent of the Toyota’s under-run. (iii) The Device would not have been strong enough to do so even if the correct fixing bolts had been used. One expert stated that he was aware that some under-run protection devices are capable of providing protection against much greater forces than is currently required under the law and he expressed disappointment that the relevant legislation and regulations are not more robustly framed, so as to require the use of these much stronger devices. I am concerned that, in the absence of more stringent requirements in relation to the degree of force that an under-run protection device should be capable of withstanding, a risk of future death arises.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Female,Driver

Hodson,Birmingham and Solihull,Secretary of State for Transport; DVLA; The General Medical Council; The General Optical Council,On 21 April 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Graham Ayerst Sampson. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was: Road traffic collision,"Chris was a front seat passenger in a Mazda automobile (registration [REDACTED]) being driven along the A45 Coventry Road towards Birmingham in South Yardley on 1/4/22. It was daylight; the road surface was dry; the weather was clear; and the speed limit was 40mph. At around 18:54, the driver of a Mercedes E220 automobile (registration [REDACTED]) was seen to have a medical episode at the wheel whilst stationary at a set of traffic lights at the junction of Holder Road/Forest Road before then driving off at high speed. The Mercedes travelled a distance of approximately 0.4 miles, changing lanes and reached speeds in excess of 100mph before colliding into the back of the Mazda between the junction of Redhill Road and Kings Road. The collision forced the Mazda across the central reservation and to collide with a road sign before becoming airborne and then landing on its roof on the opposite side of the carriageway. The emergency services attended rapidly, but sadly Chris had sustained unsurvivable injuries and was declared deceased at the scene at 19:43.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a MULTIPLE TRAUMATIC INJURIES

1b ROAD TRAFFIC COLLISION AS A FRONT SEAT CAR PASSENGER","1. I heard evidence in this inquest concerning the requirement of drivers to self-notify the DVLA of any medical conditions that may interfere with their driving. The evidence in this inquest was that the driver of the vehicle that caused the fatal road traffic collision - due to an unexpected medical event at the wheel - had a number of health issues. As it could not be proven which medical condition caused him to suffer the medical event, it could not be said that he should (or even could) have regulated his driving accordingly.
2. Furthermore, the driver’s medical records were ambiguous as to whether he had been explicitly told to notify the DVLA of his health conditions.
3. The evidence was that the driver played “fast and loose” with the DVLA but that he had not committed any crime.
4. The issue of drivers failing to self-refer their health issues to the DVLA for assessment is a serious and persisting issue. From the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website for Prevention of Future Deaths (https://www.judiciary.uk/?s=&pfd_report_type=&post_type=pfd&order=relevance), I am aware of at least 6 PFD reports being issued in the past 3 years (References - Ref: 2025-0523 (3 deaths); Ref: 2025-0196; Ref: 2024-0507; Ref: 2025-0031; Ref: 2025-0214; Ref: 2024-0127).
5. Following scrutiny of those reports, it is apparent that the DVLA and Department of Transport previously called for evidence in 2023 seeking views on the current legislative basis for establishing whether a person was medically fit to drive. At that time, officials were considering that evidence and considering policy options as part of the government’s road safety strategy which was being developed and the details would be provided, “in due course”.
6. Two years later from that call for evidence, and still no national strategy has been announced. I understand that in August 2025 His Majesty’s Government announced that a new Road Safety Strategy would be published in the autumn of 2025. However, we are now in the depths of November and there is no sign currently of any Road Safety Strategy being published.
7. I am aware that the DVLA publishes guidance on GOV.UK called “Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals” to support healthcare professionals (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessing-fitness-to-drive-a-guide-for-medical-professionals). What is unclear, however, is whether a) that guidance is well known amongst medical professionals, and b) whether that process is an effective mechanism for doctors to report patients with health issues, as there does not appear to be any published statistical evidence on the issue.
8. I am also aware that the General Medical Council (GMC) and the General Optical Council (GOC) offer guidance about notifying DVLA when the person cannot or will not exercise their own legal duty to do so. Again, it is unclear whether a) that guidance is well known amongst medical professionals, and b) whether that process is an effective mechanism for doctors to report patients with health issues, as there does not appear to be any published statistical evidence on the issue.
9. Drivers may not self-report medical conditions due to a variety of reasons. This can be due to a lack of understanding, insight, or simply because someone has not explicitly told them what to do or how to do it. There are then those who are reckless and knowingly avoid notifying the DVLA of a health condition when explicitly told to do so - either through arrogance, pride or through fear of losing employment. The end result is the same: people are dying needlessly on our roads due to people who, legally, should not be on our roads.
10. There is a risk of future deaths occurring where drivers do not self-refer their conditions to the DVLA, or where medical professionals do not report those health issues to protect the wider public.
11. It is not for I, as Coroner, to tell you what action should be taken. However, it is part of my judicial function to bring this matter to your attention so that you – individually and collectively – can consider what steps can and should be taken to reduce the risk of deaths occurring in the future.",False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Other

Davies,Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly,Service Director for Environment Cornwall Council,"On 16 December 2024, I commenced an investigation into the death of 22-year-old Samuel George VASS.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 October 2025.

The inquest found the medical cause of death as follows

1a Head Injury

The inquest answered the four statutory questions - who, when, where and how - as follows …

Samuel George VASS died on 14 December 2024 on the A3083 near RNAS Culdrose Helston Cornwall from trauma consistent with injuries sustained after the vehicle that Sammy was driving crossed the carriageway into the opposite lane and collided with an oncoming vehicle. Sammy had a blood alcohol level well over twice the legal limit which will have significantly impaired his driving. It is likely that Sammy lost control of his vehicle on a bend due to driving at excessive speed for the conditions, whilst under the influence of alcohol.

The conclusion of the inquest was as follows

Road Traffic Collision","Mr Vass was a Royal Navy serviceman based at Royal Navy Air Station (RNAS) at Culdrose in Cornwall. He had planned to attend a social event in Helston on the night of his death. There was clear evidence that he had been drinking alcohol before he drove that night.

During the journey from RNAS Culdrose to Helston the car being driven by Mr Vass crossed the carriageway into the path of another vehicle [REDACTED] who had just picked up her father [REDACTED] from Helston. [REDACTED] had no opportunity to avoid the subsequent collision.

[REDACTED] suffered life changing injuries as a result of the collision, and her father [REDACTED] suffered serious injuries.","The concern is the absence of speed enforcement on the stretch of the A3083 road between RNAS Culdrose and Helston.

There have been a number of road traffic collisions on this stretch of the A3083. Mr Vass is the fourth person to be killed on this stretch of road in the last six years. In 2022 two servicemen were killed after a road traffic collision in which the cause of the collision was found to be grossly excessive speed by the deceased driver. In Mr Vass’ death, excessive speeding was found to have caused him to lose control of his car and cross the carriageway, contributed to by Mr Vass driving with excess alcohol.

On this stretch of road the court heard that there are options for the installation of speed enforcement either by way of an average speed camera system or a fixed camera system.",False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,22,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 17 October 2025.

The medical cause of death is
1a) chest injuries
1b) road traffic collision (motorcyclist)

The conclusion of the inquest as to how Mr Lewis came to his death was a road traffic collision whilst being pursued by the police.","The deceased was Alexander Rhys Lewis and he was pronounced dead on 2 December 2025 at St Helens Road, Swansea. The cause of death was chest injuries caused by a road traffic collision in which he was a motorcyclist.

The collision has occurred shortly after Alex, whilst riding a Yamaha motorcycle, failed to stop for a South Wales Police Roads Policing Units on the Kingsway, Swansea. The Yamaha motorcycle has entered onto St Helens Road from the direction of the Kingsway roundabout where it has carried out an overtake of an unidentified white motor vehicle in the vicinity of the pedestrian crossing. The Yamaha motorcycle then appears to accelerate after completing this manoeuvre. At the same time, the silver Toyota Prius has been in the process of emerging slowly from the give way junction of Wyndham Street and turning right onto St Helens Road. On seeing the Toyota Prius, the rider of the Yamaha motorcycle has braked heavily causing the motorcycle to go into a sideways skid, where the motorcycle's off side has collided heavily with the off side of the Toyota. Alex was pronounced deceased at the scene.","1. There was no opportunity for the pursuing driver to communicate a dynamic risk assessment to the control centre, to assist the control centre in making a decision to authorise or stand down the pursuit. The control centre indicated that such information would go towards authorising the pursuit as opposed to standing it down in the present case.

2. The number of tasks having to be undertaken by the pursuing driver meant that vital information as to the risks involved in continuing the pursuit were missed, in the present case that being a contravention of a red light.

I elected to hear these three inquests in succession because they raised common issues. This Regulation 28 report addresses those issues.",Each of these three deaths occurred when a driver had a medical episode which caused them to lose control of their vehicle. In each case the drivers had been aware of their propensity to experience such episodes. In each case the drivers had been advised not to drive. Each of the drivers was subsequently convicted of causing death by dangerous driving.,"(1) The DVLA witnesses confirmed to me that the scheme created by section 94 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 requires that 'licence holders' notify the DVLA if they suffer from a relevant or prospective disability. In turn the DVLA place the emphasis on the expectation that licence holders will themselves honestly inform the DVLA of their condition. Although medical professionals can inform the DVLA of a patient's unfitness to drive, the DVLA proceed on the basis that notifications will not usually come via this route.

In each of these three inquests the drivers responsible for the collisions had repeatedly lied to the DVLA about their fitness to drive. I was told that this was 'disappointing' but not wholly surprising.

I am aware that HM Senior Coroner for Lancashire and Blackburn with Darwen addressed a PFD report to you (ref: 2025-0196) on 24 April 2025 in which a death had been caused by a driver who, by reason of their condition, lacked the necessary insight to self-refer to the DVLA.

Each of these cases illustrate the problem with expecting that those who have medical impairments should self-refer to the DVLA. There will be cases where, despite repeated advice not to drive, a person is unable or unwilling to inform the DVLA of their situation. My concern is that this risks future deaths. I consider that whilst self-referral remains the default position, more drivers will be able to continue driving whilst endangering lawful road users.",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,70,Male,Other

Sharpstone,Suffolk,Secretary of State for Defence,On 12 May 2025 I formally resumed the inquest into the death of Catherine Moore. I concluded the inquest on 4 September 2025,"Catherine Moore died on 3 June 2022 following a road traffic collision between an MOD Land Rover and an HGV, causing the latter to cross the central reservation, crushing Catherine’s car causing her fatal traumatic injuries.
The primary cause of the RTC on the balance of probabilities was the defective steering of the MOD Land Rover leading to the initial collision with the HGV. On the balance of probabilities, inadequate maintenance and repair of the MOD Land Rover contributed more than minimally to the defective steering. Accordingly, on the balance of probabilities, substandard maintenance and repair of the MOD Land Rover steering contributed more than minimally to Catherine’s death.

A Land Rover expert who examined the MOD Land Rover after the RTC noted that:

At some stage the steering box has become misaligned with the steering wheel.
At some stage the steering wheel has been taken off and put back on the central position but without assessing the steering box.
There was no evidence the steering box had been opened and examined.
The inner race and bearings were damaged significantly affecting the steering.
The steering box was defective over a period of several thousand miles as evidenced by brinelling.

The prop shaft on the Land Rover was badly worn and about to fail.
The steering links were unevenly threaded.
The rear trailing link was bent.
There were different tyres on the front and back of the Land Rover.

The Joint Asset and Management System (JAMES), a system that oversees the governance of repair and maintenance of MOD vehicles, had deemed the MOD Land Rover FF (Fully Fit) for service at the time of the accident with all mandated inspections recorded as complete on the JAMES maintenance history.","I found that:

1. With regards to JAMES and its function supporting maintenance and repair of the MOD Land Rover:

The terminology and descriptors on JAMES forms were very difficult to understand and it was unclear how data could be extracted for governance purposes.

There are no details of the referrer if checks are needed with regards to the reasons for the referral.
There is no check in the system allowing feedback to the referrer

Limited reasons were given for entry into JAMES e.g. for failure of a vehicular part. This may limit the breadth of maintenance and/or repair with regards to any mechanical issues associated with the fault.

There are limited details of work done other than task closed or fully fit i.e. few details on how a repair was done or what difficulties with the repair may have been encountered.

There is little formal space on system for suggestions with regards to further work or maintenance on the matter attended to and repaired.

There is lack of clarity on how to locate data and information on the maintenance and repairs.

There was no evidence of ability or to process or extract data from JAMES to facilitate systems and process audits

The rationale and/or schedule in JAMES for some processes for e.g. ad hoc inspections was unclear.
The user interface is unclear.

The tabling and format are unclear.

There was repetition of identical time and dates attached to different tasks.

There is no formal searchable database e.g. for serious or recurrent issues and themes.

2

The conclusion of the inquest as recorded by the jury empanelled to hear the inquest was that Leonardo Cardoso Machado died at Lindsay Road near junction with St Aldhelm's Rd, Poole, Dorset on 16 April 2023.

On balance of probability the fact the police attempted to effect a traffic stop at the County Gates Gyratory caused Leo to ""make off"" at high speed through the red traffic lights to continue to travel at speed along Lindsay Rd.
The excessive speed of the motorbike driven by Leo was the causative factor in the collision causing Leo to lose control at the bend in the road and drive into the railings on Lindsay Rd.
The cause of death was traumatic head and neck injuries caused by the road traffic collision.","Leo was 17 years of age at the time of his death. Leo “rented” an “Uber Eats” delivery licence, though he was too young to obtain such a licence himself. As a result of the rented licence, Leo was able to earn money as a food delivery driver.
In the early hours of 16 April 2023 Leo was riding a 599cc Yamaha sports bike with an “Uber Eats” delivery box attached to the rear. He was not licenced to use such a motorcycle, which requires a full category A driving licence, with the licence holder being 21 years of age or older. Leo had been stationary on the motorcycle at a red light when approached by police. He made off at speed and subsequently lost control of the motorcycle, colliding with metal railings and sustaining injuries that caused his death.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. There is significant national concern about the “rental” of food delivery licences to under 18s. In general terms, food delivery platforms place age restrictions on those who can obtain a licence to deliver food. However, there appears to be no oversight of the rental of these licences to those under the age limit. This places children in a vulnerable position: lone working, often at night, riding electric or motorised scooters, mopeds or motorcycles and delivering to individuals that are not known to the drivers.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. There appears to be no or limited oversight of the practice of “renting” a food delivery licence to children under 18 years of age, which I heard is a national issue;
ii. As a consequence, children are working in the food delivery economy, which involves lone working at night, with deliveries being made to the home addresses of private individuals, placing the children in a vulnerable position;

The inquest conclusion was that Marcia Grant died on 5 April 2023 on Hemper Lane in Sheffield after suffering significant injuries sustained from a collision with a motor vehicle driven by her foster child. The circumstances which led to this incident were contributed to by the failings of the Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council to have appropriate systems and processes in place when placing foster children, including but not limited to the lack of accurate and complete documentation, failure to communicate risks and concerns appropriately, failure to conduct appropriate risk assessments and failing to safeguard those in their care.",Sadly on 5 April there was an incident where Child X took the Grants vehicle and when Mrs Grant positioned herself behind this to prevent him from leaving he reversed into her.

(2) Documentation and communication. Both the lack of documentation recording all the relevant risks, failure to complete forms and the lack of adequate communication of the risks in this matter led to a child being placed with a family where numerous individuals considered this was an inappropriate placement. Senior decision making was not based on all the appropriate information identifying there are inadequate systems and processes.
(3) Risk assessment. Evidence was heard about the risks posed by the child but no evidence that the risk to the foster carers or the other child in their care had been considered or assessed.

Access southwards to St James Road from Frederick Road is controlled by a STOP. Both roads are the subject of a 20mph speed limit Traffic Regulation Order.

2. Birmingham City Council stated that if a new junction being designed from new (i.e. it was not a pre-existing historic arrangement), they would oppose the use of a non-signalised crossroad junction because of the inherent confusion around priority of movement at the crossroad. However, this is a historic highway arrangement.

3. Whilst the road layout, including signage and road markings, complies with the legal requirements this does not appear to have mitigated against the prevalence of incidents at the stop junction.

4. There have been at least 27 other road traffic incidents at the same junction during the period 23 May 2014 to 8 March 2025.

5. The police investigator gave evidence that, in his experience, the number of collisions at the stop junction raises questions about the safety of the junction.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 July 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

On the evening of 5 July 2024 James Scott, aged 25, was driving southbound on the A33 when he lost control of the vehicle which turned sideways crossing onto the opposite carriageway colliding with a northbound vehicle. He sustained fatal injuries and was sadly pronounced deceased at the scene.","This report concerns a fatal road traffic collision between a Vauxhall Corsa and a Ford Ranger towing a SBS trailer upon which was a trailer, which occurred around 21:44 on Friday 5 July 2024 on the A33 near Kings Worthy, Hampshire.
Mr Scott was travelling south in his Vauxhall Corsa where the vehicle has passed through an area of standing water. Consequently, the Corsa has entered a state of clockwise yaw, passing through the central reserve and into the path of the oncoming Ford Ranger which was travelling north.
The Vauxhall and Ford have collided in 'T-bone’ formation, with Mr Scott sustaining fatal injuries and being sadly declared deceased at the scene.
On examination it was observed that two of the drains to the nearside of the southbound lane were compacted with vegetation, resulting in little or no surface drainage.
This is despite annual scheduled maintenance for year 2023/2024 taking place on 19 May 2023 and 15 November 2023. This included clearing gullies and catch pits either side of the A33.
A temporary “Flood” warning sign was located within the nearside grass verge, around 8 metres north of the commencement of the flooding.
The ‘temporary’ warning sign had been present for about 5 years prior to the collision.
Whilst ownership of the sign is subject to debate between National Highways and Hampshire County Council, the area is known to be a flood risk and has been one for several years prior to the collision.
The forensic examiner concluded that the standing water was a contributory factor in the collision and was relevant to factors affecting Mr Scott.","(1) The area is a known flood risk  
(2) Whilst the precise cause of the flooding is unknown, a more regular maintenance schedule may have prevented the buildup of vegetation within the gullies and therefore assisted in the drainage of the heavy rainfall experienced that day thus reducing the amount of surface water present on the road

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquests on 9 July 2025 in respect of Mr Reilly, and 11 July 2025 in respect of Miss Cox. The inquests found that Mr Reilly died as a result of multiple traumatic injuries, and Miss Cox died as a result of a traumatic head injury. The conclusion of both inquests was that both Mr Reilly and Miss Cox died in a road traffic collision.","On 1 April 2024, Mr Reilly was driving a Range Rover in company with his partner and her three children, one of whom was Miss Cox. They were driving along the M1 southbound, when approximately 1 mile before the exit slip road for junction 5 for Watford, Mr Reilly lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the vehicle leaving the carriageway to the nearside, through a gap in the safety barrier that runs along the nearside of the M1 and colliding with trees. As a result of the collision both Mr Reilly and Miss Cox sustained fatal traumatic injuries, and their deaths were confirmed at the scene.","I heard evidence that along this section of the M1 southbound there are safety barriers to the nearside of the carriageway. It was explained to me that if a vehicle loses control, the safety barrier is designed to prevent a vehicle from leaving the carriageway – the idea being that a vehicle that has lost control will continue along the safety barrier before coming to a more controlled stop, thereby minimising the risk of serious injury or death to passengers.

It was further explained to me that this is particularly important when a high-speed carriageway (such as a motorway) is lined with established trees, as is the case here. This is because any vehicle that has lost control and leaves the carriageway is likely to do so at high speed and collide with these established trees. This would likely lead to a very sharp and sudden deceleration, and may cause the vehicle to overturn, which significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury and death to passengers.

In this case, I was shown images of the collision scene which depict the presence of safety barriers shortly before and shortly after the collision site. Whilst I heard evidence that, in general, gaps are sometimes inserted into the safety barrier for the purposes of access or due to the presence of other safety measures (e.g. a grassed bank), the witnesses from the Roads Policing Unit could not offer any explanation for why there is a gap in the safety barrier at this location.

The car then collided with temporary plastic barriers which provided little or no resistance before hitting a further section of the road barrier comprised of posts and poles. The car then proceeded to hit a lamp post before coming to a stop in the road. Elizabeth sustained multiple traumatic injuries. Paramedics attended but her death was confirmed at the scene at 1057 hours. It is more likely than not that Elizabeth suffered a medical episode that led to her car initially colliding with the road barrier post and the gap in the road barrier enabled the car to then proceed to collide with road barrier posts and poles and the lamp post before coming to rest.","(1) The trajectory of Mrs Wagstaff’s car after the initial collision with the concrete post involved passing through temporary plastic barriers which, on the evidence heard, offered no resistance such that the car then proceeded to leave the road and collide with a lamp post before coming to rest back on the road.

(2) Upon examining photographs of the scene, the road barrier/railings and sections of the road, it was noted that plastic barriers similar to those referred to in the Record of Inquest above were present in another section of the A660 Leeds Road.

(3) Within the evidence adduced at the inquest, it was noted that Leeds City Council Highways Department have indicated that a schedule of works will be created with a view to replacing the old concrete and metal pole barriers with metal pedestrian railings in this area of the A660.

(4) The concern that I raise is that photographs considered at the inquest indicated the ongoing presence of plastic barriers in a gap in the existing barrier/railings elsewhere along the stretch of road.

See narrative conclusion","Mr Paul Ransom sadly died on 24 May 2023 on the A272 between Meon Hut and Petersfield, approaching the village of Langrish, Hampshire. A 40 mph speed limit applied. He lost control of his motorcycle whilst doing up to around 45 mph and crossed into the oncoming carriageway, colliding with a lorry and sustaining the multiple injuries that caused his death. Conditions were excellent: full daylight, sunny and dry. Surfacing work had been completed less than six hours before the collision. The surface was very slippery and this caused or at least substantially contributed to the collision.","The resurfacing that had been carried out was an asphalt preservation treatment known as a “thin surface treatment” wherein a bituminous solution is cold sprayed onto the surface, overlaid with a silicate grit. This is a commonly used method. I heard evidence that in the initial period after laying thin surface treatment has a particular property (“early life effects”) in dry conditions the level of friction available can be akin to that of a wet road. There is no guidance that signage be provided. There is also the potential for unpredictable vehicle behaviour, particularly at lower speeds or when road surface temperatures are high, by reason of a change in the level of friction available to a vehicle during a steering manoeuvre or braking. This may have a greater effect on motorcycles.

The newly applied surface looks like an ordinary tarmac road albeit pristine.

There has been research into accident rates following application of thin surface treatments. The research had the effect of allaying concerns but I was informed that the research may not have been able to look specifically at motorcycle accidents, and further informed that the issue of signage has been the subject of discussion in at least some highways authorities. Thin surface treatments are to be distinguished from surface dressing wherein aggregates are applied, following which loose chipping warning signs are usually erected and a reduced speed limit applied for the days following application.

Following thin surface treatment the drivers of vehicles, including motorcycles are likely to assume that in dry conditions the road surface is going to have the same properties as any established dry asphalt road surface.

I am concerned that where the road is, for example, downhill and/or twisting and/or with limited sight lines then it may be a particular problem if speeds are not adapted for the early life properties of thin surface treatments: particularly in the case of motorcycles.

The conclusion of the inquest was: Road traffic collision","In the early hours of 2 October 2023 Qasim was driving with a male and female in a BMW 123 M sport car LL09 XJF along Church Lane west bound when his vehicle was spotted by a police vehicle driving in the opposite direction. Due to the high speed of Qasim's car, the police officer decided to follow the BMW turning around and illuminating the blue lights. The police car drove along A4040 to obtain a full registration number and gain further intelligence on the vehicle and its occupants, reporting to the police control they were following the BMW.
Guided by the rear passenger Qasim turned onto College Road and Friary Road whilst the police car continued to proceed along A4040. Having lost sight of Qasim's vehicle the police vehicle got to the junction of Hollyhead Road and Island Road by Apple Green petrol station turned off blue lights and informed the police control room the vehicle was lost and they had stopped following the BMW. Due to the route Qasim had taken he now found himself behind the police car and was approaching Holyhead road junction where the police vehicle was stationary at traffic lights. Having spotted the police vehicle Qasim used the slip road to turn right onto Island Road. The police vehicle decided to return to Park Lane Police Station making two right turns onto Island Road. After a short period the police vehicle spotted Qasim's vehicle again travelling along Island Road West bound having completed a right hand turn using the cut out through in the central reservation. The police vehicle used the same cut through to follow Qasim's car it had not illuminated the blue lights to signal they wished the car to stop at this point as they had not been able to obtain the full registration number of the vehicle. Qasim again proceeded along Island Road and upon reaching the junction of Island Road and Hollyhead Road Qasim took a right turn to return along Island Road East Bound with the police vehicle approximately 8 seconds behind. At this point Qasim and the occupants of the vehicle were aware the police vehicle was behind them and Qasim accelerated quickly to gain distance between his vehicle and the police vehicle with the intention of abandoning the vehicle. As Qasim accelerated out of sight of the police vehicle along Island Road he failed to negotiate a left hand bend, losing control of the vehicle, mounting the grassed central reservation, hitting two trees before the vehicle came to rest on the road. The road conditions were damp but the weather was dry. Qasim had been ejected from the vehicle when it had hit the tree due to not wearing the driver's seat belt, he suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of the crash. The accident was caused by the speed Qasim was driving, his driving ability was impaired from driving from drinking alcohol and being 1.5 x over the drink drive limit and having smoked cannabis during the day. The way Qasim was driving had also been influenced by the presence of the police vehicle. Upon arriving at the crash scene the police vehicle illuminated its blue lights and attended to the occupants of the BMW. The police officer found Qasim on the central reservation and started to administer first aid. A second police vehicle arrived shortly after with one of the police officers assisting with advanced first aid to Qasim before the ambulance service arrived. Qasim was transported to the Queen Elizabeth hospital where he was examined and found that his injuries were unsurvivable. Qasim sadly died at 13:17 on 2 October 2023 due to a traumatic head injury.

Both had a different interpretation of when a spontaneous pursuit could occur as set out in the APP guidance. One force did not train officers who were standard drivers in relation to spontaneous pursuits as these were thought to be a type of pursuit and dependent on first satisfying the main definition of a pursuit under the APP guidance. The other force considered spontaneous pursuit to be a stand-alone type of pursuit and trained standard driving officers in relation to it. The confusion around what amounts to a spontaneous pursuit and when one can occur, and the difference in training of police standard drivers, creates a risk of future deaths and action should be taken.

2. For the IOPC: The IOPC were investigating the conduct of the police driver in this case. As a result of their investigation no full forensic collision investigation report was obtained.

It was later identified that the subject vehicle had struck a grassed mound of earth on the central reservation which interrupted the tarmac construction of the central reservation causing the vehicle in which the deceased was a passenger to become airborne.","The Forensic Collision Investigator advised that the aforementioned mound of earth creates a continuing hazard to motorway users and any vehicle which might have legitimate cause to veer to the central reservation and in doing so strikes the mound, even when travelling within the speed limit, would be subjected to the same effect on the vehicle (in that control of the vehicle would be lost) with potentially catastrophic effects.

Pinder,Rutland and North Leicestershire,Secretary of State for Transport,"On 28 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Patricia Heidi Bushell aged 56. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 May 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Mrs Bushell was a pillion passenger on a motorcycle being driven by her husband, when at just before 1.20pm on 9 September 2023 they were struck by a car which failed to stop at the junction on Stapleford Road and entered the carriageway of the A606. Mrs Bushell was thrown from the motorbike and came to rest on the road, sustaining fatal injuries. She was taken as an emergency to Queens Medical Centre Nottingham where she sadly died that same day.
There were multiple missed opportunities to identify a significant risk to road users during a period of resurfacing work. At the time of the collision, there was no advanced warning of white line removal at the junction and the permanent “Give Way” sign was not visible. As a result, the driver of the car which struck Mrs Bushell had not identified the junction and failed to stop.","The driver of a car which struck the motorbike on which Mrs Bushell was travelling, did not identify the junction ahead and was given very little opportunity to do so. The words “SLOW” were painted on the road 70 metres prior to the junction. There were permanent centre white lines/warning lines painted on the road commencing approximately 60 metres from the junction. Neither of these hazard warnings alerted the driver to the junction ahead. The topography gave the impression that the road continued ahead. A temporary sign with a red background and white writing displaying the words “No road markings at junction” was in situ at the junction and attached to the base of the permanent Give Way sign, this permanent sign was leaning over and obscured by foliage. The permanent white lines at the junction had all been removed including some of the centre/warning lines. There was inadequate signage on the road to assist the driver in identifying the approaching junction.

There is no evidence that the driver was distracted prior to the collision. He was using the Waze satellite navigation application on his phone and whilst I am not critical of its use or design, it contributed to the impression that there was no junction ahead.

There were multiple missed opportunities to identify that there was a significant risk to road users during a period of resurfacing work particularly from 4 September to 9 September 2023. Despite numerous dynamic risk assessments over these six days, it was not identified that the permanent Give Way sign was obscured by vegetation. No drive or walk through along the road had been conducted which would have afforded the four traffic marshals and their supervisor a driver's view of the junction and highlighted the associated risks.

A witness gave evidence on behalf of Leicestershire County Council (LCC) and accepted that they are responsible for the signage at this junction. LCC also accepted that there were missed opportunities to identify that the permanent Give Way sign was obscured. Reference was made to The Road Traffic Regulations and the Traffic Signs Manual and it remains the view of LCC that the single temporary sign in place on the road was appropriate and complied with the guidance.

It was accepted however that the processes that existed at the time of the collision required review and more robust and specific written risk assessments are now in place locally together with more comprehensive training for those involved in traffic management, using the circumstances of this collision as a learning and retraining exercise. Further suggestions made by the police in court including giving consideration to additional temporary warning signs well ahead of the junction, the introduction of a lower temporary speed limit and introduction of a drive or walk through of the approach to the area from a road users’ perspective and these will be included in a new written risk assessment.","I indicated at the conclusion of the inquest that I will not be making a report in respect of the missed opportunities identified in relation to Leicestershire County Council employees. Significant changes have been made. I am however concerned that in respect of the national regulations, I am told that the temporary signage installed at the collision site was compliant with the guidance. Reference was made to The Road Traffic Regulations and the Traffic Signs Manual and it remains the view of LCC that the single temporary sign in place on the road was appropriate and complied with the guidance. It was nevertheless inadequate.

I refer specifically to Chapter 16 paragraph 20 of the Coroners Bench Book, ""Where the identified risk to life has already been ameliorated by local changes the coroner may wish to consider whether the matter is an issue that only affects the relevant local organisation or is a wider or national issue. In the latter case then directing a report to a national, professional or regulatory body might enable them to also consider relevant changes that might protect lives.""

Griffin,Dorset,Secretary of State for Transport; Chief Executive Officer of Dorset Council,"On 12 December 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Charlotte Katie Mae Avis, born on 20 April 1992 who was aged 30 years at the time of her death.

The investigation was suspended under paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 on 16 April 2024 as I was notified an individual had appeared before Weymouth Magistrates Court having been charged with offences under the Road Traffic Act 1988 relating to her death.

Following the individual’s conviction and sentence, I held a hearing on 1 May 2025 where I determined that there was insufficient evidence to resume the inquest following the suspension.","At approximately 16.49 hours on 1 December 2022 Charlotte was driving her silver Ford Focus along the A30 dual carriageway in an easterly direction towards Sherborne, Dorset at the crossroad junction with Marl Lane, when her vehicle was struck head on by another vehicle that was being driven in the opposite direction which had lost control and crossed over into the opposite carriageway.

Marsh,Somerset,Somerset Foundation Trust; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; Royal College of General Practitioners; NHS England; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,"On 6 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Anne Potter, aged 54, (known as “Anne”).
The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 March 2025.
The conclusion of the jury inquest was a short form conclusion of Suicide in box 4.

The jury’s answer to ‘when, where and how’ was recorded in box 3 of the Record of Inquest as follows:

“Anne was a 54 year old menopausal woman experiencing a number of stresses in her life. The menopause contributed to her mental health decline and exacerbated her underlying anxiety.
On 27 September 2002, Anne took an overdose of paracetamol. She was taken to Yeovil District Hospital where she received treatment. She then received daily community mental health support.
After found wandering in traffic and absconding from her home, on 20 October 2022, she agreed to a voluntary admission to Rowan Ward. She was then detained on a section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. On 21 October 2022 this was upgraded to a section 2 detention.
On 24 October 2022, she was granted her first Section 17 Leave. On 31 October 2022, on a walk with a Health Care Assistant, Anne attempted to run into the road. On 16 November 2022, due to a number of incidents and no possible community support options, she was upgraded to a Section 3 detention.
During her review on 29 November 2022, Anne was authorised for Section 17 Leave for an overnight stay at home on 4 December 2022. On 3 December 2022 she had a day with her family in Bristol. On the morning of 4 December 2022, following staff assessment of Anne, the overnight leave was granted. Anne’s family did not receive appropriate information to assist them in keeping Anne safe for an overnight stay.
She went home on 4 December 2022 and in the morning of 5 December 2022 Anne used a key to open the back door, took a car key and drove away. Anne was driving on the eastbound carriageway of the A303 and at 07:48 she deliberately drove into the path of a HGV tank lorry on the opposite carriageway.”

The medical cause of death was recorded as:
Ia) Multiple traumatic injuries","Anne first presented to her GP in 2008. During this year she had three separate appointments relating to underlying anxiety and being unable to cope. There was no secondary mental health service involvement, nor was there any prescription of anti-depressants at this time.
Anne presented to the GP again in 2014, so six years later. Her presentation at this time was felt by the GP to be a grief/bereavement reaction.

From early 2017 up to the end of 2019 there were five separate consultations for gynaecological and/or gastroenterological presentations but despite secondary investigations, no underlying physiological cause was found and the GP felt that there was a high possibility that her tummy and bowel issues were related to her underlying anxiety.

On the 18 December 2020, Anne had her first significant consultation about mental health symptoms. She was extremely anxious and low in mood and stressed with life in general.
On the 11 January 2021 Anne was emotionally fragile, anxious and stressed. This was the first consultation at which menopause (or perimenopause) was mentioned. Given her presentation it would appear that her underlying anxiety had been slowly building; possibly since 2008 but much more so since 2017. Anne started taking Sertraline in February 2021 (she was prescribed this in the January but was too anxious about side effects to start taking it). She was also started on HRT.

By the end of May 2021 her symptoms appeared to be under control but it was impossible to know if this was the Sertraline, the HRT or a combination of both. In July of 2021, following consultation with her GP, the dose of Sertraline was titrated down so that by the autumn of 2021 she had stopped taking this medication altogether.

In early September 2022, Anne’s presentation declined again and she agreed to re-start Sertraline. On the 27 September 2022 Anne was at home with her husband when she informed him she’d taken [REDACTED] tablets. This was the first time Anne had done anything like this before and it was very much the start of her acute decline. After discharge from hospital she was seen daily by the mental health team, and declined an admission.

On the 20 October 2022, Anne did agree to a voluntary admission to an acute psychiatric unit. This was after she had been returned home by the police who responded to a member of the public who had called in after finding her wandering in traffic. Anne was detained under section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. She remained detained up till the date of her death; being placed on a Section 2 detention and this was upgraded to a Section 3 detention on the 16 November 2022.

Anne had a devoted and supportive husband and family, who were keen to be involved in her care and recovery; so much so that Anne started taking section 17 leave from the 24 October 2022 (3 days after she was detained). She would take escorted leave with either the staff or her husband in the local area for a couple of hours (gradually increasing up to 6 hours at a time).

On the 31 October 2022 whilst out with staff Anne ran into the road and was pulled back by the Health Care Assistant. It was never established what Anne was actually trying to do on this occasion; whether she was trying to harm herself or whether she was simply trying to avoid going back to the ward as she did not like the ward environment and had said that she would rather be at home with her husband. She remained on the ward without leave for three days after this incident.

On the 29 November 2022 an MDT (Multi Disciplinary Meeting) took place. At this meeting section 17 overnight leave was authorised for the 4 December 2022 on the basis that there had been no incidents of risky behaviour and/or absconding (with the exception of the 31 October 2022) and since that incident leave between the 4 and 29 November 2022 had gone ‘well’. Both Anne and her husband were keen for overnight leave and it was felt entirely appropriate to support this wish as part of her recovery.

Anne went out for 6 hours on the 3 December 2022 to a Christmas market in Bristol with her husband. This leave went well and without incident. Anne appeared brighter; she was showing future planning with her family for the forthcoming Christmas period and was commenting on finding pleasure and enjoyment in things again (the mental health team highlighted her enjoyment at watching Strictly Come Dancing which whilst small, highlighted a departure from her previous anhedonia).

Anne was assessed by a mental health nurse prior to her overnight leave on the 4 December 2022. There were no concerning or alarming features or presentation that would have given the nurse (or the entire mental health team involved in her care) any clinical reason to withhold her planned leave. The entire treating team were all very clear that there was no reason to not “let her out” that day. Her husband came to collect her at just after 10am that morning. He was not given any formal or codified ‘Risk Assessment’ document, but he had been very heavily involved in his wife’s care and treatment every step of the way and so the evidence was clear; even if he had been given such a document it would not have contained any information or details that wasn’t already within his knowledge.

Overnight the leave appeared to go well. Anne’s husband had locked the doors and windows and hidden those keys in a desk drawer. He did not hide the car keys as he did not think for one minute that his wife would take the car. That morning Anne found the back door key in the desk drawer and took the car. She was seen driving erratically by multiple other road users who were travelling eastbound on the A303 that morning. At around 07:48 Anne drove her car into the path of a fully laden HGV tanker travelling on the westbound carriageway. There was nothing the tanker driver could have done to avoid the collision. Anne died instantly of multiple traumatic injuries.

It came to light after Anne’s death that she had been using her own personal device (mobile or tablet) to access websites pertaining to self harm. It is unknown whether she had accessed the psychiatric unit’s wifi or whether she had made searches using her own personal data from her phone provider contract.","Part 1

(1) Anne was not sent home for her first overnight leave with any codified ‘Risk’ and ‘Safety Planning’ document. Whilst it was widely accepted in this case that Anne’s husband was well versed and knowledgeable about his wife’s risk and the measures that might be necessary to help keep her safe whilst she was at home, not all families are as involved in their loved one’s psychiatric care, despite the Trust following the Triangle of Care principles.

Whilst families are not mental health practitioners and are not expected to adopt that role within the community there appears to be an opportunity to supply families with a short, codified document dealing with salient points of risks and safety planning when a patient goes for their first overnight leave since being detained. This may equip families with the knowledge to spot signs of declining mental presentation and/or risk and provide them with the knowledge and/or tools to take appropriate steps to assist in safeguarding their loved ones whilst they are in the community.
This concern (and any action deemed appropriate by the recipients of this PFD) is not intended to override autonomy of the patient and their own ability/responsibility to keep themselves safe, but the concern centres around there being an opportunity to assist families in spotting early warning signs that ‘something is wrong’ and to seek help and intervention (if/when appropriate) to minimise the risk of a patient taking their own life whilst in the community.

(2) It transpired during the inquest that if an in-patient (detained or voluntary) accesses the secure unit Wi-Fi there are no algorithms or ‘search detection features’ to prevent access to websites pertaining to self harm and so these can be readily accessed by a group who are already vulnerable due to their acute mental health presentation with some element of inherent risk of suicide. It was noted, quite rightly, by legal representatives that workplace organisations can block access to certain sites they deem it undesirable for their workforce to access (such as sites relating to gambling, sexually inappropriate content etc) which shows that it is possible to limit access to certain websites and content when using a Wi-Fi provider. By allowing an already vulnerable group to have unfettered access to websites dedicated to self harm creates a risk of further deaths.

Part 2

(3) I am (and remain, having previously issued a PFD in a similar vein on 26 June 2024) concerned about the lack of ‘importance’ given to menopausal care available to women on the NHS; especially when compared to private sector meaning that women who are not fortunate enough to be able to access private clinics and facilities may not be able to access the services and expertise they need at a very crucial transitional phase in their lives. Menopause is not a lifestyle choice, it is an unavoidable part of a woman’s natural biological cycle. Without wishing to make sweeping generalisations, menopause is likely to affect 50% of the population at some point in their lives [according to Statistics Times, women made up 50.75% of the UK population in 2024].

I am concerned that:

(i) Certain elements of medicine and clinical practice training are compulsory but having heard evidence at the inquest around mandatory and statutory training modules I learnt that this covers areas such as GDPR training and disposal of sharp objects such as syringes. I was surprised to learn that menopausal training is not mandatory in any area of clinical practice or specialism. I am concerned that there is no requirement to undertake essential compulsory menopausal training for those working in ‘relevant’ clinical practices such as Mental Health Practice, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Oncology, or even as a general GP.

(ii) I was told that the Trust has just one ‘menopause specialist’ (a GP) who covers the entire Trust operations. Not all GP surgeries have a menopause specialist practitioner (or access to one) despite a GP usually being the first port of call for women in the community when seeking primary care. Those GP surgeries who do have a practitioner who acts as a ‘specialist’ is often a GP with a personal interest who has taken the initiative to go on courses and broaden their learning and understanding, rather than any mandatory requirement for a surgery [or group with multiple surgeries] to have an available community ‘front-line’ specialist.

I was told that the Trust does not have an “expert” in this field and it would be difficult to have one as menopause isn’t a disease or an illness. Whilst I do not dispute that it is not a disease, menopause is a condition; it does have symptoms and it does have recognised presentations, yet there appears to be a failure to recognise this condition as having equal importance to other ailments or diagnoses.

I was told during a previous PFD response relating to menopausal knowledge and care within the NHS that “It is important to ensure that women understand common symptoms such as anxiety, stress and depression which they might experience during the menopause and where and when to seek help. The NHS website has resources….” This emphasises my concerns entirely; the lack of importance given to menopausal symptoms. If someone has concerns about heart disease, a worrying lump, a broken bone etc they expect to be able to consult a medically qualified professional who has a knowledge and understanding of their condition or presentation and can diagnose and treat accordingly; not just [and I paraphrase] ‘have a look at a website to help’.

I appreciate that each and every woman will experience perimenopause and menopause differently, their individual experience is unique to them and this, to some degree, creates difficulties as a ‘one size fits all’ approach (which is perhaps achievable in other medical specialisms and disciplines) cannot be offered, but the lack of recognition of the importance of this condition remains a significant concern. I had previously been told (back in a 2024 PFD response) of a roll-out of specialist menopausal care and upskilling of GPs but there was little evidence during the inquest that this has happened/is happening and women continue to approach and navigate the menopause without the support of expert clinicians or practitioners who understand and can treat the symptoms they are experiencing.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,54,Female,Driver

Martin Robert Saunders, aged 48, died on A4059 New Road Mountain Ash, on 17 June 2023, which is a 60 mph road, with laybys and bends, locally described as a dangerous road. Martin’s motorbike collided with a coach which had been making a right turn from a layby / parking area. A sweeping bend approaching the layby reduces visibility for those approaching or exiting it. Martin’s motorbike was not visible to the driver when he began his manoeuvre and Martin’s reaction time when faced with the coach was further reduced because he had been overtaking other vehicles on the approach to the layby. Despite best resuscitation efforts, Martin was declared deceased at the scene.

Conclusion: Road Traffic Collision","The collision occurred on the A4059, New Road, Mountain Ash near the exit of a parking bay located on the east side of the carriageway. The parking area can be busy. At the time of the collision, the speed limit on the road was 60 mph and there was no prohibition on making right turns from the layby. The combination of reduced visibility due to the bends in the road, speed and right turns across the carriageway increases the risk of road traffic collisions.

Changes are in progress to reduce the maximum speed limit but even allowing for this, I remain concerned there is a risk of future deaths occurring along this route unless action is taken, due to vehicles turning right across the carriageway from the layby on this stretch of road.",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,48,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 April 2025, the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision","On 8 January 2023, Sheila Margaret Edwards was a front seat passenger in a car wearing a seatbelt. Shortly before the collision, the driver of the car was behaving slightly erratically slowing down when it was inappropriate to do so. As the car drove down Shawbridge Street, Clitheroe, the driver became unresponsive despite Sheila Edwards and another passenger shouting at him although he remained upright in his seat. The car accelerated to 50 mph. Sheila Edwards grasped the wheel and steered the car into the opposite carriageway to avoid stationary traffic. Unfortunately, this resulted in a head-on collision. After the collision it was noted that the driver was confused.","1. Dementia affects approximately half a million sufferers in the United Kingdom of which the DVLA has only been notified of approximately 30,000 drivers. It would appear that there is significant underreporting of drivers who may suffer from dementia

2. The current system for vehicle licensing relies upon the self-awareness of a driver and their ability to self-report medical conditions to the DVLA. A system that relies upon the self-awareness of a person applying for a driving licence to self-report a medical condition of dementia where the condition itself is characterised by a lack of self-awareness is inherently unsafe and exposes other road users to the risk of death or serious injury.

3. The UK population is of increasing age and the number of older drivers is increasing rapidly. As dementia is an age-related condition, the number of dementia sufferers in the population and in the driving population is expected to increase.

4. As a result of the way in which collision data is collected using Stats 19, there is a significant likelihood that dementia is under recorded in collision statistics. The nation this point regarding collision data regarding the visual aspect of collisions, the PFD report into the deaths of Mary Cunningham, Grace Foulds, Anne Ferguson and Peter Westwell should be consulted.

5. In this case, the driver suffered from focal epilepsy, which was the primary cause of the collision resulting Sheila Edwards' death. However, the memory deficit caused by dementia resulted in a lack of awareness of an underlying neurological condition. In such cases there is a substantial risk that neither of the conditions will be reported to the DVLA for monitoring. The result is that a driver with two conditions that should be monitored by the DVLA who is both unaware of their illnesses and the need to report themselves to the DVLA. This creates a substantial risk to other road users.",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,81,Female,Other

Adeley,Lancashire and Blackburn with Darwen,Secretary of State for Transport,"On 24 March 2022 I commenced an investigation into the deaths of:

Mary Frances Cunningham, aged 79 years whose investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 April 2025. The cause of death was multiple injuries and the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision;

Grace Foulds, aged 85 years whose investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 April 2025. The cause of death was multiple injuries and the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision;

Anne Elizabeth Ferguson aged 75 years whose investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 April 2025. The cause of death was multiple injuries and the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision; and

Peter Anthony Westwell aged 80 years whose investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 April 2025. The cause of death was spinal column chest injuries and the conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision;","The four fatalities shared the same feature that the driver’s sight was well below the standard required to drive a car with each driver had obtained a driving licence from the DVLA.

Anne Ferguson was killed by a driver who was unable to see was driving due to severe bilateral cataracts that had developed over the previous 8 to 12 years. During this time the driver had never sought an optical assessment. A month before the collision, the driver attended a visual assessment with an optometrist and informed her that he did not drive. Consequently, the optometrist did not tell the driver that he should immediately stop driving. The driver drove every day for the next month before colliding with Anne Ferguson causing her death. The driver input necessary to avoid the collision was minimal. There were no other contributory factors to the collision other than the driver’s very poor eyesight. The driver had repeatedly failed to self-report his condition, of which he was aware, on several licence applications to the DVLA. The DVLA, at the time of the collision, still licensed the driver to drive a car.

Mary Cunningham and Grace Foulds died in a double fatal due to a driver who was unable to see due to severe bilateral keratoconus. In 2019 the driver was informed that his sight did not meet the legal standards for driving, after which the driver got into his car and drove home. The driver underwent corneal grafting to his right eye after which, never having been informed by any clinician involved in his care that his vision met the legal standards for driving, he self-assessed that his vision in his right eye was now sufficient for him to drive. It would have been obvious that the driver that the vision in his right eye remained worse than his left eye, which even with the contact lens was insufficient to meet the legal standards for driving. There were no other contributory factors to the collision other than the driver’s very poor eyesight. The driver had repeatedly failed to self-report his condition, of which he was aware, as he considered that his obligation was only advisory rather than mandatory. The DVLA, at the time of the collision, still licensed the driver to drive a car.

Peter Westwell was killed by a driver who had a long history of severe bilateral eye disease. In 1999 the driver was only able to reach the visual standard required to drive using glasses. However, in all subsequent police interviews and statements he always denied the need for glasses. In 2003 the driver had a right retinal detachment resulting in the loss of almost all detailed vision in the central field. In 2013 the driver developed wet macular degeneration in his left eye resulting in significant compromise to his central field of vision and at this time this vision did not meet the legal standards for driving. The driver was told on two separate occasions that he should not drive before he began to inform optometrists that he was a non-driver. The driver had repeatedly failed to self-report his condition, of which he was aware, on multiple licence applications to the DVLA. The DVLA, at the time of the collision, still licensed the driver to drive a car.","1. The licensing system for class I drivers is the laxest in Europe for the following reasons:

• The UK is only one of five European countries to use a licence plate test (see below) for visual acuity testing
• The UK is only one of three countries to rely upon self-reporting of visual conditions affecting the ability to drive
• The UK is the only country to issue a driving licence without any visual check for a continuous period of time that may be as much as 53 years

A driver’s visual acuity is only checked at the time of the driving test by reading a number plate at 20 m. A driver may then hold a licence until 70 years of age during which time there is no check that they meet the visual legal standards to drive a car. During this time a driver is required to self-monitor and self-refer visual conditions to the DVLA. During this time a variety of ocular diseases may develop, some of which are silent and of which the driver may not be aware that they are suffering from a disease that would compromise the driver’s ability to comply with the legal standards to drive a car.

2. At 70 years of age and every three years thereafter, a driver self-reports on a licence application that they can read a number plate 20 m and have not been informed that their vision falls beneath the legal limit for driving. Over the age of 70 the incidence of diseases that affect the eye rises sharply and not all can be detected by the driver unless they undergo an ophthalmic assessment. There is no question of the renewal application as to whether or not the driver’s visual fields are sufficient to meet the legal standards for driving. Visual fields can only be assessed by an ophthalmic assessment using specialist equipment.

3. Self-reporting of visual conditions permits drivers to lie about their current driving status to those performing an ophthalmic assessment and avoid warnings not to drive. Drivers may also admit they drive but then ignore instructions not to drive and fail to notify the DVLA. In such circumstances, when the DVLA becomes aware, the DVLA does not refer such cases to the police for prosecution and consequently drivers can lie without sanction. All three drivers in this case either lied concerning the driving status, wilfully misinterpreted questions to avoid driving advice not to drive, adopted fictions of their visual performance to allow them to drive, prioritised their own enjoyment and independence over the lives of other road users and repeatedly obtained licences from the DVLA due to a defective self-reporting system that does not confirm the driver meets the visual legal standards for driving and is open to abuse.

4. Self-reporting of visual conditions affecting the driver’s ability to meet the legal standards required to drive a car is unfit for purpose for the following reasons:

• Surveys of optometrists in the UK have reported that over half of the optometrists reported seeing a patient in the last month who, despite being told their vision was beneath the driving standard, indicated they would continue to drive. This would suggest approximately 56,000 drivers a year undergo a sight test confirming they do not reach the visual legal threshold to drive a car but will continue to do so:
   • An independent survey of the public produced the following results:
      • 19% have had a collision either as a driver, passenger, pedestrian or cyclist with a motorist whom they believed had poor vision
      • 29% of motorists said they would continue to drive despite knowing their vision is below the legal standard
      • 33% of motorists would continue to drive as normal if a visual test showed their vision had fallen beneath the legal standard
      • 26% said they are concerned about someone they know driving despite having poor vision
• Doctor/optometrist-patient medical confidentiality is an entrenched aspect of UK medical practice and is only rarely breached and this only occurs after protracted patient negotiations during which time a driver continues to drive their car. Unless there were to be some form of requirement for a driver’s visual assessment that is below the legal limit to be communicated to the DVLA, this safeguard by which the DVLA may be notified of a driver continuing to drive against advice produces only a minimal number of cases each year. This is already known to the DVLA.
• Between 2019 and 2023 there has been a collapse of drivers self-reporting the four major conditions of diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration resulting in a 70 to 76% reduction in notifications. As the diseases are unchanged, the patient cohort is unchanged and the DVLA have not altered their processes, the DVLA have no explanation for this substantial reduction in driver self-reporting over such a short period. This was not attributed to Covid during the inquest. In view of the importance of retaining a licence, the ease of licence renewal by either online or postal methods and the length of time since the Covid epidemic, Covid would be an unlikely explanation of the collapse.
• Drivers who may have a degree of mild cognitive impairment or dementia may not be sufficiently self-aware to recognise visual deficiencies that compromise their ability to drive.
• The UK’s population is ageing with the number of drivers over the age of 70 increasing by approximately 250,000 drivers each year. As the changes to the eye and diseases that affect the eye predominantly affect those over 70, any existing problems will worsen in the medium term.

5. The 20 m licence plate test is a rough and ready roadside assessment of visual acuity. The 20 m licence plate test is unfit to accurately assess visual acuity to confirm that a driver meets the legal standard and makes no assessment of visual fields that are also a requirement. The European Council of Optometry and Optics in 2011 stated in respect of the 20 m licence plate test “this practice is unacceptable as the licence plate is not performed under control conditions and the results are not directly comparable with the underlying European standards which specify an assessment of visual acuity” and that member states using the licence plate test “should do more to improve their system of addressing drivers’ vision”. The UK took no action during the nine years it remained a member of the European Union.

The Association of Optometrists and the College of Optometrists both expressed the views of their organisation that the licence plate test was a poor proxy for a sight test both in terms of the information provided and the fact that it provided no visual health check to detect undiagnosed ocular and general diseases that may affect a driver’s ability to drive.

The Secretary of State for Transport already supports that drivers over the age of 60 should take advantage of the free NHS sight tests to ensure that their vision meets the legal standards for driving. However, research shows that drivers, for unspecified reasons, are not taking up these tests.

6. The latest government figures record 1,624 fatalities, 28,087 life changing serious injuries and 103,266 slight injuries accounting for 60,000 hospital admissions a year. Due to the Stats 19 data recording parameters, it is likely this is a substantial underestimate, the actual number of road collisions from the National Travel Survey being approximately 600,000 and from the Department of Work and Pensions Compensation Recovery Unit 446,976. Data collection is further complicated by historical IT issues between constabularies resulting in a non-standardised reporting software. According to the Department for Transport uncorrected defective eyesight only occurred in 56 of the 15,355 road deaths recorded between 1 January 2014 and 1 January 2023, or 0.224% of all deaths.

The evidence given at the inquest inferred that this figure was a significant underestimate of eyesight as a contributory factor in collisions for the following reasons:

• Other factors such as speed, wearing a seatbelt, using a mobile device or drink/drugs are easily ascertainable whereas defective vision is more difficult to detect, there must be a suspicion that it relates to an offence before a test can be made and the Stats 19 contributory factors usually are completed shortly after a collision when the full circumstances, including sight, may not be known
• The College of Optometrists stated that the visual aspects of collisions are difficult to disentangle from other contributory factors
• Different constabularies’ approach to roadside testing is substantial such that over the same 10 year period Essex Constabulary removed the licences from 350 drivers whereas Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Cleveland, Derbyshire, Durham, Gloucestershire, Gwent, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and West Mercia constabularies between them only removed the licences of 112 drivers
• The number of prosecutions for causing death by dangerous driving due to eyesight issues extrapolated from 34 constabularies give a figure of 95 deaths as opposed to the official figure of 56 for the same period
• Estimates of drivers continuing to drive with vision that does not meet the legal standards from safety initiatives and older driver safety experts range from 1.7% to 5%. This equates to an active driving population whose sight does not meet the legal limit of between 720,000 and 2.1 million licence holders.

Any assurances given by the Secretary of State should bear in mind the limitations of the government statistics in their reply.

7. During the course of the inquest the following observations were offered by various bodies regarding mandatory sight testing:

• The view of the National Police Chiefs’ Council was expressed by Commander [REDACTED] as that it was “much better not to let the risk (drivers with defective sight) onto the road and better for the police if the risk wasn’t there in the first place”. Commander [REDACTED] went on to express the view of the NPCC that they would “fully support mandatory sight tests, but this was a decision for those in government”
• The College of Optometrists clinical adviser explained that self-monitoring and self-referral was open to abuse by drivers who lie, the 20 m number plate test was both inadequate as a visual assessment of acuity and visual fields and that given the importance of the independence conferred by car driving there was considerable pressure on drivers to minimise any perceived visual deficits
• The Association of Optometrists explained that the current system was flawed and the DVLA should require proof of eyesight before granting a driving licence.

During the course of the inquest, it also became apparent that the Secretary of State for Transport has been forwarded two reports by the Older Drivers’ Task Force in 2016 and 2021 recommending mandatory sight testing. The Older Drivers’ Task Force is a body partly funded by the Department for Transport. The above information is provided to assist the Secretary of State for Transport and is not a recommendation by the Coroner to the Secretary of State.

8. The Secretary of State, prior to the commencement of the inquest, confirmed in writing that she endorsed the comments of previous Secretaries set out in previous replies to Prevent Future Deaths reports. In response to a PFD report concerning Louis Thorold, a five-year-old crushed to death by a driver with cognitive impairment, the then Secretary of State replied “I must stress that one road death is one too many and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is focused on ensuring that only those who meet the required medical standards are granted a licence”. For the reasons given above, the current system for “ensuring” drivers meet the visual legal standards is ineffective, unsafe and unfit to meet the needs of society as evidenced by the deaths of Mary Cunningham, Grace Foulds, and Ferguson and Peter Westwell where the DVLA continued to provide licences to drivers who had failed to meet the legal sight requirements.",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,79,Female,Pedestrian

Road Traffic Collision

The medical cause of death was recorded as:

1a Hypovolaemic shock with multiorgan failure

1b Massive internal haemorrhage from visceral injuries

1c Polytrauma from road traffic collisions

II Severe left ventricular hypertrophy with congestive cardiac failure","At about 06.19 hours on Wednesday 16 October 2024, the Deceased was driving his Smart car to work travelling coastbound on the M20 motorway in Kent. He was unaccompanied and travelling in lane 2 of the 3 lane carriageway. He was following a Vauxhall Mokka car (Mokka) also travelling in lane 2. The vehicles were at or about Junction 1 at the Swanley interchange.

The Deceased was travelling slightly faster than the Mokka vehicle and upon catching up with the Mokka. There was a collision between the front and front nearside of the Smart vehicle driven by the Deceased and the rear and rear offside of the Mokka. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate at speed. The Mokka was brought under control and stopped. The Smart car driven by the Deceased continued over the grass verge which separates the main carriageway of the M20 from the M25/M20, 2 carriageway slip road. The slip road carries traffic joining the M20 southbound from the M25 and is subject to the national speed limit of 70MPH.

On crossing the grass verge the Smart car driven by the Deceased entered the slip road and was in collision with a BMW vehicle travelling in lane 2 of the slip road intending to join the M20 Motorway coastbound. The Smart car then travelled further in the eastbound direction re-entering the M20 in lane 1, stopping partly in lane 1 and the hard shoulder. As a result of injuries sustained in the collisions Mr Slater sadly died at the scene.","(1) The grass verge which separates the M20 and M25/M20 slip road does not have erected upon it any physical barriers to prevent traffic crossing the verge from either of the two roads referred to and entering a parallel lane the opposite side of the verge.

(2) The evidence received from National Highways confirmed that under the present policy guidance, barriers would not normally be required as there are no features such as an incline on the slip road, bridge supports or trees requiring physical protection between the two merging roads of traffic travelling at similar speeds in the same direction.

(3) The facts of the present case illustrate that in the event of a loss of control of a vehicle travelling on either the M20 or in the slip road there is the potential for that vehicle, without any warning to drivers travelling at or about the same area in the coastbound direction, to cross the grass verge to their side and enter their lane of travel.

The investigation is ongoing at the present time but following a post-mortem a provisional cause of death has been established as being 1(a) blunt force head injuries.,"The circumstances of the death are as follows:

On 6 April 2024 the deceased was a pillion passenger on a motorcycle which was travelling in the direction of Nantwich along the A534. As the motorcycle approached the junction for Holt village, it collided with a motor vehicle which appears to have been exiting the junction. As a result of this collision the deceased sustained injuries which were incompatible with life and she was verified dead at the scene.","Following discussions with the Roads Traffic Policing Unit of North Wales Police, I am concerned that although at this location the A534 is a comparatively straight stretch road, the visibility from the junction when turning right out of the village in the direction of Wrexham may on occasions be obstructed by signage and/or by vehicles which are slowing to turn into the village.

Furthermore as this straight stretch of road is subject to a national speed limit following a 40 mph zone, traffic may be accelerating or travelling at speed, thus creating risk both for persons exiting the junction and traffic which is continuing along the main road.

It is also my understanding that there have been previous collisions in this vicinity in the past.

The conclusion of the inquest was as follows: On 1 February 2022 Benjamin Robert Compton died after being hit by a lorry on the M5, Devon, between junctions 29 and 28. Road traffic collision","Benjamin was diagnosed with having an autism spectrum disorder. In September 2021 Benjamin started to suffer a deterioration in his physical and mental wellbeing; according to the evidence this was probably due to an episode of swallowing water in a swimming pool; that event started a pathway of decline over several months. The evidence at the inquest supports the conclusion that the cause was multifactorial and there are a number of possible contributory factors to the deterioration in his health and the escalation in his disruptive behaviour, these included: aspects of his physical health, his medications, the removal from his GP practice, placement on the special allocation scheme, the lack of an effective medication review and changes in his routines. Benjamin required multidisciplinary input into all aspects of his care planning; including primary care for prescribing medication for emotional wellbeing and pain, from psychology for safe interventions, specialist sensory occupational therapy for communication and interaction with the world. In January 2022 when Benjamin was in crisis, clinical support and advice was limited – he was not able to see a GP, he did not receive a full and effective medication review and in the early part of January 2022 he was not in receipt of a full and effective social care package. The inquest heard evidence about the Devon Adult Autism Intervention Team (commissioned by the Devon Integrated Care Board and operated by Devon Partnership Trust). This team forms part of the Devon Health and Social Care Systems response to the needs of autistic adults across Devon, although it was not fully operational when Benjamin died. The team offers signposting and advice, consultation for professionals and assessment, formulation and provision of direct interventions where needed. This is a clinical team consisting of psychology, speech & language, occupational therapy and psychiatry. However the team is only able to offer limited interventions and not in circumstances where the individual is in crisis. In the early hours of 1 February 2022, at a time when he was distressed and overwhelmed by his emotions and difficulties tolerating change, Benjamin left his accommodation where he was being supported by carers and walked barefoot and in his night clothes to the M5 where he was hit by a lorry.","(1) The evidence reveals that there was a gap in the provision of care for individuals suffering with autism and in crisis, that remains the case today both in Devon and nationally. Evidence was heard that a gap exists with autistic people in distress and or dysregulation with no treatable mental health condition and there is a grey area around treatment. This is beyond the skills of social care providers. And unless the individual meets the criteria for treatment under the Mental Health Act there is very little support.

The investigations concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 January 2025. In relation to both deaths, I returned narrative conclusions as follows:

For Mr Butler – On 26 February 2022 whilst intoxicated, the deceased drove his vehicle in the wrong direction along the A55 at Broughton and into collision with an oncoming vehicle, sustaining unsurvivable injuries, and as a result he was verified dead at the scene.

For Mr Brett - On 26 February 2022 on the A55 at Broughton, the deceased was the driver of a motor vehicle which was struck by another vehicle which was being driven in the wrong direction on the carriageway by a person who was over the prescribed drink driving limit. As a result of the collision Sean Brett sustained injuries which were incompatible with life and was declared deceased at the scene.","On 12 February 2022, Carl Butler had been arrested, charged and bailed by Cheshire Constabulary in relation to a drink-drive offence.

At approximately 05:15 on 26 February 2022, Cheshire Constabulary received report of an intoxicated driver leaving a petrol station in Chester. (This was Mr Carl Butler driving a vehicle registered to him).

A report was put out requesting observations for this vehicle but the car and driver were not located.

At approximately 11:45 the same day, Cheshire Constabulary received a further report in relation to this vehicle and to the erratic manner in which it was being driven.

Around 30 minutes later, Mr Butler drove his car the wrong way along the A55 dual carriageway, colliding with Mr Brett’s vehicle coming in the opposite direction, resulting in both their deaths.

Subsequent tests established that Mr Butler was more than four and a half times the prescribed drink-drive limit at the time of the collision.","1. There was a confused picture of the management of the reports and information being handled by Cheshire Police insofar as a request for observations would be put out to officers by a communications operator, however there was no requirement for any officer to acknowledge that they had received such a request and therefore no means by which it could be confirmed that any actions were being undertaken as a result of the reports which had been received.

2. There was also confusion within the control room as to the methodology by which a vehicle could be added to an ANPR/Vehicle Finder System, and although an IOPC investigation was finalised in February 2023 which identified potential learning for the force in respect of ensuring control room staff understand the appropriate processes, evidence was heard at the inquest that a witness had not received this training until December 2024 due to a lack of time being made available to her to undertake the same.

Mr. Harris lost control of his vehicle and drifted across into the path of the oncoming vehicle due most likely to a medical condition.","• The medical condition of the deceased was known. He was known to have suffered blackouts and was also, in addition to a car driving licence, the holder of an HGV licence. The deceased had informed his own GP that he was no longer driving and had notified DVLA. Neither appear to have been correct. Additionally, in order to renew his HGV licence, the deceased completed a form DP4 on 19 August 2024 which was accompanied by a medical examination report of the same date.

• For whatever reason the deceased did not seek the medical report from his own GP, who would have known about his medical condition and who therefore would not have been able to support the application. Instead the deceased went to an independent GP and that GP completed the medical examination report based solely on what the deceased had told him (and without disclosing his medical condition) without having access to his medical records.

• A statement from DVLA relating to this inquest tells us that a driver is recommended to have their own GP complete the examination and the D4 medical report but there is no obligation on drivers to see their own GP.

• The concern is if a driver is prepared to provide inaccurate information to the DVLA there is nothing to prevent him doing the same to an independent GP who has no means of checking the accuracy of the information given to them. It then raises the question, what is the purpose and value of a driver being able to provide information to an independent GP who is not in a position to confirm its accuracy?

• In my view, consideration should be given as to whether a report from the driver’s own GP should be required or, if not, an independent GP should be able to have access to the medical records themselves.

Westcliffe Road has a 4.7% downward gradient on the southerly approach to a give way junction with Westgate. Angela, contrary to the instruction manual did not take the scooter off the free wheel drive by engaging the engine with her ignition key. As a consequence, she was unable to stop the scooter because the brakes could only be activated by engine engagement.

In addition upon 22 November 2023 I opened the inquest into the death of Tobias Crowther Barraclough, who at the date of his death was aged 18 years old. Their inquests were adjourned and both resumed and heard together and concluded by me on Tuesday 17 December 2024.

In the case of Joseph Samuel Walsh I found that the cause of death to be: -
1a Head injuries

In the case of Tobias Crowther Barraclough I found the cause of death to be:-
1a Severe traumatic and hypoxic brain injuries
1b Road traffic collision causing injuries to the brain face and chest

The conclusion of both inquests was road traffic collision","On 20/10/2023 Joseph Samuel Walsh was driving his motor car and carrying Tobias Crowther Barraclough along with 3 other passengers [REDACTED] (aged 18), [REDACTED] (aged 18), [REDACTED] (aged 18) and [REDACTED] (aged 17). All had been previously celebrating a birthday in a local public house and consumed alcohol. Joseph’s post mortem found that he had consumed both alcohol and cocaine, which would have placed him over the legal limit to drive. As Joseph drove the car along Brow Lane, Shelf, Halifax, a residential road with a 20mph speed limit, he lost control of the vehicle and collided with a wall, causing him to instantaneously sustain fatal injuries from which he died at 23:54.
Sadly, although Tobias was taken to hospital, he later succumbed and died from his injuries upon 12/11/2023.
The surviving passengers sustained injuries as a result of the collision.","• Joseph was aged 18 at the time of his death following the collision and had passed his driving test in 5/2023. This was five months prior to the collision. At the time of the collision, he was legally carrying 5 young friends.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 January 2025 and my conclusion as to the death was one of road traffic collision.","At approximately 22:45 hours on 24 March 2023, a fatal road traffic collision occurred on the A361 North Bar Street, Banbury, Oxfordshire. A red Nissan Pixo collided with a pedestrian, Anthony Paine, on the A361 North Bar Street, Banbury. Mr Paine was crossing the carriageway on a pedestrian crossing from right to left as viewed by the driver of the Nissan. The pedestrian crossing was controlled by traffic signals. Mr Paine did not wait to use the pedestrian controlled lights, having considered that the road was clear. He was struck by the vehicle and sadly died at the scene.","• The speed limit on the A361 North Bar Street at the location of the collision is 30 mph. There was a concern expressed at the Inquest that this speed limit may be too high, given the characteristics of the road and the volume of pedestrian traffic in the area.

• The A361 at this location is a long, straight, single carriageway with one lane in each direction. Travelling southbound, the pedestrian crossing is approached from a gradual rise in the road from Banbury Cross Roundabout, some 150 metres away. The rise in the road obscures the view of the pedestrian crossing to approaching vehicles.

• There are a number of pubs and restaurants on both sides of the road and a number of pedestrians in the area late into the evening.

• The Forensic Collision Investigator concluded that in the short window of time in which Mr. Paine was likely visible to the driver, they failed to see him. The Investigator’s evidence was that even if the driver had seen Mr. Paine, there would have been insufficient time to react and avoid the collision. However, the Investigator’s evidence also stated that if the vehicle had been travelling at a slower speed, this may have provided the driver with sufficient time to react and either avoid the collision or reduce the severity of the impact.

• In the opinion of the Forensic Collision Investigator, the speed of the driver’s vehicle was 32.6 mph ± 3.6 mph and was a contributing factor to the severity of the collision and that, as a general point, the slower the vehicle is travelling the less severe the effects of any impact.

Nigel had overtaken at least one vehicle and was attempting to overtake a second vehicle by using the additional lane of the creeper lane. There was steady and oncoming traffic on the other carriageway. Nigel had insufficient space in the creeper lane to safely complete the overtaking manoeuvre of the second vehicle. Nigel lost control of his motorcycle whilst under braking at which time he was likely trying to get back into the single carriageway at the end of the creeper lane. In that sense the creeper lane contributed to the collision.

Griffin,Dorset,Managing Director of Bournemouth International Airport Ltd; Chief Executive of BCP Council,"On 5 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Albert Nairn Lardner, aged 16 years. The investigation has not yet concluded, and the inquest has not yet been heard.","On the evening of 30 June 2023, William, known as Billy, had been working at one of the concessions at Bournemouth Airport. He finished work at approximately 9.30pm and walked from the airport main building, down Hurn Court Lane, the road upon which the airport is situated, towards the traffic lights on Parley Lane, Christchurch, the main road outside the airport. Billy’s brother had arranged to collect Billy from work that evening. At approximately 9.34pm Billy was crossing Parley Lane at the traffic lights, at the junction with Hurn Court Lane, towards his brother’s car which had stopped at the lights when he was struck by a vehicle which had gone through a red light at speed. He sustained significant, traumatic injuries which led to his death.","(1) Bournemouth International Airport is a busy passenger airport with daily flights operating from the airport. A recent article on the airport’s website on 25 November 2024 marked their one millionth passenger for 2024. This article reports a rise in passenger numbers and plans for anticipated future growth with a series of new routes.

(2) Passengers using Bournemouth Airport can access the airport by car, whether that is a private vehicle or a taxi. There is airport parking available for 2250 passengers and 213 staff. There is a drop off area. The minimum charge to access the airport drop off zone is £5 for 30 minutes, which is said to be standard airport industry practice.

(3) There is limited access to the airport by public transport. There is no access by train and there is one bus service from central Bournemouth to the airport. This bus service only operates Monday to Friday with a total of 5 journeys a day: 2 inbound journeys which are from Westover Road, Bournemouth to the airport, one between 05:50 and 06:31 hours and then the other between 06:35 to 07:22 hours and 3 outbound journeys from Bournemouth Airport to Westover Road, Bournemouth between 13:53 to 14:25 hours, 16:20 and 17:20 hours and 18:00 to 18:49 hours. This service focuses on providing a service for staff working at the neighbouring Aviation Business Park, however, does also serve the main passenger terminal. Previously, the airport was served by an hourly bus service, however this was stopped.

(4) Many people access the airport on foot, either being dropped off and/or picked up on Parley Lane where there is no layby or drop off zone or by using nearby car parks and walking on foot to the airport. One such car park is at the Adventure Wonderland site and is known as Parley Lane Parking (Parley Lane Parking | Bournemouth Airport Parking). This is 0.9 miles from the airport, on the opposite side of Parley Lane which offers cheaper rates than Bournemouth Airport to park. There is no pathway on the side of the road at Parley Lane Parking and no crossing facility, so people will either walk along the road or have to cross the road to access the footpath. Please see attached photograph at JGL/5.

(5) Parley Lane is a busy single carriageway semi-rural road with a national speed limit and BCP Council has responsibility for the road as the local highway authority. Hurn Court Lane is owned by the airport who therefore have responsibility for it. There is no public footpath along Hurn Court Lane after turning off Parley Lane to access the airport. Please see attached photograph at JGL/4. This results in pedestrians walking in the road or on the grass section next to the road on Hurn Court Lane to get to the airport terminal. This is dangerous as it is not a stable, safe public pathway and could lead to people falling into the road or being struck by vehicles, especially as people pull suitcases along. The airport has erected signs stating there is no pedestrian access, however, these are widely ignored.

(6) A site visit and assessment in July 2023 by Dorset Police Road Casualty Reduction Officer and the Senior BCP Council Safety Officer following Billy’s death highlighted some fundamental safety issues. At this time no action has been taken around these safety issues, although matters have been discussed. Accordingly, the safety issues remain the same 17 months on from the site assessment, with a likely increasing number of passengers using the airport going forward.

(7) I, therefore, have concerns that there could be future deaths given the manner in which users are accessing the airport and the lack of public transport and pedestrian access available.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,16,Male,Pedestrian

Harris,East Riding of Yorkshire and Kingston-upon-Hull,"Traffic Services, Hull City Council; National Highways – For area of Kingston upon Hull","On 19 December 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gary Stephen DUNN, aged 47 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 2 December 2024.

The conclusion of the inquest was:
Road Traffic Incident

The following findings of fact were made:
• Lorry White Volvo LGV registration H4 LGE
• Mr Dunn was riding a bicycle.
• Neither vehicle had any defects.
• No weather conditions were contributory to the incident.
• There was no defect in the road that was contributory to the incident.
• I do acknowledge that the road had changed its markings, this was a relatively recent change.
• I acknowledge that there was an alternative route for Mr Dunn to navigate the busy roundabout, however Mr Dunn was within his rights to use the road.
• The issue of whether Mr DUNN was visible at any time was an issue at inquest. The driver of the LGV could not recall specifics about his mirror checks but stated a number of times that it was instinctive, constant thing, something that he does all the time. He was open about the fact that he did not see Mr DUNN at any time. I do find his evidence credible.
• When Mr Dunn is in a position where he could be started to be regarded as visible, he is approximately 70 metres from the roundabout. I accept there was an opportunity for the LGV to see Mr Dunn and recognise him as a road user, but I also recognise that for the majority of the time Mr DUNN was in the inside lane, there were other vehicles on the road and the driver of the LGV would have also been looking to negotiate the roundabout.
• Mr Dunn did have lights on his bike but he was not wearing any clothing that would make him more visible. As stated previously, the driver of the LGV reported that at no time did he see him. At the time that the presence of Mr DUNN would have indicated a risk, he would have been in the blind spot of the LGV, high visibility clothing at that stage would not have made a difference.
• This is relevant when at the give way line, albeit for a short period of time, Mr Dunn was positioned in the LGV driver’s blind spot before both move to negotiate the roundabout.
• The 1st lane of the roundabout is marked for those to leave the roundabout at the first junction. The 2nd lane of the roundabout allows users to both leave the roundabout at the 1st junction and also continue travelling forward on the roundabout.
• As the vehicles leave the give way line, the LGV is indicating to take the first junction. Mr Dunn was positioned very close to the cab. It would not be possible to say whether he noticed the indicator.
• As both the LGV and Mr Dunn leave the roundabout, they are both positioned in lanes that allow exit via the first junction. Mr Dunn is, however, not visible to the LGV driver. Mr Dunn is straddling both the 1st and 2nd lane and is going to travel straight over the roundabout.
• CCTV shows that as the LGV manoeuvres to take its exit, Mr Dunn rides across its front directly in its path. I note that the lorry does not cross the bicycle's path, it does not leave its lane. It is evident that Mr Dunn does not appreciate that the vehicle was indicating to turn left at the 1st junction. At the time that the LGV takes its junction Mr Dunn may have been trying either to cycle quickly to out-manoeuvre the vehicle, or attempting to cut across the front of the LGV to reach the next junction, however the CCTV seems to indicate he simply does not appreciate the lorry is turning left and he carries on his route which takes him in front of the LGV. It was a quick misjudgement, with very tragic consequences.
• At the time the bicycle crosses its path, there was nothing that the driver of the LGV could do to avoid the collision.
• I find the LGV stopped appropriately. For the avoidance of doubt, I accept the evidence that the tachograph did not show that this slowing was in an attempt to avoid the accident.
• I do note that Mr DUNN was not wearing a cycling helmet, however given the gravity of his injuries, this piece of equipment would not have saved his life.
• Mr DUNN’s death was instantaneous.
• Toxicology revealed previous exposure to cocaine and tramadol in his system, but no evidence of acute toxicity.
• I note that the dashcam was not seized immediately, and then there was a discrepancy over who seized it. I accept that one officer seized the LGV and the dashcam together but another then seized the dashcam itself. I note that the override on the dashcam was continuous even when the engine was running, and as such there was no dashcam footage. I appreciate that when officers attend these scenes there are many tasks and priorities, but it is regrettable that this footage was not seized immediately. This is something that could have given comfort to the family. However we do have the CCTV footage and while it does not give a view from the cab it does provide a record of the incident.
• I will be making a RPFD to highlight the officers' concerns over signage.

Box 3 of the record of inquest read:
On 8 December 2023 Gary Stephen DUNN was riding his pedal cycle to college. At the Stoneferry Road/Ferry Lane roundabout, Kingston Upon Hull Mr DUNN’s bicycle collided with a Light Goods Vehicle. Mr DUNN was killed instantly.

His medical cause of death was recorded as:
1a Severe Head Injuries
1b Road Traffic Incident","Gary Stephen Dunn, aged 47 years, was cycling to college. En route he had to negotiate the Stoneferry Road/Ferry Lane roundabout in Kingston Upon Hull. Evidence was heard that the layout of the road had changed recently, whereby the centre lane could now also be utilised to turn left. An LGV was in this lane and indicating to turn left. Mr Dunn was intending to travel over the roundabout and was on the nearside of the LGV. The driver of the LGV said at no time did he see Mr Dunn. Mr Dunn attempted to travel towards his exit but rode into the path of the LGV as it turned left. He died instantly.","1. I appreciate it has been almost a year before this inquest was concluded so the change in road layout may now be more known to regular drivers, however people unfamiliar with the road may also need to navigate the roundabout. The Officer in the Case, an experienced Serious Collision Investigation Officer, raised concerns regarding the signage of two aspects of this area of road:
• Firstly, although the road markings which indicate the centre lane can also be used for left hand turning vehicles was regarded as clear, the officer felt there was insufficient actual road signage to assist road users in how the roundabout can be navigated. This was of particular concern as this is a busy roundabout with a build up of traffic and so markings on the road are often obscured.
• Secondly, there is a dual use path for both pedestrians and cyclists as well as the availability of a Toucan Crossing. This provides cyclists with an alternative to using the road. Again, evidence was heard that there was inappropriate signage to instruct cyclists that this route was available.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,47,Male,Cyclist

Nieto,Derby and Derbyshire,The Secretary of State for Transport; Driving Standards Agency (DVSA); The National Farmers Union; The Agricultural Engineers Association; The British Agricultural and Garden Machinery Association; The Health and Safety Executive,On 31 July 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Jon-Paul Prigent aged 47. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 November 2024.,"Jon died on 30 July 2020 at Station Lane Old Whittington near Chesterfield, due to a trailer containing soil overturning on to the car he was in. Jon was sitting in the passenger seat preparing to give a driving lesson to his daughter. The trailer had decoupled from the tractor it was hitched to, and the trailer descended down the hill hitting a wall which caused it to overturn. The weight of the trailer put Jon into a compressed position and led to asphyxiation. The tractor and trailer belonged to and was used by a skip hire company. On 30 July they were being used to transport soil from the business premises and yard to the family home for use on land surrounding the property. The journey was along Station Lane, a public highway. The trailer decoupled from the tractor as the tractor went over a speed bump. That section of Station Lane is also on a hill.

On the evidence the decoupling probably occurred due to a combination of factors: -

- Wear of the coupling components: the towing hook, the hitch ring was worn to below its minimum thickness, and there was a gap between the location of the tip of the towing hook and the keeper plate.

- The trailer was overloaded. It was manufactured for a maximum load of ten tonnes but the soil it was loaded with weighed thirteen point eight tonnes.

- The soil was unevenly distributed and weighted more to the rear of the trailer adversely affecting the trailer’s centre of gravity.

- As the hitch coupling passed over the speed bump a bigger gap opened up for the hitch ring to pass between the tow hook and keeper plate.

- On inspection after the incident it was noted that the tip of the tow hook was missing. Whether it had been missing before the decoupling or was sheared-off during the decoupling cannot be established.

- The owner and user of the tractor and trailer was required to check their roadworthiness including the hitch and coupling components before each day of use. It is unlikely that a check that day, or recent checks, had been adequate because had those checks been good enough, the degree of component wear would have been noted, and appropriate corrective measures should have been taken. Independent professional vehicle testing is not legally required for tractors and trailers used for agricultural purposes. The driver of the tractor stated that had he seen the degree of wear on the components he would not have taken the tractor trailer on to the road on 30 July.

- The tractor and trailer did not have safety features to prevent decoupling because legislation does not require these for tractors which are driven at below twenty-five miles per hour.","1. Tractors and trailers driven on roads for ‘agricultural purposes’ are not subject to periodic independent vehicle testing. This places the responsibility for checking roadworthiness on the user which is clearly dependent on the diligence and competence of the user. It is therefore highly likely that some tractors and trailers are being driven on roads for ‘agricultural purposes’ in unroadworthy and unsafe condition, as was clear in Mr Prigent’s inquest.

2. Tractors and trailers driven on roads at below a speed of 25 miles per hour are not required to be fitted with safety features to prevent decoupling (e.g. a safety chain, or dual safe braking system). Therefore, if decoupling occurs there is nothing to prevent independent and uncontrolled travel of the trailer.

3. Basic hitch hook and ring coupling systems for tractors and trailers are very simple and convenient for ease and speed of coupling and use on farms but present clear risk when used on public roads without safety features to prevent decoupling.

4. Tractors and trailers are increasingly large and carrying heavier loads due to farm consolidation and are correspondingly travelling further distances on public roads to reach more distant areas on larger farms, and agri-business depots and processing sites. The current safety arrangements have probably failed to keep up to date and relevant and were more suited to an era when agricultural use tractors and trailers might simply have been crossing a road to get from one field to another.

5. At inquest I heard expert evidence on the above points, and that other nations, particularly in the European Union, have introduced comparatively robust legislation regarding testing and safety measures/fittings.

6. At inquest I heard evidence that the fitting of safety features to prevent decoupling is relatively low cost and that there have been previous voluntary schemes to encourage and incentivise these measures.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,47,Male,Other

Lane,"County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay","Chief Executive, Plymouth City Council","On 17 January 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Jay Stuart Whiting. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest hearing on 14 November 2024 at Exeter Coroner’s Court, in the County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay Coroner Area. A short-form conclusion of ‘road traffic collision’ was determined.","Jay Whiting was only 21 years old when he was fatally injured in a single-vehicle road traffic collision in Plymouth on 7 January 2023.

Following medical evidence heard at the inquest, the cause of death was determined in Section 2 of the Record of Inquest as:

1a – head injury
1b – road traffic collision

Section 3 of the Record of Inquest (which answered how, when and where Jay Whiting came by his death) was determined as follows:

‘Jay Whiting was the sole occupant of a vehicle registered to him when he was driving northbound on Embankment Road, Plymouth, in the early hours on 7 January 2023. Jay lost control, and was then unable to regain control, of the vehicle, owing to a number of relevant factors, including very wet weather and significant water collection on the road, the poor condition of the vehicle’s rear tyres and the reclined position of the driver’s seat. Jay’s vehicle left the road and hit a mature tree, which was situated on the pavement adjacent to the carriageway. The collision of the vehicle with the tree resulted in Jay suffering fatal injuries. Despite initial resuscitation by attending paramedics and transport to Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, Jay died there in the neuro-intensive care unit later on 7 January 2023.’","Although the determinations at the inquest found there to be a number of relevant factors which contributed to the fatal road traffic collision and, therefore, to Jay Whiting’s death (as set out in paragraph 4, above), one such contributing factor was that the vehicle being driven by Jay Whiting left the road and immediately collided with a mature tree (one of many such trees which line Embankment Road, Plymouth). Embankment Road (or at least this particular stretch) is a dual carriageway and a main route into the city centre of Plymouth.

As part of the investigation and inquest process, photos were taken of the scene by forensic collision investigating officers, and these showed the large trees to be adjacent to the dual carriageway, situated on a pavement only a matter of inches from the kerb. It is clear from these photos that, firstly, any vehicle that, in whatever situation, has cause to leave the road and mount the kerb is very likely to immediately collide with one of the mature trees and, secondly, the size of the trees (the circumference of their trunks) make it difficult for pedestrians, or those using mobility aides, to safely walk/move along the pavement without having to step into the road.

Evidence was heard at the inquest from Motor Police Constable [REDACTED] road casualty reduction officer for the Plymouth area (employed by Devon and Cornwall Police). MPC [REDACTED]’s unequivocal opinion was that the presence of these mature trees at this location (both on the northbound and southbound carriageways on Embankment Road, but particularly the stretch of trees at the location of this fatal incident on the northbound carriageway) is frankly dangerous from a road safety perspective. MPC [REDACTED] stated that, in addition to this fatal accident in 2023, there was a fatal accident in 2008, where a vehicle collided with one of the trees along the same stretch of the northbound carriageway, resulting in the deaths of two occupants of the vehicle. MPC [REDACTED] was therefore concerned that there had been three deaths arising in very similar circumstances at the same location, involving trauma brought about by vehicular collision with one of the mature trees. MPC [REDACTED] stated that he was not aware of any other location in Plymouth where trees lining the road had been considered a contributory factor in a fatal vehicle collision. Owing to these concerns, MPC [REDACTED] made a request that consideration is given by Plymouth City Council to removing the trees at this location.

Evidence was also heard at the inquest from [REDACTED] senior traffic engineer for street services (employed by Plymouth City Council). [REDACTED] stated that he was aware of the concerns held by Devon and Cornwall Police regarding the mature trees and that, personally, he would also like the trees to be removed. [REDACTED] stated that the removal of trees in Plymouth was currently ‘a political topic’ and, for the trees on Embankment Road to be removed, a decision would need to be taken justifying the use of scarce local authority public funding. [REDACTED] accepted that there had, thus far, been no formal risk assessment or evaluation carried out by Plymouth City Council as to whether the safety concerns identified warranted resources being used to remove the trees. [REDACTED] further accepted that this process should now take place and that he had been waiting for the outcome of this inquest before deciding upon appropriate next steps.

Owing to there being clear safety concerns regarding the continued presence of these mature trees on Embankment Road, Plymouth, in my view these need to be formally considered (it is for Plymouth City Council to consider issues of risk and cost/benefit analysis of any proposed action/inaction) with a view to determining what, if anything, should happen to the trees.",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,21,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 November 2024.","On Wednesday 14 June 2023 Dorothy Nias was driving an automatic transmission vehicle owned by her since April 2017. She was driving downhill on a dual carriageway section of road on the A39 at Devoran, Truro approaching a roundabout with a speed restriction of 50mph. On approach she moved into lane 2 continuing at speed before mounting the roundabout, travelling across to the other side where she hit a lamp post causing her vehicle to rotate and land in the opposite direction of travel. The lamp post then fell but did not cause any further injury or incident. Miss Nias later stated that she had confused her brake and accelerator pedals and, in an attempt to prevent hitting the vehicles in front of her in lane 1, she moved to lane 2. There was no evidence of any vehicle defect. There were no other vehicles involved and no evidence of any other feature that caused or contributed to the collision. It was a dry and fine day. As a result of the collision she sustained multiple injuries and did not regain her mobility with a gradual deterioration in her condition. She died on 6 November 2023.","It was clear from the evidence that there were concerns raised by family members to Miss Nias regarding her ability to continue to drive having had a number of minor incidents prior to this collision. Despite encouragement to use alternative means of transport she was described as independent and chose to continue. The accident was caused by confusion between her brake and accelerator pedals in an automatic transmission vehicle, allowing her speed to increase without restriction and as a result she was unable to negotiate the roundabout leading to the collision.

1a Pulmonary embolism
1b Brain and multiple traumatic injuries","Mr Gillard on 11 September 2022 was crossing a three-lane carriageway on the A4 Great West Road near the junction with Jersey Road, in Hounslow, using the appropriate pedestrian crossing which is a crossing with no pedestrian traffic lights. Mr Gillard crossed the road at a time he considered safe to do so and whilst doing so, the traffic lights turned green in favour of the cars whilst Mr Gillard was still in the road trying to complete the crossing. Mr Gillard collided with a moving vehicle and suffered brain and multiple traumatic injuries which led to a pulmonary embolism from which he died on 18 September 2022 in hospital.

The A4 Great West Road, is located in West London and it is orientated along an east-west axis. The collision occurred on the west bound carriageway of the A4, at the pedestrian crossing located immediately to the west of the junction with Jersey Road (south).","The A4 Great West Road is a major route for vehicles of all types travelling in and out of west London.

It has three lanes in both directions, separated by a raised central kerb. This crossing point also leads pedestrians into the cycling lane.

I understand that at no point during the normal use of the traffic light controlled junction does traffic cease to flow at the marked crossing area, making it difficult for pedestrians to judge when and from where the next vehicle would approach. This means that pedestrians will need to use their own judgement as to when it is safe to cross this road without the aid of pedestrian traffic lights.

I received evidence that there have been other accidents involving pedestrians and moving vehicles at this pedestrian crossing in the past.

I received evidence from the TFL of existing plans to re-design this pedestrian crossing to improve pedestrian safety.

Narrative: The death of Alice Olivia Clark was due to a road traffic accident but that there was a failure by the South East Coast Ambulance Service in their investigation of complaints they had received from other members of their staff over the driving of [REDACTED] where if it had been acted upon could have changed the outcome.","At 20.16 hours on Wednesday 5 January 2022, a road traffic collision involving a SECAMB ambulance was reported to Kent Police on the A21, coastbound at Tonbridge. From the information known at the time of writing, it would appear that a marked SECAMB ambulance (Vehicle 1) was being driven by [REDACTED] to an emergency call on blue lights, when for reasons currently unknown, the vehicle has taken the slip road towards the layby (where the collision occurred) instead of the next exit, which goes off the A21 towards the Morley's Road roundabout / A225.

Upon entering the layby, the ambulance has collided with the offside kerb, then rear nearside of a stationary and attended Scania dropside lorry which was parked to the offside of the layby, the force of which has caused the ambulance to cross the layby to the nearside, where it has then collided with the rear of a stationary and attended Volvo tanker cement lorry.
The impact caused the ambulance to become embedded into the rear of the tanker, trapping both the driver and front seat passenger (Miss Alice CLARK) within the vehicle. A third occupant, [REDACTED] was seated in the rear of the ambulance. [REDACTED] was able to exit the ambulance with assistance however suffered severe concussion and possible bleed on her skull.
Miss CLARK was extricated from the front of the ambulance by KFRS and HEMS attended.

Davies,Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly,Principal Transport Officer (Road Safety) Cornwall Council,"On 1 August 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of 49-year-old James Edward Turner. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 2 September 2024.

The medical cause of death was found as follows:

1a Head and chest injuries

The four questions - who, when, where and how – were answered as follows:

James Edward Turner died on 25 July 2023 on the B3252 southeast of Liskeard Cornwall, from trauma when the motorbike he was riding collided with the offside of a twin axle trailer, laden with grain, that was being towed by a tractor across the B3252 from a field into the Fursdon Farm entrance opposite the field.

The conclusion of the inquest was as follows:

Road traffic collision","James died whilst riding his Kawasaki 1000cc motorcycle in a south-easterly direction on the B3252.

The B3252 at the point of the collision is a single carriageway and is subject to the national speed limit which is 60 miles per hour (mph) for the Kawasaki.

James collided with the offside of a twin axle trailer that was being towed by a tractor. The trailer was laden with grain and being towed across the B3252 from a field opposite the junction of Fursdon Farm.

The trailer had effectively blocked the road down which James had been riding. Forensic evidence indicated that James was braking until the moment before impact. James appears to have maintained the Kawasaki in an upright position whilst braking which implies rider input right up until the point of impact.

James was killed instantly, and his motorcycle caught fire shortly after impact.

The court found that James was riding at excessive speed in the period immediately before the collision and that it is likely that James’ excessive speed has contributed to this collision.

The police conducted a visibility study using the same tractor and laden trailer involved in the collision together with an unmarked police motorcycle, which revealed the following:

• The rider of the police motorcycle, when positioned towards the centre of the road, recognised something at the field entrance at a distance of 159.6m from the entrance, and was able to identify it as a tractor at 132.6m.

• The tractor driver identified the motorcycle between 86.7m and 100.1m depending upon the motorcyclist’s position within the width of the road. 86.7m when the rider was close to the road edge and 100.1m when he was nearer towards the centre hazard white line.

• From a stationary position with the front of the tractor level with the entrance to the field, it took approximately 15 seconds for the tractor and trailer to emerge from the field and enter the farm entrance, completely clearing the road.

Calculations indicate that at a speed of up to 64mph, even with a response time of 2.5 seconds, James would still have been able to stop even if he only identified the tractor at the latest point when it could be identified as a tractor.

The court noted that at 60mph it would take 4 seconds for a road user to cover the 100m visibility that the tractor driver has at the centre hazard white line. On the basis of this study the court found that visibility at the site of the collision was limited for tractor drivers emerging from the field.

Furthermore, the court heard evidence of recent road traffic data that some motorists are speeding at that location.","(1) Road safety at the location of the collision taking account of

• the speed limit at the location,
• the limited visibility for tractor drivers,
• the nature of the tractor loads being conveyed at the collision site and the time it takes for combinations to cross the road,

The circumstances of the death were that on 19 February 2023 the Tollett family attended Plymstock Albion Rugby Football Club to watch their eldest son play in a friendly training match against Exmouth RFC. The weather was dry and bright with clear blue skies.

The club car park was full and club parking attendants were turning cars away.

(2) There were a number of errors that were made by the driver which caused or contributed to the death. These were

• Wrongly placing the car in drive instead of reverse

• Failing to look down at the camera and pressing the button to move forward by touch alone

• Failing to realise that the reversing warning sound which was said to be very difficult to hear inside the car was not engaged

• Driving forward and continuing to do so for 8-10 seconds after the accelerator was pressed

• Failing to press the brake at any time.

(3) However, these errors occurred as a result of there being no intermediary step within the Jaguar I-PACE being necessary to put the car into drive/reverse other than pressing a button. In the police officer’s opinion if there had also been a lever or something similar present in the vehicle that needed to be engaged before a button was pressed this may have alerted [REDACTED] to the fact that he had pushed the incorrect button on the 3 button console.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,7,Male,Pedestrian

CCTV monitoring of driver behaviour was commenced. Police activity and monitoring by National Highways showed that despite these measures, drivers were still turning early and attempting to drive the wrong way down the slip road.

Swift,East Riding of Yorkshire and Kingston-upon-Hull,Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA),"On 8 August 2019 an inquest was opened into the deaths of Geoffrey Stewart Toase and Michael William Midgley.

The inquest concluded on 2 August 2024, the conclusion reached was the short form conclusion of road traffic collision.","On 3 August 2019, Mr Toase and Mr Midgley had arranged to spend the day riding their motorcycles around Yorkshire, they were accompanied by two associates.

At around 3:45pm, whilst travelling down the A166 Garrowby Hill, Mr Toase and Mr Midgley were involved in a head on collision with a car that was travelling from the opposite direction. That car was located wholly on the wrong side of the carriageway at the point at which it collided with Mr Toase and Mr Midgley.

The driver of the car involved had a number of health-related conditions, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, controlled by insulin injection. As a result of the diabetes, the driver of the car was required to reapply to the DVLA for a licence every 3 years.

At the time of the collision, the driver of the car was, on the balance of probability, suffering a hypoglycaemic episode which had compromised their ability to drive in an appropriate manner.

Emergency services attended the collision scene swiftly, but the injuries suffered by both Mr Toase and Mr Midgley were such that nothing could be done to save them and they were both declared deceased at the incident scene.","I heard evidence from two representatives of the DVLA at the inquest, including a DVLA employed Doctor. That Doctor gave evidence about their role in the medical review and decision to re-issue a license to the driver of the car involved in the fatal collision. That evidence gave rise to the following concerns:

a) DVLA Doctors are not actively encouraged by the DVLA to request further information about an applicant’s medical history.

b) The DVLA does not generally seek further information from any identified Speciality Doctor that may be involved in an applicant’s medical care and treatment; any requests for further information are usually directed to an applicant’s General Practitioner (GP).

c) The forms sent to an applicant’s GP by the DVLA for the purpose of obtaining further information are largely tick box in nature and do not provide sufficient scope for the GP to provide more detailed information and this therefore does not allow for a full assessment to be conducted by the reviewing DVLA Doctor.

d) Current DVLA working practices do not appear to allow DVLA Doctors to consider the interplay between different medical conditions an applicant may be suffering with.

e) There is no apparent system in place to verify the accuracy of the information provided by an applicant within their medical self-declaration and that this information is generally accepted by the DVLA without question.

f) The information provided by an applicant within their medical self-declaration is no longer sent to their GP by the DVLA alongside any request for further information, which limits any scope for the GP to identify if the information contained within a medical self-declaration is accurate.

g) The DVLA Doctor involved in this case gave evidence that they felt “constrained” by the DVLA guidance, standards and working practices they are required to work to.

h) The decisions made by DVLA Doctors when considering to re-issue a license are not subject to any form of audit procedure to ensure accuracy and consistency of decision-making.",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,<NA>,Other

On 25 July 2024 I concluded an inquest into his death at the end of a 3-day hearing.,"The immediate circumstances are that: On 24 March 2023, Martyn was detained by police in Sussex after being found at [REDACTED] where he had ostensibly gone to take his own life. He was taken to Eastbourne District General Hospital. There he was assessed and deemed liable for detention under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. However, there were no available mental health beds nationally and a suitable placement could not be found for him. Having been at the hospital since Friday evening, he contacted family members on Sunday, 26 March who collected him and brought him back to his home in Oxfordshire.

On 27 March 2023, Martyn left his home and stepped in front of a lorry on the A4074. Witnesses described his actions as deliberate. The medical cause of death was determined following a post-mortem examination to be multi-organ failure and polytrauma resulting from a road traffic collision.","As you will note from the Conclusion, an application for compulsory detention for Martyn could not be completed due to the unavailability of beds despite extensive searches nationally.

My findings were that: ‘It is the case that a Health Based Place of Safety bed did become available but a decision was taken that due to anticipated demand for potential patients not to offer this to Martyn.’

And also that: ‘in my view highly likely that Martyn would have benefitted from a further admission to hospital – as he had previously – and he would have prevented from further relapse and ultimately taking the actions he did on the morning of 27 March.’

The conclusion of the inquest recorded that Thomas Joseph McAuley died as a consequence of an accident.","Thomas Joseph McAuley was employed by Kiely Brothers Limited (“KBL”) as part of a crew of men undertaking road resurfacing works. On 5 July 2022, Mr McAuley, together with a crew of 6 others, was undertaking resurfacing work in Redwood Drive, Ferndown. At approximately 11 am Mr McAuley placed himself within the area between the third and fourth axles of a four axle, 32 tonne grab lorry that was on site. This was likely so that he could urinate. The driver of the grab lorry was unaware of Mr McAuley’s presence within this area and moved the grab lorry forward a short distance and at low speed, causing Mr McAuley catastrophic injuries that caused his death.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. It is common practice for members of roadwork crews to use the space between the rear axles of LGVs to urinate, even when a welfare van has been provided on site. A witness who had worked for at least one company as part of a roadwork crew prior to joining KBL gave evidence that it was a practice that he was aware of “since starting on the roads”. Although it would seem that KBL employees no longer engage in this practice, likely because of the tragic death of Mr McAuley, there was no evidence available at the inquest to suggest his death had had an impact on the industry more widely.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. If the practice of using the space between the rear axles of an LGV is ongoing, there remains a risk of future deaths, as any small movement of the vehicle can cause fatal injuries. I am not aware of any safety notice(s) being issued since Mr McAuley’s death or any wider publicity that may have highlighted the risk.

Bennett,Birmingham and Solihull,"Chief Executive, Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust",On 2 January 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kieran Lavin. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held between 22-25 July 2024.,"Kieran had experienced anxiety and depressive symptoms for around 10 years with worsening symptoms in late 2023. In November he consulted his GP having inadvertently stopped taking his anti-depressant medication. On 5 December he reported worsening symptoms after restarting his medication for two weeks, and said he had thoughts of jumping in front of a vehicle and an overdose, citing the breakdown of his relationship with his wife as one of the triggers. He was referred to the Crisis team and assessed on 7 December reporting no active suicidal plans. His anti-depressant medication was increased, and he agreed to be seen routinely in 4 months. The following day, on 8 December he booked into a hotel to overdose on his medication with alcohol. He was surprised to wake up and was admitted to the Emergency Department early on 9 December. Psychiatry & Liaison referred him to the Psychiatric Decisions Unit (‘PDU’) for further assessment as he could not guarantee his safety. He arrived at the Oleaster Centre, Birmingham at 9:55pm. The following day, early morning on 10 December during a nurse assessment he said he was angry the overdose attempt had not worked, and if he went home, he would maybe throw himself in front of a lorry. He cited in part the relationship breakdown with his wife as one of the triggers for his presentation. Later that day, he was assessed by a consultant psychiatrist whose impression was of a depressive episode, and that Kieran required informal admission as he did not feel safe to go home, which Kieran agreed with. The following day, by 11am on 11 December Kieran proactively contacted a second nurse reporting when outside the unit for a cigarette he had terrible thoughts, and he does not feel safe going outside because he thinks he needs to kill himself and he will run and jump in front of a car or train. Around 1-2pm he was assessed by a junior Dr and reported no active suicidal plans, but her impression was he was very anxious and depressed, and the plan was maintained. The long wait for a bed was due to the mental health service having no available inpatient bed. A private mental health service agreed to admit him in Willenhall. Kieran’s wife had arrived to drop off some clothes and Kieran asked if his wife could drive him. The bed manager, also nurse in charge of the Oleaster Centre, had intended that Kieran be transported via taxi accompanied by a member of staff, but agreed to his wife driving him on the basis Kieran was a voluntary inpatient, wanted treatment, and assessed his presentation on and off the PDU as raising no safety concerns. He did not record his risk formulation. He was not aware of the two reports of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision. Had he looked at the ‘level 1 risk screening’ neither nurse had at this stage updated the ‘suicide’ box. No record of his suicidal ideation on 10 December was ever added, and the suicidal ideation reported on the morning 11 December was not added until 8:51pm and after the incident had occurred. Whether his wife’s presence would exacerbate Kieran’s presentation was not fully considered, or the length and nature of the journey. His wife was not informed of Kieran’s reported suicidal ideation. The mental health service’s policies, procedures and guidelines did not set out a clear approach to assist regarding what should happen when a patient requests for family to transfer them to another location for an informal admission. Kieran left with his wife in her car around 7:45pm. Shortly after 8pm, having just spoken on the phone to his mum, he suddenly proceeded to open the passenger door whilst in lane 1 of the M5 motorway. His wife attempted to physically stop him whilst managing to move to the hard-shoulder whereby Kieran exited the passenger door and walked around the rear of the car into the path of an oncoming large lorry in lane 1, and thereafter was struck by a second car. He was confirmed deceased at the scene from the consequential injuries (1a. Multiple injuries).

The inquest conclusion was: “Suicide, contributed to by a failure to conduct an adequate patient transport risk assessment which would have likely changed the outcome.”","1. Critical suicide risk information was not recorded at all or not recorded in a timely manner. On 10/12/23, the experienced nurse did not record at all in the ‘suicide’ box on the ‘level 1 – risk screening’ the first report of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision. She described this omission as an error and the likely explanation was that she was the only nurse working on a very busy shift. On 11/12/23, the experienced nurse did not in a timely manner record in the ‘suicide’ box on the ‘level 1 – risk screening’ the second report of suicidal ideation via road traffic collision received by 11am. She said the likely explanation for not updating the ‘suicide’ box until 8:51pm (and after the nurse-in-charge made his transport risk formulation) was that she was the only nurse working on a very busy shift. The experienced nurse-in-charge did not record at all his transport risk formulation saying that was not his usual practice. The Patient Safety Manager said long standing trust policy required clinicians to record key information as soon as possible. I am not persuaded this long standing policy is sufficient by itself to remove the risk in the future of critical suicide risk information not being recorded at all or in a timely manner given three experienced nurses within 24 hours failed to follow the policy.

2. Post-death trust learning led to new guidance for when an informal patient requests family, carer, or friend transport them from PDU. For ease of reference it states:

“Where appropriate, it is reasonable for the option of an informal patient to be transported by family/carer/friends. In all such cases, decision needs to be based on the risk/benefit ratio and this also needs to be clearly discussed with the person transporting to make sure there is understanding and agreement. This needs to be clearly documented within the patient’s notes. If there is any concern or disagreement expressed by the person, family/carer/friends, then alternative arrangements need to be made by us.”

I am not persuaded this is sufficient to remove the risk of an inadequate risk assessment in the future. By way of contrast, trust guidance C52 ‘Mental Health Act Transport of Patients’ - which applies when a patient has been assessed under the Act and ambulance service transport is to be used - at paragraph 12 includes 15 specific questions that the risk assessor should ask as part of the transport risk formulation, including: How far does the patient have to travel? What is the patient’s age and gender? What is their current state of mind? Is there a risk to the driver/accompanying individuals? The updated guidance cited above is absent any equivalent specific questions or assistance on when it is or is not appropriate. For example, in Kieran’s case clinicians were aware his sex, age, and background of relationship breakdown statistically recognised him as being at a higher risk of suicide, PDU is only intended for a brief stay whereas Kieran was there for nearly 48 hours and his state of mind was not assessed in the hours before the risk formulation (even though it was known to fluctuate), the journey if considered would have been noted to take him away from local roads onto a high speed motorway, and his wife/the driver was known to be a trigger for his low mood. Further, there was no consideration of what his wife had to be told to ensure she was safe, providing genuine informed consent given the interplay of patient confidentiality. In Kieran’s case the transport risk formulation did not consider whether his risk of suicide included road traffic collision vs an unrelated mechanism. My concern is the above cited guidance in simply stating the decision should be based on ‘appropriateness’ and ‘the risk/benefit ratio’ does not sufficiently prompt clinicians to consider the full range of key issues and is inconsistent with the more expansive guidance in C52 for when an ambulance is to be used.

For completeness, (1) there was discussion during the inquest about why there cannot be a blanket ban on informal patients with recent suicidal ideation via road traffic collision being transported by family etc given they represent a very small cohort of patients. If no such ban is considered appropriate, in my view, the need for more expansive and specific guidance for clinicians equivalent to C52 is increased, and (2) there was discussion at the inquest of a transport risk formulation based on a points system with a written draft suggestion from the Family’s counsel; I attach a copy which may be of assistance for the trust when deciding what if any action to take.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Pedestrian

A. Speed limit

The designated speed for this section of road was 60 mph.

The charity BRAKE have stated that the default speed limit on rural roads is 60 mph, a speed at which it is rarely safe to travel.

They stated the approach should be based on the design of roads. This road has an uneven road surface and it was within local knowledge that the designated speed limit was dangerous and could lead to a loss of control whilst driving in the upper speed range.

The need for a reduction in the limit as a safety measure does not appear to have been raised during inspections/debriefs following a series of fatalities that have led to a number of drowning incidents along this section of road. It raises a concern that the speed limit should be reduced significantly as a risk reduction measure – some areas have adopted 20 mph on some sections of road.

B. Inspections of the road

I have a concern that inspections of the road have not been sufficiently rigorous given a recurring issue of highway degradation from ‘rutting’ at the carriageway edge which can be a contributory factor causing loss of control of a vehicle.

It is unclear if the council have carried out audits to review the quality of inspections and whether there have been examples of substandard inspections.

C. Length of time to effect remedial action

These deaths occurred on 7 June 2020 and there had been previous fatalities along this road which had led to fatalities caused by drowning when vehicles left the road.

A barrier to prevent entry to the waterway would be one effective measure that has been deployed in many other places to prevent a vehicle leaving the road and yet, I understand no final solution is in place.

D. Highway degradation

This has been an issue and I have a concern about prompt repairs being effected to the road and also the weight of vehicles which is a factor in damage to the verge adjacent to the road itself.

E. Local safety group

The Fenland Road Safety Campaign (Charlotte’s Way) have undertaken outstanding work as a charity in raising awareness of the dangers of Fenland roads given the unique environmental factors involved. It is not clear whether there has been prompt action taken following representations from them on safety matters.

A. Cluster sites

Councils have a number of roads that feature on a cluster site analysis. By their nature, these will carry an obvious and serious risk of death or significant injury. Funding pressures in recent years have delayed prompt action in risk reduction at these sites. It raises a question of whether there should be a central government fund as a special measure to release capital for such sites as this would lead to enhanced risk reduction repairs being deployed more quickly.

On the facts of this investigation, this road had seen a number of fatalities which would not be known to those unfamiliar with the area (as here).

The conclusion of the inquest was that Brogen-Lea died after sustaining catastrophic injuries as a pedestrian in a road traffic collision.,"Brogen-Lea, a schoolgirl, was walking home in the Cannock area of Staffordshire at about 18:30 on 29 November 2022. She was late and was likely in a rush. Brogen-Lea emerged from a footpath which is bisected by a busy road subject to a 50 mph limit. She continued into the carriageway and was struck by a car. The driver of the car had not seen her, likely because of a combination of her clothing and the failure of streetlamps in the area. Brogen-Lea sustained injuries from which she later died.","The track along which Brogen-Lea walked is well-used and is bisected by a busy road with traffic travelling at speed.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 July 2024.","On 13 December 2023, Barry Howard was travelling along Mill Lane towards Shotesham Ford, an unbridged Ford, after 10pm. He was not familiar with the road which had previously been closed at the request of police due to flooding. The temporary signs indicating that the road was closed and impassable were not visible and the signs warning of the Ford and the depth of water, were beyond the flooded section of road, and on the balance of probabilities were not visible to Mr Howard before he entered the water.

After entering the water his car was swept away into the river and he was found deceased in his car, which was almost completely submerged, at the Unbridged Ford, Mill Lane, Shotesham, Norfolk on 14 December 2023.","i. While the evidence I heard was that the Council consider that the current signage is adequate and has been inspected, there was a history of incidents reported to them, and sadly the very tragic death of Barry. That suggests that, while they consider it adequate, it was not sufficiently so to prevent those incidents and Barry’s death. I have heard nothing to reassure me that appropriate action has been taken to prevent others continuing to fail to be aware of the risk of the unbridged ford, especially after heavy periods of rain.

ii. A lack of any appropriate warning signs that this ford is prone to flooding which may make it unsafe to cross.

iii. A lack of signs sufficiently in advance of the ford so as to warn road users at times of extreme flooding. The current signs were well within the flooded area on the night in question and I am concerned they would not be visible, especially to those unfamiliar with the road and in the dark, until they were already in the flood water.

iv. The slippery surface of the road.

v. The insufficiency of the temporary road closed signs used and the lack of more permanent measures, in accordance with guidelines, once the closure lasted more than 24 hours. It was only a week prior to the inquest, some 7 months after this death, that action was taken. I am concerned that such lengthy delays to implement safety measures will lead to a risk in future incidents at this and possibly other locations.

vi. The evidence was that more appropriate measures for road closure should have been considered, but there was no evidence as to why they were not, or that this has been considered and action taken to address the reasons.

C. The control room supervisor forwarded the message to the intelligence team to establish who the i-Phone belonged to and whether there was any serious harm or risk to life at that time.

But for a separate telephone call from a member of the public at 22.45, further steps may have been made to make contact (one of which, an “Ictrak” message which was sent to the i-Phone at 22.59 asking whether there was an emergency and requesting a 999 call if so) or a police vehicle may have been assigned to attend the GPS co-ordinates provided by the i-Phone or no further action taken.
E. The evidence indicated that false alarms from electronic devices such as telephones and watches are commonplace, and that locations received from such devices were often inaccurate and liable to involve substantial police time in tracking the device down.
F. The Apple serious car crash detection automatic calls were a recent development at the time of the index accident. Other manufacturers have launched a similar feature.

In addition, evidence was heard that when meetings were changed at short notice (due to unforeseen circumstances, staff sickness or leave absence), Owen himself would be informed, but not his agreed next of kin contact.

This led to Owen missing a number of appointments as he had forgotten the changes made, whereas his next of kin would have been able to remind him, and prompt him to attend.

It was acknowledged by the court, that in Owen’s case there was no evidence that his attendance at one of his missed appointments would have changed the tragic outcome.

Road Traffic Collision","The circumstances of the death are as follows: -

On 27 August 2019 at about 2030 hours there was a head-on collision between a car driven by [REDACTED], an employee of the US Government who had not long been in the UK and whose husband worked out of the nearby RAF Croughton, and a motorcycle ridden by Mr Harry Dunn.

Mr Dunn suffered catastrophic injuries including fractures to all four limbs, some of which were open in nature, and a fracture to his pelvis with the concomitant severe internal blood loss commonly associated with such serious injuries.

The only available emergency medical resource was that run by the Air Ambulance Service Charity which was an advanced medical team based out of Coventry Airport, some c.30 miles away with an estimated arrival time of 57 minutes.

(2) The inquest heard that EMAS was unable to meet mean response standards at the time of the 999 call. They had entered a sustained period where demand was outstripping the resources they had available. This was worsened by the fact that what resources they did have were being delayed at hospitals due to lengthy hospital handovers at the accident and emergency departments.

(3) Although EMAS reported a slight improvement in the issue of resourcing following the adoption of the newer NHS Pathways triage process the delay in paramedics attending Category 2 calls has not been resolved to within target ranges. This is because EMAS's resources cannot be fully utilised as a result of the delays in ambulances clearing accident and emergency departments.

On 4 April 2022 Paul was a passenger in a vehicle involved in a road traffic collision as a result of which he sustained chest injuries comprising fractured ribs and a fractured sternum

ii. Paul was admitted to the emergency department of the Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro the same day for treatment of his injuries. Although Paul was initially lucid, over the subsequent few days he developed delirium which was probably due to a combination of the trauma, his age and frailty, the painkilling medication and disorientation being in a busy acute hospital.

iii. On the evening of 16 April 2022 Paul was transferred from the Royal Cornwall Hospital to Liskeard Community Hospital. Paul's medical condition had stabilised and it was felt that a community hospital was the best location for rehabilitation and for his delirium to settle. The clinician with care of Paul felt that his prognosis was guarded although that was not communicated to Paul's family.

iv. Unfortunately Paul's condition deteriorated on 17 April 2022. The nursing staff had difficulty encouraging Paul to eat and hydrate, his heart rate and rate of breathing had increased. Those treating him felt that Paul was suffering from an infection. A decision was taken to transfer Paul back to the Royal Cornwall Hospital which took place in the early hours of 18 April 2022.

v. At the Royal Cornwall Hospital Paul was given intravenous antibiotics and fluids. It was felt that Paul did not have an infection and that the principal issue was dehydration. By late morning on 18 April 2022 clinical staff considered that his condition had stabilised and he could be transferred back to Liskeard albeit that his dehydration had not resolved and intravenous fluids needed to be continued.

vi. Because of Paul's ongoing dehydration and overall frailty there needed to be a robust and detailed handover between treating doctors from the two hospitals as to the ongoing treatment plan and what to do in the event of Paul deteriorating. This did not take place. There was a nurse to nurse handover without sufficient details being exchanged or recorded, particularly with regard to the unresolved dehydration. There was also an error in the date of the prescription for the intravenous fluids which resulted in a delay to Paul receiving fluids.

vii. Paul's condition deteriorated again resulting in him being transferred back to the Royal Cornwall Hospital at 18:45 the same day where he received appropriate treatment for dehydration and a possible infection.

viii. Unfortunately whilst Paul's condition stabilised his delirium persisted and it was felt that he should return home for palliative care. Paul returned home on 16 May where he died on 29 May 2022.

ix. The planning and handover for Paul's transfer between the Royal Cornwall Hospital and Liskeard Community Hospital at around midday on 18 April 2022 was inadequate and caused significant discomfort and distress to Paul and a delay to the treatment of the dehydration.

Thereafter, a referral was made to the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to rule 25 (4) of The Coroners (Inquest) Rules 2013. The inquests were resumed and concluded on 30 April 2024.","Charlie Hopkins had passed his driving test on 11 September 2021, shortly before the collision on 26 September 2021. The court found that it was possible that Charlie being a new driver, who had only recently passed his test, contributed to the collision.

At the time of the collision, in addition to Charlie Hopkins and William Robinson, there were six other passengers in the car, five on the back seat and one in the boot of the car, making a total of eight people in the car. The court found that it was possible that Charlie Hopkins had been distracted by the other passengers in the car, thereby contributing to the collision.

The VW Polo involved in the collision underwent an annual MOT and regular services at both VW and non-VW affiliated garages. The airbag fault and non-functioning warning light was not identified during any of the MOTs and at only two of the services the car underwent prior to the collision.","Concern 1

As set out above, the court found that it was possible that the fact that Charlie Hopkins had only just passed his driving test contributed to the collision.

During the course of the inquest, the court’s attention was drawn to statistics which suggest that road traffic collisions involving young, new drivers, are a leading cause of death for young people.

As such, you are invited to consider whether any additional measures ought to be introduced to mitigate the ongoing risk in respect of young, new drivers, including by way of the introduction of restrictions on when they can drive and who they can carry as passengers.

Concern 2

It is deeply concerning that such a significant safety fault with the VW Polo was not identified during the course of any of the annual MOTs it underwent from 14 March 2014 onwards.

The court heard that the MOT manual itself does not require MOT testers to:

(i) Check whether airbag warning lights are actually working.

The court heard that it is quick and simple to check that a car’s airbag warning light is working. It is done by checking that the light illuminates briefly when the engine is switched on. Further the court heard that the MOT manual requires MOT testers to check that the anti-lock braking system (ABS) warning light is working in this manner.

(ii) Carry out a diagnostic check of the car’s electrical systems to check whether there are any faults with the airbag module.

The court heard that MOT testers rely on the illuminated warning light to assess whether there are any faults with the car’s airbag module. However, this will not identify a fault if the airbag warning light has been concealed. The court heard that there are universal diagnostic tools which can diagnose electrical faults, including airbag module faults, on any type of car, regardless of the manufacturer.

The Coroner considers that there is a gap in the MOT manual which presents a risk of future deaths and you are invited to consider whether any amendments ought to be introduced to the MOT Manual to mitigate against that risk.

Concern 3

It is concerning that such a significant safety fault with the VW Polo was not picked up during many of the regular services that the car underwent during the same time period.

The court heard evidence that it is not standard practice for car services to include a check of whether the airbag warning light is functioning. Further, the court heard that it is not standard practice to carry out a diagnostic check of a car’s electronic safety systems unless a car is being taken to a garage that is associated with the particular car’s manufacturer, despite the availability of universal diagnostic tools.

Given the limitations of the MOT test, as set out above, the Coroner considers that this presents a risk of future deaths and you are invited to consider whether additional standards and/or guidance on these matters ought to be introduced for garages/mechanics involved in the conduct of car services.",True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

Ollivere,Birmingham and Solihull,University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust,"On 9 November 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of James Patrick Pearson. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was; died as a result of complications of prolonged hospital admission, in combination with injuries sustained in a road traffic collision, and subsequent hypoxic brain injury, following cardiac arrest.","On 14 June 2023, James Pearson was hit by a vehicle on A4540 Birmingham. He was assessed at the scene and his injuries did not appear to be serious. He was taken to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital where a CT scan showed an axonal brain injury, small bleed to the brain, and severe pelvic injuries with suspicion of an active bleed. Observations taken at 03:16 indicated that he was maintaining his blood pressure and the Consultant at the time did not feel he was actively bleeding. James went into peri-arrest, and subsequently suffered a cardiac arrest. After 12 minutes of CPR, a return of spontaneous circulation was achieved, however, James had suffered hypoxic brain injury as a result of the cardiac arrest. This, alongside the traumatic brain injury sustained in the road traffic collision resulted in a prolonged stay in hospital for James, who continued to decline, and developed hospital acquired pneumonia. He was transferred to St Catherine's Hospice in Preston on 12 October 2023 for end of life care, and he passed away there on 22 October 2023. Whilst at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital an opportunity to provide fluids to James was missed, which, on the balance of probabilities would have prevented his cardiac arrest and subsequent hypoxic brain injury.

Following a post mortem, the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a  Pneumonia

1b  Diffuse axonal injury and hypoxic brain injury

1c  Road traffic collision

II   Malnutrition","1. Having had a CT scan at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital on 14 June 2023, James Pearson was diagnosed with severe pelvic injuries, and the Radiologist reported findings which were consistent with an active pelvic bleed.
2. At 03:16, observations were taken, and the Doctor was satisfied that James was maintaining his blood pressure and therefore was not actively bleeding at that time.
3. During the inquest, I heard that James was attached to a monitor, which was taking his observations every 15 minutes. None of these observations, however, were documented. This is of concern, as it is not possible to know at what point James began to decline. I am concerned that lack of proper documented observations could lead to future deaths, as staff will not be able to follow the observation pattern and notice a decline in presentation.
4. At 04:20, James became more agitated and nurses noted a drop in consciousness. At this point the Major Haemorrhage Protocol was activated at 04:23, as there was now a suspicion of ongoing bleeding.
5. Whilst waiting for his blood products, James suffered a cardiac arrest at 04:25.
6. [REDACTED] told me in evidence that during the time since his last review by a Doctor at 03:16, and his cardiac arrest at 04:25, James was not seen by a Doctor, and only Nurses were available in the department. The only Doctor on shift at that time was dealing with another very unwell patient, who also required resuscitation.
7. [REDACTED] told me that at the point in time the deterioration in James was noticed, sometime between 04:00-04:20, James should have received fluids, and in his opinion, if he had done so, on the balance of probabilities, he would not have had a cardiac arrest. He added that this was beyond what he would expect a nurse to adduce, however, if the Doctor had been present, he believed this would have been done.
8. I am therefore concerned that there were not enough Doctors in the department at the time, meaning that there is no resilience to deal effectively with more than one very unwell patient at any given time. If this is not addressed, there is a risk of future deaths.
9. I further heard from [REDACTED] that the blood products at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital are not kept in the ED, and are kept some distance away, and could take up to 20 minutes to obtain after the major haemorrhage protocol is activated. Whilst this is unlikely to have affected the outcome for James, due to his sudden deterioration, I am concerned that a delay in obtaining blood products could lead to future deaths.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Pedestrian

Kaushal,Derby and Derbyshire,,On 21 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Scott aged 24. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 April 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that:,"Matthew James Scott died on 11 March 2023 whilst travelling east on Station Road, Melbourne. The road had a speed limit of 40 mph. He was travelling to his place of work at East Midlands Airport when he hit a lengthy defective and subsided stretch of road which was filled with ice. That combined with his speed, which was likely to be in excess of 40 mph, caused him to lose control, impact with a tree and sadly resulted in his death.","At 6 weeks post Mr Scott's death - on 28 April 2023 - a discussion took place between collision investigator officers, a traffic management officer (all of Derbyshire police) with the Project Engineer of the Highways Authority of Derbyshire County Council. The officers raised their concerns that at the place where Mr Scott lost control of his vehicle (Station Road, Melbourne Derbyshire) there was a lengthy, defective and subsided stretch of road. Further, that at the time of Mr Scott's death the subsided section of road was some 4 metres in width, 37 metres in length and 5 cm in depth. Further, that it was deep enough to have had standing water in it which at the time of Mr Scott's death had turned to ice.

Ice in this said defect would likely cause a vehicle to lose grip on the road surface. At that section of road, the road starts to bend to the right such that losing control on the ice could cause a vehicle to veer to the offside of the road, either into the path of an oncoming vehicle, into the opposite field or as in Mr Scott's case, a tree.

The Project Engineer of the Highways Authority discussed his concerns and the concerns that had been raised by the police, with the highway maintenance department in early May 2023. As at the date of the inquest into Mr Scott's death (22 April 2024) this stretch of road had not been surveyed, no consideration had been given to the concerns of the police and no decisions taken to repair the defect so as to prevent any further accidents.",False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,24,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 April 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

On the evening of Thursday 18 May 2023 the deceased was driving a VW Golf south along a country road, namely Lee Lane, Romsey, in the vicinity of its junction with Spaniard Lane when at around 22:16 to 22:26 he lost control of the car by reason of his speed on a crest in the road, and hit a large tree.

The deceased lost control of his vehicle on the crest.
B. The maximum speed at which a person can travel over the crest whilst remaining in full control of the vehicle is 45 mph. A driver negotiating the crest around the speed limit of 60 mph will run the risk of the vehicle leaving the ground, or at the very least a momentary loss of effective steering control, followed by the underside ‘bottoming out’ on the road surface. Numerous historical gouge marks on the road surface either side of the junction demonstrate that “numerous vehicles have previously ‘bottomed out.’”
C. When travelling south, approaching the crest, as the deceased did, it is possible to see a bend in the road in the distance, but the road immediately beyond the crest is not visible to a car driver.
D. It is suspected that there have been previous collisions at the scene.

Puzey,Worcestershire,General Secretary of the Auto Cycle Union,"On 22 June 2023 HMSC David Reid commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher William Townsend, aged 43. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 5 April 2024 which I heard. The conclusion of the inquest was that the medical cause of death was pneumonia as a result of multiple injuries sustained in a motor cycle accident and that Mr Townsend died as a result of an accident.","Christopher William Townsend died on 8 June 2023 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. He was involved in a motor accident on 4 June 2023 whilst participating in an organised grass-track motorcycle and sidecar race. He sustained multiple chest and abdominal injuries from which he did not recover.","(1) The risk assessment prepared for the grass-track event on 4 June 2024 was a downloaded proforma from the ACU publication “ACU Requirements for Safety Precautions At All Track Race Events Held Under An ACU Permit” (p.19 of 26). This document listed pre-populated control measures to address a list of pre-populated risks. The control measures were ticked “yes” or “no” by the organiser to indicate whether they were in place. The assessment of the level of that risk as high, medium or low was also pre-populated. This did not amount to a process that could produce an event specific risk assessment nor did it encourage organisers to record meaningful conclusions about controlling risk at their event. I was told by [REDACTED] that this was a pro-forma for grass track events and that more complex, event specific risk assessments were produced for other types of event. He also confirmed that the risk assessment pro-forma were under review by the ACU and he produced an example of a potential new pro-forma requiring significantly more individual assessment and input. I accept that the ACU is taking steps to address the inadequacy of the grass track event risk assessment process.
(2) However, in my questions to [REDACTED] he confirmed that there is no requirement for organisers of events held under the ACU Regulations to prepare an event-specific Safety Plan at either National or Club events. There is such a requirement for ACU events held on an international/European permit (paragraph 3.26 National Sporting Code 2023). [REDACTED] confirmed that whilst it is not an ACU requirement to prepare such a plan for Club/National events it is open to organisers to do so. Appendix 3 of the ACU’s publication provides an example of contents list of an event safety plan.
(3) Planning for safety at motorsport events to which the public are admitted must be thorough, comprehensive and verifiable by being recorded. This allows organisers to record and disseminate safety arrangements for their events. The risks may differ in scale, but not substantially in nature, as between international and national/club events.
(4) In my opinion, in the absence of such methodical planning and recording there is a risk of future deaths arising from the current arrangements for safety planning at ACU track race events.
(5) I have carefully considered [REDACTED] evidence as to the reviews that are being undertaken by the ACU of their procedures and guidance. This was provided in his written evidence, his answers in oral evidence and in the letter from him dated 5 April 2024. I have also carefully considered the cogent submissions on behalf of the ACU by [REDACTED] of DWF, in particular as to Chief Coroner’s Guidance Note 5 (November 2020), especially paragraph 7 thereof. Nonetheless, I remain of the opinion that in the absence of a requirement for a recorded safety plan for each event there is a risk that future deaths will occur.

It does not allay my concerns but rather confirms that serious injuries and fatalities do occur at these events not infrequently.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,43,Male,Other

Lees,The Black Country Jurisdiction,Walsall MBC,"On 22/12/23 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr David Wellington aged 54 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23/4/24. The medical cause for the death of Mr Wellington was;

1a Haemothorax
1b Fatal chest injuries
1c Road traffic accident

The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision.","At approximately 10:34 hrs on Tuesday 12 December 2023, a fatal road traffic collision occurred on a service road off Leamore Lane, Walsall. The collision occurred between a Renault box van and Mr David Wellington who was a pedestrian. The van was reversing at the time of the collision. As a result of the collision sadly Mr David Wellington died at the scene.

Mr Wellington was a resident at a block of flats accessed via the service road on which the collision took place.

The collision itself was captured in its entirety on nearby CCTV. A police investigation established that Mr Wellington (who was wearing a parka coat with the hood up) had entered the service road through a pedestrian barrier and was positioned in the blind spot of the reversing van and that Mr Wellington would not have been visible to the driver. It is not known whether Mr Wellington had seen the van reversing. The driver of the white van was using his hazard lights but the van did not have warning beeps when reversing as this was not a legal requirement for this size of van. The van was noted to be particularly quiet when reversing. It is not known why Mr Wellington did not appear to hear the vehicle reversing.","1. I heard evidence at inquest that the service road provides access to the shops that face onto Leamore Lane for delivery purposes. The service road opening is off Bloxwich Road and has a barrier which is operated manually, being opened for deliveries normally by the shopkeepers. I heard evidence that the service road is a single carriageway which is used by both vehicles and pedestrians. As you enter the road, the road is lined with metal fencing on the left side of the road which has openings onto two pathways for access to the flats on Cornwall Close (incorrectly referred to as Camwell Close in the police report).

2. There is no designated pathway for pedestrians when using the service road for the purpose of accessing the nearby flats. Designated pedestrian access from Leamore Lane and Bloxwich Road via a pathway still requires a pedestrian to cross the service road itself. Pedestrian access is not sited on the same side as the flats. In my view this presents a risk of future deaths.

3. There are no road markings designating a pedestrian route nor any clear and designated pathway separating a pedestrian route to the flats from the service road itself. In my view this presents a risk of future deaths.

4. On the day of the collision, there were two large council bins intruding into the carriageway positioned just before the opening of the pathway. There were also two vehicles parked stationary at the side of the service road and a blue skip in the roadway. It was obvious from the evidence that the service road was being used for purposes other than that for which it was designed and that there were a number of obstructions present in the service road presenting a risk to pedestrians using the service road to access the flats and therefore reducing their visibility to vehicles using the service access road. In my view this presents a risk of future deaths.

5. The manual operation of the barrier coupled with the obstructions in the service road itself present a risk to the ability of emergency services (Fire & Ambulance) to access the service road and operate effectively within the service road area if needed. The police investigation noted that the skip and bins had to be moved out of the way on the day of the incident involving Mr Wellington to make room for the emergency services. In my view this presents a risk of future deaths.

Whilst it was not possible to establish whether Shirley Ann Hunt would have survived the impact if she had been wearing a seatbelt, as a wider point of public safety, I am concerned that adults and children over three years can travel in the rear areas of motorhomes without restraint, and that in doing so, this may create a risk to life.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,44,Female,Other

Griffin,Dorset,"The Rt Hon Victoria Atkins MP, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care; Chief Executive Officer for NHS England","On the 23rd March 2022, an investigation was commenced into the death of Richard Andrew Collins, born on the 16 January 1966.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 29 February 2024.","At approximately 20.45 hours on 9 February 2022 Richard, who had a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, abandoned his vehicle on the verge of the eastbound carriageway of the A421 in Bedfordshire. Following this he was walking about half a metre into the carriageway of lane one of the eastbound carriageway of the A421 about 1.15km west of the roundabout junction with the A421 towards Bedford, when he was struck by the left front side of an articulated lorry. He was found a short time later in a collapsed and unresponsive condition on the grass verge on the side of the A421 and despite resuscitation attempts his death was confirmed.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. There is a legal duty upon a driving licence holder to inform the DVLA of any illness or injury, both physical and mental, that would have a likely impact on safe driving ability. In addition to this, as detailed at page 9 of the DVLA Assessing fitness to drive – a guide for medical professionals Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk), doctors and other healthcare professionals should:

• advise the individual on the impact of their medical condition for safe driving ability
• advise the individual on their legal requirement to notify DVLA of any relevant condition
• notify DVLA directly of an individual’s medical condition or fitness to drive, where they cannot or will not notify DVLA themselves

ii. Prior to his death Richard had been detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 between 9 December and 20 December 2021 following a relapse of his mental health and his presentation with symptoms of hypomania. He remained a voluntary patient until his discharge on 7 January 2022. He was advised of his duty to notify the DVLA of his illness by the treating consultant during his admission, however the DVLA were not notified prior to his death and so a full driving licence remained in force.

iii. Following his release from hospital Richard was under the care of the community mental health team. On 13 January 2022 his mother contacted his care coordinator, a mental health nurse, and advised that he had purchased a car and had driven it the previous day. On 31 January 2022 he was assessed under the Mental Health Act 1983 following the police exercising their powers under section 136 of that Act, however was not deemed to require detention.

iv. Between the date of his release from hospital and his death Richard had a number of contacts with representatives from the secondary mental health services. No medical professional discussed Richard’s driving or notification to the DVLA with him after his discharge from hospital, despite there being opportunities to do so. His driving licence remained in force and consideration was not given to its medical revocation prior to his death.

v. Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust (DHUFT), who provide the secondary mental health care services in Dorset, did not have a local written policy in place at the time of Richard’s death in relation to assessing patients’ fitness to drive and contacting with the DVLA. Since Richard’s death DHUFT have implemented a written policy which is accessible to all employees of the trust including mental health practitioners and nurses as well as doctors. This has been well received and felt to be very clear. This provides guidance around the duties upon medical professionals and to support decisions where an individual’s ability to drive safely is brought into question. The trust have also changed their practice as a result of the learning from Richard’s death. For example, DHUFT have a checklist for all inpatient meetings which now includes the DVLA requirements so that they are considered at every discussion with, or about, the patient.

vi. Although there is current guidance from the General Medical Council (GMC) and the DVLA to medical professionals about assessing fitness to drive and notifying the DVLA of concerns, I have not been made aware of any national guidance for NHS trusts on the issue of local trust guidance or policy which could help to ensure awareness of, and compliance with the legal duties relating to the medical revocation of driving licences.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. Whilst considerable work has been undertaken within the secondary mental health services in Dorset, I am concerned that there may be similar issues or missed opportunities nationally within other trusts which could lead to the lack of revocation of driving licences on medical grounds, putting the patients and other road users at risk of death.",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,58,Male,Pedestrian

The conclusion of the inquest recorded that Natalie Christina Mountford died as a consequence of a road traffic collision.","Shortly after midnight on 18 December 2022, Natalie Christina Mountford was travelling from Shaftesbury to Sturminster Newton on the B3091 in her Vauxhall Astra, when she came across a single vehicle road traffic collision in the St James’ Common area: a Vauxhall Corsa, driven by [REDACTED], had lost control on ice that was present on the B3091 and collided with one or both verges, coming to rest in the opposing lane, with the front of the vehicle pointing into the verge. Ms Mountford came to [REDACTED] assistance, and invited her to sit in the rear of her Astra to keep warm while they awaited the Emergency Services. Ms Mountford remained outside of the vehicle. Shortly thereafter, [REDACTED], driving a Citroen Berlingo, again travelling from Shaftesbury in the direction of Sturminster Newton, tried to stop at the scene, but lost control of his vehicle on the ice that was present on the road. He elected to mount the verge to drive around the passenger side of Astra. As he did so, Ms Mountford walked around the front of her vehicle and she was struck by the Berlingo. Ms Mountford died at the scene as a consequence of the injuries she sustained.

Witnesses describe water flowing down the hill, with ice having formed as a consequence of the sub-zero temperatures that prevailed that night.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. There have been multiple road traffic collisions on this section of road within the seven years prior to Ms Mountford’s tragic death, including another fatality in 12/2017 caused by the presence of ice on this section of the road.

ii. When Dorset Council highways inspections take place, the inspectors will not consider or potentially investigate the possible source(s) of water running on or across a road. While it is accepted that there will often be occasions where the source of the water will be obvious (e.g. excessive rainfall), there may be occasions where the water is emanating from a source where remedial action can be taken to prevent the continued flow of water onto the road.

iii. Wessex Water do not appear to have a system in place to log and progress reports of potential leaks made directly to Wessex Water staff: a member of Dorset Council staff sent an email to a member of Wessex Water staff subsequent to the events of 18/12/2022 to alert them to the presence of a possible leak from the water pipe running underneath the B3091, which was causing water to flow down and across the road, warning of the risk that the water may freeze with the forecast temperatures. In preparation for the inquest, Wessex Water could not find the email sent by Dorset Council or any responses. In addition, though action was subsequently taken on 17/1/2023 to repair a leak at this site, it was part of Wessex Water’s routine leak inspection process, and not in response to the information received from Dorset Council.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. This section of the B3091 appears to be an accident “black spot”, with previous collisions likely to have occurred as a consequence of the presence of ice on the road, combined with a steep incline and a bend in the road;

ii. The presence of flowing water in a road is not considered and/or investigated by Dorset Council Highways Officers when conducting a highway inspection, leading to a risk that remedial action to stem the flow may not be taken, further leading to the continued presence of flowing water on a road. The presence of water itself could cause or contribute to a road traffic collision, but if the water were to freeze in sub-zero temperatures, the risk of a collision increases further;

iii. There would appear to be no process in place at Wessex Water to log and action reports made directly to staff of water leaks onto a highway, or if a process is in existence it would appear not to be robust. The risk is that such reports may be “lost”, with the necessary work not undertaken, leaving water flowing from a leak on the highway, with the subsequent risk outlined above.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,45,Female,Pedestrian

Upon the 20 July 2021, Kyle James Goater was travelling along Moor Road away from Ilkley, when his motor vehicle in good working order, approached a rising crest in the road which reduced his visibility of the road ahead. The road continued into a dip where a parked vehicle stood in a layby adjacent to the carriageway, on the offside. Unbeknown to Mr Goater an RAC van was stationary within the lane travelled by him indicating to turn right into the layby. Upon reaching the crest of the road Mr Goater became aware of the stationary RAC van, and braked to avoid a collision, which could not be avoided. As a result of the collision between Mr Goater’s car and the RAC van, a third vehicle travelling in the opposite direction became involved in the collision. Following the collision Mr Goater remained initially unable to free himself from his car, having suffered chest injuries which impacted upon his ability to breathe freely. The Ambulance Service was called to attend the scene, and whilst awaiting the arrival of a resource allocated to the incident, Mr Goater suffered a cardiac arrest: CPR was initially administered by the police personnel prior to the attendance of the ambulance crew, and then continued by a paramedic, which failed to revive Mr Goater; with his death being certified at 18:58 hours at the collision scene that day.","Kyle is a 25-year-old young man who resides alone in Keighley.

On 20 July, Kyle was the driver of a MGZS motor vehicle travelling from Ilkley towards Menston. As he crested the brow of a hill he collided with two separate vehicles. Kyle's vehicle sustained substantial damage.

Police officers from Bradford Road's Policing attended the report of this collision. Initially Kyle was talking and mobilising at the scene of the incident. Kyle then began to complain of chest pain. His breathing then became shallow and he went into arrest. CPR was commenced by officers on scene.

CPR continued until paramedics arrived on scene, they then took over. The paramedics continued CPR, until life was pronounced extinct at 18:58 hrs.","As the deceased was travelling in his motor vehicle approaching the brow of the hill on Moor Road controlled by a speed limit of 50 mph, no sign was in place to provide a warning as to a layby situated at the bottom of a dip in the road which was unforeseen by the deceased. At the bottom of the dip a vehicle was indicating to turn right into the layby, which the deceased travelling in the same traffic lane was not able to avoid, an inevitable collision occurred and as a result of such collision the deceased lost his life.
Had the layby been situated elsewhere or signposted well in advance of the crest of the hill it is likely that sufficient warning to an oncoming vehicle would have been provided in time to enable awareness of an oncoming vehicle and a reduction in speed from 50 mph.",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,25,Male,Driver

Cummings,Bedfordshire and Luton,"Chief Executive, East of England Ambulance Service","On 08 June 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lucas Tyler Pollard aged 14. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 January 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Lucas Tyler Pollard was aged 14 at the time of his death on the 1 June 2023. He had been given a new electric moped the day before. He had no prior experience of riding the moped. It was in sound mechanical order although the tyres were significantly underinflated. It was not designed to carry pillion passengers. He went out to ride it with a friend in the early hours of the 1 June 2023 in Leighton Buzzard. It was dry and there was very little other traffic. He was driving east along Leighton Road and his friend was riding pillion when the bike tilted to the right (offside) and then struck a sign post at approximately 20 miles per hour. He sustained very severe injuries to his chest, liver, spleen and pelvis and suffered catastrophic internal haemorrhage. A category 1 ambulance with a target response time of 7 minutes was dispatched from Luton Ambulance Station. It was known that the journey time would be in excess of 20 minutes. A critical care clinician considered the deployment of an air ambulance. That had an estimated journey time of greater than 40 minutes and was not dispatched. There was a rapid response vehicle based at the Leighton Buzzard Ambulance station with an estimated response of 3 minutes. That was dispatched by the computer aided dispatch system but then cancelled by a dispatcher as it would contravene East of England Ambulance Service End of Shift Policy. Deployment of the rapid response vehicle would have enabled aid to be given to Lucas much before the arrival of the ambulance from Luton. There was no discussion between the critical care clinician and the dispatcher. However, I found that the multiple injuries suffered by Lucas during the collision were catastrophic and meant that he would not survive the collision whatever aid had been provided.","Lucas Tyler Pollard was aged 14 when he died at the Luton and Dunstable University Hospital. He had been driving his new electric moped at about 1.30 am on 1 June 2023 when he collided with street furniture and sustained catastrophic unsurvivable injuries. He had no prior experience of riding the moped. A nearby resident heard the collision and went to his aid and called emergency services. The call recording illustrates the first-aider's increasing concern as Lucas deteriorated. Lucas can be heard in the background very clearly to be deteriorating rapidly and significantly. A Category 1 (C1) ambulance was dispatched followed by another as there were two casualties. C1 reflects an emergency response travelling with blue lights and sirens. The EEAST uses a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system which also automatically dispatched a solo paramedic in a rapid response vehicle (RRV). Fire co-responders were also deployed. A General Broadcast (GB) was not made. A GB is an alert to any other nearby resources who might possibly assist. EEAST policy requires a GB where there are no nearby resources. The first ambulance sent was based at the Luton ambulance station meaning it was greater than 20 minutes away. The second ambulance was also greater than 20 minutes away. The target response time for a C1 ambulance is an average of 7 minutes and 15 minutes for 90% of calls. It was known at the time of dispatch that it would greatly exceed the target time. A Critical Care Dispatcher was aware of the call and nature and considered deploying a Critical Care Team (CCT) but opted to let the crew from the first ambulance to assess and report. This was despite the crew being at least 20 minutes away. The nearest CCT was 42 minutes away by air. It was night which presents difficulties in safe landing etc. It was accepted on reflection that the CCT should have been sent. The RRV was 3 minutes from the scene. The proximity of the RRV was not revealed in the EEAST Serious Incident Investigation Report but emerged during questioning. The RRV was dispatched by the CAD but then immediately cancelled by a dispatcher due to the Trust's End of Shift Policy seemingly without regard to the actuality of the situation, that the two dispatched ambulances were more than 20 minutes away, a CCT was not dispatched and that a RRV 3 minutes away could have rendered essential aid. The End of Shift Policy limits the calls crews can be dispatched to within the last one hour and last 30 minutes of their shift. The coding allocated to Lucas did not permit the RRV to be sent. As mentioned above, there was clear evidence through the call of Lucas's markedly deteriorating condition. There appears to have been no coding reassessment. The Critical Care Dispatcher and the ""routine"" dispatcher were not in the same location but could see each other's entries into the computer system in real time as they were made. There was no direct dialogue between them. There was no evidence of a dynamic overview reassessment of the situation as it progressed. Had there been, it is possible, likely even, that the RRV would have been deployed. Medical evidence was clear Lucas would not have survived but that was not known at the time of the call.","(1) That a Critical Care Team was not dispatched immediately given the serious nature of the call and the likely lack of clinical information for some considerable time, i.e. waiting for the land ambulance, known to be more than 20 minutes away, to arrive and assess.

(2) That the End of Shift Policy was applied without evidence of an ongoing reassessment of the situation and the RRV, positioned only 3 minutes from the incident, was consequently not deployed.

(3) There was clear evidence from the 999 call both from the caller and the obvious deterioration of Lucas from sounds in the background, but that did not prompt a review of the management of the incident by EEAST.

(4) While the medical evidence after consideration of the clinical presentation and the post-mortem examination was clear that Lucas would not have survived, at the time of the call that was not and could not be known.

Lees,The Black Country Jurisdiction,Sandwell Highways; National Highways Agency,On 4/10/23 I commenced an investigation into the death of PAUL ANDREW FREAR aged 45 years who died on 22/9/23. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23/1/24. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision.,"On 22/9/23 Mr Frear passed away at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham from injuries sustained in a road traffic collision on 21/9/23. The collision occurred on the A457 Tollhouse Way, Smethwick at the junction with the B4135 Rolfe Street. CCTV revealed that Mr Frear was a pedestrian waiting at a crossing area, when he entered the carriageway whilst the pedestrian lights were showing red and collided with a vehicle travelling in lane 2.","1. During the inquest I received evidence from the West Midlands Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit. Tollhouse Way is classified as the A457 and runs parallel to the B4169 High Street, Smethwick. Tollhouse Way is a dual carriageway and runs in a general north to south direction. The majority of the carriageway consists of two lanes in both directions and it is governed by a 40mph speed limit. The collision took place in the northbound carriageway at a set of traffic lights at the junction with the B4135 Rolfe Street where Mr Frear was waiting to cross the road as a pedestrian.
2. At the point of the collision the northbound carriageway separates into three distinctive marked lanes. Lanes 1 and 2 are for traffic intending to continue straight on and lane 3 is for traffic intending to turn right into Rolfe Street. On the day of and immediately preceding the collision, traffic in lane 3, immediately next to Mr Frear was stationary and held by a red filter traffic light situated directly above Mr Frear. However, traffic travelling in lanes 1 and 2 were able to continue straight ahead and were directed by a green traffic light.
3. Mr Frear entered the carriageway when the pedestrian control panel next to him was showing red indicating ‘do not cross’ and collided with a vehicle in lane 2 travelling correctly in accordance with a green light.
4. It is accepted that Mr Frear may have been distracted by using his mobile phone and/or influenced by pedestrians crossing from the opposite direction.
5. My concern is that the design of this junction means that it is not obvious to a pedestrian that the only place to look for indications as to whether it is safe to cross the road is to their left. There are no such indicators on the opposite side of the carriageway which is ordinarily where a pedestrian would be looking. The signals were situated immediately to the left of where Mr Frear was stood/where any pedestrian would be standing.
6. Within the police report the collision investigator (who visited the scene) states as follows; I do however find the layout very confusing with the right turn filter lane (lane 3) not being separated from the main carriageway a pedestrian is faced with stationary traffic. If a pedestrian chose to look up to their right they would be presented with a red traffic light and the only indication that it is still not safe to cross is the pedestrian controls to their immediate left. The green light for lanes 1 and 2 is not visible to pedestrians and there is no pedestrian light indication on the opposite side. I share this concern.
7. Coroner understands from the police that there were two previous incidents at this location which occurred prior to the changes resulting in the current road layout. Coroner also understands Sandwell Highways have completed safety reviews and processes throughout the design, implementation and post installation of the junction design.
8. Whilst the current road layout may be legal, the death of Mr Frear highlights the safety issue for pedestrians present at this junction crossing from BOTH sides and highlights that the signage for pedestrians is not clear enough and there is a risk of further deaths now and in the future.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,45,Male,Pedestrian

At approximately 07:28 the bus driver did not react to the presence of an articulated lorry which was undertaking a right hand turn from a haulage depot on the nearside of the carriageway onto the westbound carriageway of the A47. The bus collided at speed with the lorry trailer which was sat across the eastbound carriageway. Extensive damage was caused to both vehicles and sadly Mr Chapman suffered significant and unsurvivable traumatic injuries. His death was confirmed at the scene by a paramedic at 08:26.,"One of the two vehicles involved in the collision was a double decker service bus travelling a scheduled route between Peterborough and Norwich, a distance of approximately 80 miles. The bus was not fitted with passenger seatbelts. I heard evidence that although since 01.10.01 seatbelts are required to be fitted in all new buses (this vehicle was on a '63' plate) there is an exemption where such vehicles are designed for urban use with standing passengers.

Whilst this particular route required the bus to travel from/to and stop off in 5-6 urban centres the majority of the journey took place on a major A route through rural areas. The speed of the bus at the point of collision was approximately 53 mph. Both the bus driver and an upper deck passenger were killed in the collision.

Whilst there was no evidence that either death would have been prevented by the wearing of seatbelts a number of other passengers were injured in the collision.

I am concerned where buses are undertaking journeys such as this through predominantly rural locations and subject to the national speed limit without seatbelts being required there is an obvious risk of death to passengers if collisions occur, particularly at high speed.",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,76,Male,Other

The conclusion of the inquest was death due to road traffic collision and the medical cause of death was 1a multiple injuries.,"Walter Faulder BEM was an 88 year old gentleman who lived alone in Wigton, Cumberland. He had recently been discharged from hospital.

On Saturday 10 December 2022, Walter's daughter visited his address and there was a Cranston’s shopping bag next to his chair. He said he had got the bus to Orton Grange (where the shop is) and back which raised alarm bells to his daughter. She asked him not to do this journey again as it is unsafe. Walter stated that he believes there is a pelican crossing to assist him crossing the road (A595). This is not the case at Orton Grange.

On Tuesday 13 December 2022, Walter has got the 400 bus at 16:10 hours from Wigton and got off at Orton Grange. Walter has forgotten his wallet and crossed the road to the middle island and continued onto the south-west carriageway. He then collided with a vehicle, causing him to fall into the chevrons in the middle of the road. At the time of the collision it was nearly dark and the road was busy with a steady flow of traffic in both directions moving at normal speed.

Walter was given first aid at scene, however he was pronounced deceased at scene in the rear of the ambulance at 17:20 hours.","(1) Walter seems to have believed that as a pedestrian he had right of way, he may have been a bit confused having forgotten his wallet however the day before the collision he referred to the illuminated pole in the central refuge as a Belisha beacon.

The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not been heard.,"Ms Amal Mohamed Ahmed died on the A5 southbound Little Brickhill at or adjacent to the point where the A5 joins the ""off"" slip road. She appears to have been using a satnav directing her to Queensway, Bletchley. She entered the exit to the off slip road and drove the wrong way down the slip road, ultimately colliding with a vehicle travelling at speed on the A5 head on. Ms Ahmed died at the scene. The driver of the other vehicle died later at the John Radcliffe Hospital. A passenger of one of the vehicles required critical care treatment and suffered life threatening and changing injuries.","The exit point of the A5 ""off"" slip road at the Little Brickhill junction is wide. The signage indicating No Entry appears to be inadequate as there are two No Entry signs which are widely spaced at the junction. One is positioned to appear to forbid entry to the road over the bridge leading over the A5 and does not obviously relate to the slip road. The second is positioned such that it obliquely faces the road over the bridge and would not be visible to a driver turning right onto the slip road until they had completed the manoeuvre placing them at risk. There is a No Right Turn sign as the junction is approached. There is also No Entry in large white letters at the mouth of the slip road junction, however, this may be (1) obscured by vehicles leaving the slip road and (2) the junction is unlit and was said by a witness as being ""pitch black"". After the collision attending police officers saw three further vehicles perform exactly the same manoeuvre as Ms Ahmed and attempt to travel down the slip road in the wrong direction. Local residents have contacted police and complained that it is a very common occurrence for drivers to mistakenly travel down the slip road in the wrong direction. The slip road is long and allows for the build up of considerable speed in turn facilitating what the police describe as a high energy impact. Following the collision, large temporary No Entry signs were positioned at the slip road junction. They were quickly removed apparently because the original signs were deemed to comply with necessary regulations. That seems wholly irrelevant to me because drivers are clearly commonly not seeing the signs because of the large numbers who mistakenly drive the wrong way onto the slip road.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 October 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

• Joanne died from multiple unsurvivable injuries sustained in a road traffic collision on the A141 Isle of Ely Way in Cambridgeshire when the motorcycle on which she was a passenger was in collision with a tractor whose view of the road was obscured by overhanging trees and vegetation.","On 2 August 2020, Joanne Constable was the passenger on a motorbike which collided with a trailer being pulled by a tractor as it turned right out of a field onto the A141 Isle of Ely Way near Wimblington, Cambridgeshire. Due to vegetation growth of trees and bushes on the verge of the public highway, the tractor driver’s line of sight was obstructed, making it impossible to assess whether there was adequate time and distance to safely exit the junction. Consequently, the motorbike’s path was blocked by the trailer and the rider could not take evasive action in time to avoid the collision. Mrs Constable was thrown from the motorbike in the collision, sustaining multiple injuries and she was pronounced deceased at [REDACTED] hours.","• In the course of evidence from the local authority’s highway maintenance manager, I heard concerning testimony as to the apparent lack of systems and processes in place to record complaints or reports of hazards or defects with the highway. Consequently, there seemed to be no way of identifying which reports had been actioned or inspected and even when the system indicated that an inspection had taken place and led to a recommendation for work to be carried out within a statutory timeframe, there was no information available on the system to show if or when any work was carried out, much less to what specification.
• On the evidence I heard, the circumstances prevailing at the entrance to Bypass Field onto the A141 Isle of Ely Way are replicated at many points across the county and therefore, should those with a statutory responsibility to maintain the highways, including verges, at public cost be unaware of the status of reported hazards or defects, there is a clear risk of future deaths occurring due to those with the responsibility not taking steps to remedy the problem and more fatal road traffic collisions occurring.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,52,Female,Other

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

On the 30 October 2022 Terence Charles Scott Duncan died on the A4 Bath Road, Slough having been run over by a lorry. He had deliberately started to pass under the skeleton-trailer in front of the trailer wheels in order to cross the road when the lorry moved off.","On 30 October 2022 an articulated lorry was travelling through Slough on the A4. The traffic was very heavy due to a closure of the M4. The lorry trailer was an unloaded trailer designed to carry a shipping container.

The lorry moved off from a set of traffic lights and its route was blocked for a few seconds by another vehicle. This caused the trailer to obstruct a pedestrian crossing.

Mr Duncan was crossing the road and made the decision to duck under the skeleton of the trailer rather than walking around the vehicle. He had a clear view through the trailer unit when he did this. Sadly the lorry moved off before Mr Duncan reached the far side of the road and he was run over by the rear nearside tyres.","I heard evidence regarding the requirement for sideguards or underrun protection devices to be installed on certain heavy goods vehicles. The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 set out the legal requirements.

I note that the official government website states that sideguards or lateral protection devices are there to reduce the likelihood of injury to unprotected road users when struck by a vehicle travelling in a forward direction.

I was informed that the type of trailer involved in this inquest was an extendable trailer and therefore its construction was in compliance with the Regulations as long as the requirements were met when the trailer was in its shortest configuration.

The sideguard on this trailer was only 50cm long whereas the distance between the wheels of the cab unit and trailer wheels was 3 metres when extended. The trailer was extended despite not being loaded with a shipping container at the time. There was therefore a very significant gap between the end of the sideguards and front of the following wheels.

I am concerned that there is no lesser risk posed to pedestrians or cyclists by an extendable trailer than that posed by a fixed trailer of the same length which would have been required to have a more comprehensive sideguard device installed.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,48,Male,Pedestrian

An inquest was opened and adjourned on the 17 January 2023 and a final inquest took place on the 12 and 13 October 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

“Harry Colledge died on the 2 January 2023 at the Royal Preston Hospital as a result of injuries he sustained having been thrown from his bicycle. Mr Colledge was an otherwise fit and healthy man who was a keen cyclist. On the 2 January 2023 he was cycling along Island Lane, Winmarleigh when his bicycle entered a crack defect in the carriageway, causing him to be thrown from his bicycle. This defect had been identified to the relevant Council in September 2022 and the subject of highway inspections on the 15 and 26 September 2022, involving six highways team operatives. Despite the Council's notification of the defect and its approximate location, these inspections did not identify the defect which caused Mr Colledge's injuries and thus a dangerous hazard had remained on Island Lane from 9 September 2022 to 2 January 2023.”","Mr Harry Colledge was a fit and active 84 year old man. On 2 January 2023 he was cycling his bicycle with a friend, a common activity for Mr Colledge. He was riding along Island Lane, Winmarleigh when his bicycle entered a crack defect in the carriageway causing him to be thrown from his bicycle and sustain injuries which caused his death. The crack defect in question had been seen by local residents and members of the local Parish Council on 9 September 2022. They took photographs of the defect and others on the road, and reported them to the Highways department at the Lancashire County Council. The senior manager who received the photographs tasked others to inspect the road and repair the defects. Four Highways operatives attended the road in two vehicles on 15 September 2022. The road was driven in its entirety and no defects were noticed or repaired. A second, scheduled inspection took place by Highways inspectors on 26 September 2022. This also involved two operatives conducting a driven inspection and neither observed the crack defect which caused Mr Colledge’s collision. Consequently the crack was not repaired and remained hazardous in the roadway at the time of Mr Colledge’s incident and death.","1. Highway operatives gave evidence that their inspections primarily consider the impact of defects upon cars using that road surface. All gave evidence of no specific training or experience with regards to identifying defects which present a hazard to bicycle users, when expert evidence indicated that the Council’s statutory duty required reasonable steps to protect all road users which includes cyclists. The evidence of Council witnesses was unanimous that since Mr Colledge’s death, there has been no additional training, updates, briefings or policy reviews to offer further knowledge of operatives in safely assessing defects which pose risks to cyclists or road users other than car drivers. I consider there is a risk of future deaths of all cyclists if Highways Operatives and inspectors are not able to identify defects on a carriageway which present a risk to cyclists as opposed to simply car users.

2. Evidence from a Highways Expert, [REDACTED], explained that Island Lane is part of peat/moss road which is the subject of natural movement when it rains. The water is absorbed by the peat/moss and swells caused the tarmac to move then it compacts when it dries and the road surface lowers, causing cracks. [REDACTED]’s evidence was that there is natural movement but these defects rarely get better, only worse. I am concerned that the road surfacing on Island Lane, Winmarleigh will continue to be the subject of natural movement and the present surfacing is hampered by the geography of the location including camber of the road. I consider there is a risk of future deaths to road users if the surfacing of this road is not adequately maintained. Whilst the inspection schedule timescales enacted by the Council are considered to be appropriate, I consider there is a risk of future deaths due to the present surfacing and underlying geological features of this road if inspections are unable to reasonably identify hazardous defects.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,84,Male,Cyclist

Narrative conclusion

On 17 August 2022 Adam Connolly Stuyvesant was involved in a minor, single vehicle road traffic collision, on the Marlborough Road at Pewsey Wiltshire. He was admitted to The Great Western Hospital Emergency Department, Marlborough Road, Swindon, where in addition to minor injuries he was diagnosed with an avulsion fracture from the lateral malleolus in the left ankle. Adam was given a plastic boot to wear which immobilised the ankle. At that time, the DVT risk assessment had it been carried out would only have taken account of Adam's size, not the ankle immobility, which carried a risk of deep vein thrombosis.
On 22 August 2022 Adam collapsed at Unit 31 Blackworth Industrial Estate, Highworth, Swindon and despite best efforts at resuscitation, died. The post mortem confirmed that death was due to the immobilisation of the left ankle allowing a deep vein thrombosis to develop which led to pulmonary embolus.

The investigation has not yet concluded and the inquest has not been heard.,"Jessica was a 15 year old pupil who was a passenger travelling on the school coach from her home address in Chester to West Kirby Grammar School when the bus was involved in a one vehicle road traffic collision. Jessica and the coach driver died in the incident. There were over 50 students on board.
At approximately 08:03 hours a road traffic collision involving this bus has taken place on the northbound carriageway of the M53 motorway between junctions 5 and 4. This is in the Eastham area of Wirral, Merseyside. The motorway at this point is a generally straight stretch of road with three lanes and a hard shoulder in each direction that is separated by a corrugated metal barrier on the central reservation. The collision occurred on the northbound carriageway and this is bordered by a sloped embankment to the nearside that contains shrubbery, trees and general overgrowth. The coach was travelling in lane 2 of 3 (the central lane) and passing another vehicle to its nearside. Having completed this passing manoeuvre, the coach began to move back into lane 1 of 3 (the left hand lane). However, it continued to veer gradually towards the nearside. It has crossed the hard shoulder before leaving the carriageway altogether, where it has entered the embankment and into the overgrowth. It has continued forwards and up the embankment before striking a large tree which has then resulted in the vehicle lurching to its right before barrel rolling down the embankment and back onto the carriageway coming to rest predominantly in the hard shoulder.
CCTV from within coach shows that prior to the collision, the driver slumps/falls to his left hand side prior to the vehicle leaving the motorway and the collision occurring. During the course of the vehicle rolling down the embankment, a passenger on the coach, Jessica Evie Baker, was partially ejected from the vehicle and became trapped underneath it. This has resulted in catastrophic instantly fatal injuries. Jessica was pronounced deceased at scene by attending paramedics at 09:01. The driver was also pronounced deceased at scene at 08:50.
A roads policing investigation is ongoing – the court has directed evidence to be obtained and will review the investigation on 20 March 2024.","This was a school commuter coach travelling on a motorway. It was constructed after 2001 and will have had seat belts fitted. Review of CCTV does not show the seatbelts were being used.

This coach had secondary school children on board. Some of the pupils, those below 14 years of age, would be expected to wear seatbelts under driver supervision.

The driver did not appear to be wearing a seat belt.

A distinction should be drawn between school buses in built-up areas and school commuter coaches travelling a distance using A roads and the motorway network with regard to the availability and use of seatbelts.

He suffered from dissociative episodes where he had at times harmed himself and others but otherwise was engaging and well-liked by those who met him. He was also in the process of seeing a neurologist given a family history of Huntington’s disease. He was admitted to hospital as a 17 year old and transferred to adult services on reaching 18. A package was put in place for him to be transferred to the community with support from a private care provider with two members of staff being with him 24 hours a day in March 2021. He initially did well and had also been seen by a psychologist from Kent and Medway Complex Autism service and was undergoing some therapy with a view to reducing his risk and stabilisation of his presentation prior to considering any long term trauma work. He had a deterioration in his mental health in July 2021 and was admitted under the provisions of the Mental Health Act to St. Martin’s hospital in Canterbury.

He returned home in August and the dissociative incidents continued but were manageable until the end of the year when there were concerns over the increasing frequency and risks. In January 2022 he had taken himself onto train tracks near his house and was taken to the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital and assessed by liaison psychiatry who did not consider he had an acute treatable mental health problem. He stayed at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital whilst discussions ensued between the agencies involved in his care including Kent County Council, Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, Avondale, the Integrated Care Board and East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust. Attempts were made to obtain a specialist bed and a Mental Health Act assessment on 28 January 2022 deemed him not to be detainable under the provisions of the Mental Health Act although the possibility of an informal bed was suggested as an interim solution. Ultimately it was decided that he should be discharged home with an increased package of care and now 3 carers.

He went home on 3 February and on 11 February he assaulted two members of staff and ran to the nearby train station placing himself on the tracks where sadly a train coming into the station hit him. He died from his injuries at the scene.","1. In the course of hearing the evidence it was clear that young adults with autism who were at risk of self-harm as well as harm to others have very limited options in terms of placements where their needs can be met. A bespoke placement had been carefully created by those involved in Ben’s care but this had taken several months to arrange. This arrangement had worked well and all involved tried to make it a success and for quite some time it was. It was however recognised that there may come a time in the future when his risks to himself and others would mean an alternative placement would be needed.

2. When Ben’s risks to himself increased further there were no suitable beds available where he could be cared for in an environment which could meet his needs. He spent several days in an acute hospital bed despite being medically fit for discharge which although, essentially a place of safety, was totally unsuited to his needs. This stay continued whilst discussions ensued regarding where he should be placed. A bed in an acute psychiatric ward was considered but not deemed appropriate to meet his needs and as there were no specialist beds available he was discharged back to his home with increased support as the best option available. Had a bed been available in a specialist unit it is likely that he would not have died when he did.

3. In the evidence provided it became clear that a lot of units where a specialist bed may have been available had been closed in the past due to concerns about the level of care following a number of investigations. This has led to a system whereby locally and nationally there are limited options for those requiring care relating to both the management of autism and self-harm or harm to others, particularly when there is an urgent need for increased support.

• Photographs taken of the scene show that notwithstanding the heavy goods vehicle had stopped as far to the left as possible, the vehicle still took up nearly all of the southbound carriageway which bends to the right at this point.
• Heavy goods vehicles frequently park on the southbound carriageway in order to unload, and witnesses have described this as “...an accident waiting to happen.”

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased died of multiple injuries as a result of an accident.,"Shortly before 0600 hours on 14 February 2018, the deceased was driving a British Airways Renault Kangoo across an uncontrolled crossing of Taxiway C at Heathrow Terminal 5. The uncontrolled crossing ran between stands 546/547 and 556/557. Once he had entered that crossing he had to proceed and was not permitted to stop. About 20 metres from the end of the uncontrolled crossing (which was 105 metres in length) a Heathrow Airport Ltd (“HAL”) HiLux vehicle travelling south along Taxiway C at 40 mph or more struck his Kangoo on the passenger side, causing the deceased fatal injuries.

Bennett,Birmingham and Solihull,"The Rt Hon Mark Harper MP, Secretary of State for Transport - Department for Transport; Mayor of the West Midlands, Chair - West Midlands Combined Authority; Chief Executive - Collaborative Mobility UK",On 12 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of MUSTAFA NADEEM. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest.,"On 6/12/22 Mustafa was riding an e-scooter to school on the pavement on the B4128, approaching the traffic island with Belchers Lane, Bordesley Green when at 7:58am he inadvertently collided with a pedestrian and fell into the path of a bus that was travelling at slow speed. He suffered fatal injuries and was confirmed deceased at the scene. The e-scooter was authorised for use in Birmingham as part of a national pilot scheme and users were required to have a valid motor-vehicle driving licence and be aged over 18. The e-scooter being used by Mustafa had been unlocked by a 14-year-old friend via an 'app' on his mobile phone.

The medical cause of death was confirmed at post-mortem examination: Multiple injuries.

The formal conclusion as to the death: Death was a consequence of a road traffic collision.","Hire e-scooters are only available as part of a national pilot scheme. The scheme is implemented locally. Guidance to the providers of hire e-scooters is currently limited to Department for Transport guidance. There is no regulatory body.

Hire e-scooters are legally classed as motor vehicles and require the user to have a driving licence. In this case it was also a licensing condition that users were aged 18+.

The deceased was using a hire e-scooter to travel to school despite having no driving licence and being aged 12. The account used to access the hire e-scooter belonged to a friend who had no driving licence, was aged 14, and was regularly using an under 16s bank account to pay for rides.

I heard evidence that Department for Transport guidance requires a driving licence, age and identity check when an account is created on a mobile device. However, users can easily transfer the account to another device and no further identity and age check is required. In this case the account was originally created on an adult’s mobile phone, but quickly and easily transferred to a child’s mobile phone and payment switched to an under 16s bank account. Department for Transport guidance did not require the e-scooter provider to undertake any age or identity checks at the point of transfer.

I heard evidence that the providers of hire e-scooters have no ability to detect if a child’s bank account is being used to pay for rides. In this case, had the provider been able to detect the use of a child’s bank account it would have alerted them to illegal use on the account and action could have been taken.

I heard evidence from the head teacher of the deceased’s school that from the outset of the hire e-scooter pilot scheme pupils riding e-scooters illegally was instantly problematic. Upon it being known the school would seize e-scooters pupils would simply abandon them at the end of the road. Despite education and the facts of this death being known, children from the same school and other schools continued to use hire e-scooters illegally.

I heard evidence that education is paramount to safe use of hire e-scooters and this requires a collaborative approach.

In my view the use of hire e-scooters is not analogous to the supply of other motor vehicles. During the evidence the point was made that the manufacturers of cars/motorbikes do not undertake any checks once the vehicle is with the customer. This can be contrasted to hire e-scooters being readily available, do not involve any face-to-face contact with a responsible adult at the point of unlocking, and are quickly accessed via mobile phone ‘apps’. Children are likely to have many ‘apps’ on their mobile phones and the legal significance of a motor vehicle ‘app’ is likely to be diluted and/or not appreciated at all.

In summary:

My principal concern is the evidence demonstrates the ease in which children can (illegally) use hire e-scooters.

My specific concerns are the evidence demonstrates current hire e-scooter precautions, and education/information, is not effective in preventing children from (illegally) using hire e-scooters.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Kaius John Paul Tutt died on 14 October 2022 on the A391 between the Scredra and Carclaze roundabouts near St Austell Cornwall from trauma after Kaius attempted an overtaking manoeuvre whilst riding his motorcycle and collided with a car being driven on the opposite carriageway.

Inquest conclusion – Road traffic collision","Vivien was the driver of a Ford Focus motor vehicle travelling west along Old Oundle Road, Wittering at about 10:35 on 3 September 2022. The vehicle failed to negotiate a sharp left hand bend, left the carriageway to the offside before it entered a pond and became submerged upside down in water.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 March 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Incident.

Box 3 of the record of inquest read:

On the evening of 27 August 2021 Rebecca Lisa KIRBY was out socialising. She misjudged the traffic on Lowgate, Hull and ran into the path of an oncoming vehicle. The vehicle was travelling at 23 miles per hour however the way Ms Kirby landed resulted in significant head injuries, causing her to become immediately unresponsive. Despite many people coming to her aid to offer advanced life support, she remained in cardiac arrest. She was transported to Hull Royal Infirmary where she was declared deceased.

One of the findings of fact stated: Miss Kirby had crossed behind a passing car which would obscure any oncoming vehicles' view of her. In addition to lights, taxis and other pedestrians in the vicinity.

His medical cause of death was recorded as:
1a Intracranial haemorrhage
1b Road Traffic Incident","Miss Kirby was out socialising with friends. She had consumed alcohol and was in an area of Hull known for its night time economy. She became separated from her friends and after looking in one location crossed a road. She misjudged the crossing and despite seeing the vehicle still attempted to cross the road. When struck by the car she landed on her head causing catastrophic injuries. Police witnessed the incident and were immediately on scene. Throughout the advanced life support she remained in cardiac arrest, without a pulse or signs of breathing. She was conveyed to Hull Royal Infirmary where CPR was ceased and she was declared dead.","(1) On a Friday and Saturday night the Lowgate area of Hull city is exceptionally busy with people enjoying the night time economy. As such many are in drink. The area of Lowgate is open to traffic, it is also the location of a taxi rank. There is only one crossing facility (aside from at either end of the road), the road narrows significantly at one end.

(2) Police raised concerns as follows:
- The road remaining open during a Friday and Saturday night.
- The number of pedestrians using the area.
- Many people in drink in the area having to cross the road.
- The road is a 30 mph.
- Lights of vehicles are distracting
- The location of the taxi rank, pedestrians having to navigate around the parked taxis, some with lights on, to enter the road. Taxis do 3 point turns in the road and any vehicle doing this is a danger to pedestrians.

(3) Evidence was heard one doorman working in the area who stated “Having worked at the same location for some time, the area where the bars are on Lowgate is an accident waiting to happen. Members of the public are leaving the bars in a drunken state and they just wander into the road to cross, many of them not even looking for traffic on the road. Some vehicles travel down Lowgate far too fast given the evening activity” and another doorman stated “the road and both the footpaths at the location of the collision occurred on Lowgate are both very narrow. There is also a taxi rank outside O’Leary’s which doesn’t help as taxis were parked there at the time of the collision. I have seen numerous near misses over the years I have worked in the area. It is no exaggeration to say that there are between six to twelve incidents each night between cars and pedestrians, one thing which does not help and is also dangerous are taxis which do U turns in the road once they have collected their fare”.

(4) The police had previously made recommendations and further felt that closing Lowgate to all through traffic on a Friday and Saturday evening, making Lowgate a total no stopping zone on an evening between certain hours, moving the location of a taxi rank onto nearby Alfred Gelder Street.

(5) I note the statement from the local authority listed
- They have erected 2 speed signs since the incident. Bearing in mind that this incident occurred with a vehicle travelling well within the limits, traffic is the concern not limited to the speed of vehicles.
- The council was looking at developing a document that reviewed speed limits for the whole of the city centre. Lowgate has a special reason for being an area of concern and should be looked at as a priority and not in conjunction with all other city centre streets.
- That engagement with the council's public transport department has commenced with the intention to relocate the taxi rank to Alfred Gelder Street “but this requires consultation with the Hackney Carriage Association”. No indication was given regarding what was being done to facilitate this.
- The council say that there are no resources to manage the road closure, despite acknowledging it is their responsibility. The fact the road is open at this time is a danger and I am concerned given the comments of the doormen that the danger is being underestimated.
- Crossing facilities had been looked at but could not be positioned within a suitable distance.

The concerns in relation to this junction, and the other junctions relate to:
1. The volume of traffic that the junctions must manage.

3. The speed limit in the vicinity of the junctions.

Concerns were also raised in relation to the planned extensive expansion/development of the area in the vicinity of the junction, including increased housing development, a proposed retail park, football site, as well as developments occurring more widely in the area which will lead to increased traffic, and that any proposed improvements to the junction are not required until prior to the occupation of the 39th dwelling on the site.

BOX 4 - Jury Questionnaire
*Delete as appropriate

1. Was Hannah suffering from a mental disorder on the morning of 3 February 2016?

2. Did she leave London in her vehicle and travel the following route (see attached map)?

3. Was she in her vehicle when it entered the water in Port Talbot Harbour?

4. Did she get out of the vehicle upon it entering the water?

5. Did she attempt to rescue herself from the confines of the harbour?

6. Did she drown during that attempt?

7. Did the inadequacies in the MPS investigation into Hannah’s disappearance possibly cause or contribute to her death?","In the evening of 3 February 2016 Hannah was reported missing by her flat mate and fiancé. The report was made to the MPS. It appeared Hannah had left London in her motorcar shortly after 11am that morning and had not been spoken to since around 10.30am.

It was reported that she had been acting out of character expressing delusional thoughts and ideas, specifically that she “hacked into a computer” and the “government were after her”.

Hannah’s case was considered by the Duty Inspector at Brixton police station towards the end of his shift that evening. He assessed Hannah as “medium risk” using the COMPACT risk assessment tool.

A LOW stop ACT was placed on Hannah’s vehicle on the Police National Computer by the investigating Police Constable. There was no specific instruction to place a Low ACT (as opposed to a Medium / High stop ACT) and no discussion about which priority to place on the said ACT. The available evidence established that ‘LOW’ would probably have been placed on the ACT by default.

Meanwhile Hannah had travelled in her vehicle down to Brighton, along the south coast as far as Exeter, and then north towards Weston Super Mare, before rejoining the M5.

A call from Avon and Somerset Police into the MPS shortly after 10.00pm notified them of an ANPR activation for Hannah’s vehicle inbound to Weston Super Mare. Avon and Somerset requested further details from the MPS.

A second call just over one hour later notified the MPS that the vehicle was heading back out towards the motorway and again requested further details from the MPS.

A third call from Gwent Police into the MPS shortly before 02.45am on 4 February 2016 made a similar request information in relation to the ACT instruction.

Hannah’s journey generated no fewer than 27 activations on the ANPR system, the last at about 03.25am in Margam, Port Talbot.

The ANPR Bureau were not contacted by the MPS during this time.

At around 03.25am Hannah entered the Port Talbot harbour site via a private road. Her body was found in the lock entrance to the harbour shortly after 9am on 4 February 2016 and her car located underwater in the harbour itself by South Wales Police divers.","(1) The evidence was clear that the most effective means of locating a missing person in Hannah’s position was to locate the vehicle in which it was assumed she was travelling;
(2) There was an apparent mismatch between the COMPACT risk assessment for Hannah graded as “medium” and the LOW stop priority instruction on ACT in relation to her vehicle.
(3) The evidence I and the jury heard was that there was no formal guidance, training, or protocols of any kind to assist with the dialogue between these two systems; instead, it was left to local custom and practice as to how to correlate any risk assessment with the priority instruction on the ACT, if at all.
(4) The preponderance of the evidence was that the LOW stop instruction was inappropriate in this case, but I was not directed to any document or guidance that would have assisted those responsible at the time for selecting the correct priority on the ACT.
(5) I have seen no evidence of any formal guidance, training, or protocols as to how these two critically important systems are meant to operate alongside one another safely, or at all.

His death was reported to the Coroner and an investigation commenced. A post-mortem examination performed by Dr Martin Goddard on 21 December 2021 provided the following cause of death:

1a Purulent bronchitis and bronchopneumonia

1b Multiple traumatic injuries

An inquest was opened on 9 March 2022 and the investigation concluded at the end of that inquest on 8 February 2023, which found:

Circumstances:

On 5 November 2021 Steven Easdale was struck by a car whilst crossing the B197 Digswell Hill. He sustained multiple injuries and was taken by ambulance to Addenbrookes Hospital. Despite treatment, Mr Easdale died on 12 December 2021. There was a central pedestrian island near to where Mr Easdale crossed the road but he did not use it. It was dark at the time Mr Easdale crossed, he was wearing dark clothing and the driver did not have time to react to his presence in the road and avoid the collision. The central pedestrian island near to where Mr Easdale crossed the road should have been illuminated. It was not in working order, however, and was therefore unlit. A nearby streetlamp was also not working and was unlit. Had the pedestrian island and streetlamp been illuminated it may have helped the driver to see Mr Easdale earlier and avoid the collision.

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death:

Road traffic collision","At the inquest I heard evidence from two police officers [REDACTED] of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire (BCH) Serious Collision Investigation Unit. They outlined that approximately 15 metres from where Mr Easdale crossed the road, there was a traffic island (or pedestrian refuge) with a bollard and streetlamp in place. The bollard on the island is made out of opaque white plastic and is designed to be illuminated from within. The time of the collision was around 5pm on a December afternoon meaning that this stretch of road was in deep darkness.

When the collision occurred on 5 November 2021, neither the illuminated bollard nor the streetlamp were in working order and were therefore unlit. Both officers from the collision unit gave evidence that this situation presented a danger to road users and pedestrians.

A Traffic Management Officer has brought this situation to the attention of Hertfordshire County Council, Highways England (now National Highways) and National Power Networks (now UK Power Networks).

Despite this, I heard evidence at the inquest that both the bollard and the streetlamp have still not been repaired and remain unlit even in the hours of darkness.

I was not able to say on the balance of probabilities that the lack of lighting on the pedestrian island contributed to Mr Easdale’s death as he was not using the crossing itself when he was struck. He crossed nearby, however, and it is possible that had there been illumination at that island the driver of the car would have seen him earlier and potentially avoided the collision.

Mutch,Greater Manchester South,Secretary of State for Health and Social Care; NHS England,"On 12 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson. The investigation concluded on 12 January 2023 and the conclusion was one of narrative: Died from injuries sustained in a road traffic collision where there was a delay in identifying the severity of the injuries sustained. The medical cause of death was 1a) Acute myocardial infarction; 1b) Multiple injury, acute bilateral subdural haematomas; 1c) Road traffic collision",Celia Sanderson was involved in a road traffic collision. She was then taken to Wythenshawe Hospital. There was a delay in triage due to demands on the emergency department. Triage did not pick up on her being a potential silver trauma case. A CT scan was not ordered at that time. She was triaged to be seen within 1 hour. Due to demands on the emergency department she was not seen by a clinician until approximately 6 hours after triage. This was not a senior clinician assessment due to staffing levels and demands on the department. The junior doctor found no significant injuries but asked for a more senior review. This was delayed due to the workload demands on the middle grade doctor. On assessment the middle grade doctor identified a CT scan was required. The CT scan was requested at 04:21. The scan was reviewed by a clinician at 07:00 before the radiology report itself was available. The actual report was delayed due to workload demands on the radiology registrar. It was identified that she had severe injuries from the road traffic collision and a transfer to a major trauma centre was required. Celia Sanderson began to deteriorate whilst further tests were undertaken and awaiting transfer. The further tests identified she had also sustained significant neurological damage from the road traffic collision. She continued to deteriorate and had an acute myocardial infarction. She died at Wythenshawe Hospital before she could be transferred.,"1. Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;

2. The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;

3. Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;

4. The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Female,Not known

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 7 February 2023.","At approximately 19.13 hours on 30 May 2021, the deceased was riding his Harley Davidson XL1200 motorcycle in a northerly direction along Coombe Road, Winterbourne Steepleton, Dorchester which has a speed limit of 60 mph. He was travelling at a speed of no more than 44 mph when he had just driven over the brow of a hill and his bike entered a 60 metre stretch of grass in the carriageway, which covered the entire width of the carriageway and had been there from at least approximately 18.00 hours that day. His motorcycle slipped on the grass, and he became separated from the motorcycle. He travelled into the pathway of an oncoming Ford Focus Titanium TDCI in the southbound carriageway of the road, which passed over him. He came to rest under the vehicle and sustained numerous significant and unsurvivable injuries.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. On 30 May 2021 a carpet of grass was obstructing the entire northbound carriageway of Coombe Road, Winterbourne Steepleton, Dorchester for a distance of 60 metres. This was described as dangerous and a hazard. On that day a road traffic collision occurred as a result of that hazard in which sadly Mr Wood died.

ii. There was evidence that the grass had been seen at approximately 18.00 hours by a member of the public driving on the other side of the road. The collision occurred at approximately 19.13 hours. Between 18.00 hours and 19.13 hours, 3 people working on a local farm transporting silage from a local field to the farm had seen the grass and had driven over it. Others may also have seen and/or driven over the grass.

iii. No one reported this obstruction in the road prior to the collision. Evidence was given that there is a legal requirement to remove or report any spillage if you cause it, but there is no obligation to report any hazard you see, which you have not caused.

iv. The owner of the farm, who was undertaking silage transfer in the area at the time, has said that since the incident, if there is any spillage or obstruction he or his employees come across, they will report it, so it can be cleared.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. That there is a lack of knowledge and/or understanding as to when people should report an obstruction in the road. I would request that consideration is given to making all road users aware of the dangers of obstructions in the road and to encourage them to report any hazard to the local police force or local authority so that it can be removed as soon as possible, or at least other road users be warned of the hazard to prevent a future death.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,61,Male,Other

Jayden Andrew Booroff died on 23 October 2020. The investigation concluded at the end of the 10-day inquest on 25 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was narrative,

Jayden’s use of illicit drugs and alcohol contributed heavily to his psychotic condition and if this had been addressed earlier, it may have made a difference to his health, wellbeing and treatment. More consideration should have been given to Jayden’s relevant family history and more weight should have been given to this alongside the diagnosis that his psychosis was triggered by drug and alcohol use only. The layout of The Linden Centre in particular the areas around the main doors was not appropriate for ensuring the safety of its more vulnerable patients. Procedures around the use and allocation of Pinpoint alarms was inadequate. The policy recording and reporting absconsions from The Linden Centre was not clear enough and led to a lack of awareness and a delay in addressing the flaws in the system. Responsibility for Jayden was not in line with policy and this contributed to a reduction in observation levels and inconsistencies in prescribed medications. Communication between all healthcare professionals involved in Jayden’s treatment was unsatisfactory, with mistakes being made in updating key documents. Risk assessments were not updated accurately enough or in good time, and failed to capture important information, including historical and emerging information. Whilst there are lessons to be learnt following Jayden’s absconsion from the Linden Centre, the response from the emergency services and [railway] were appropriate, and any alternative actions would not have altered the eventual outcome within the time that was available to them.

with a medical cause of death of ‘1a Severe Multiple Injuries due to a train collision.","Jayden Andrew Booroff died of severe multiple injuries after being struck by a train on the tracks adjacent to Widford Road, Chelmsford. He had been admitted to The Linden Centre on 19 October 2020 after experiencing a psychotic episode whilst staying with friends in Bristol. At 19:56 on 23 October, Jayden was able to abscond from The Linden Centre after tailgating a member of staff. Jayden ran from the building and travelled by foot towards Chelmsford Town Centre. At 21:45, Jayden was struck by a train and killed. There were a number of contributing factors that led to Jayden’s absconsion, lack of capture and subsequent death:
1. Jayden had a history of illicit drug and alcohol use which contributed to his psychosis and led to intrusive thoughts, threats to self-harm and fear of being detained.
2. There was a family history of mental illness which was not considered strongly enough.
3. There were a number of structural and environmental vulnerabilities that impacted staff and patient security and safety.
4. Inconsistencies with level of patient care, record keeping and communication.","(1) Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust risk assessments missed key risk information that led to a reduction in observation levels on the ward.

(2) There is a lack of understanding at Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust level about the difference between:

a. a patient who has been granted section 17 leave under the Mental Health Act who does not return from a period of authorised leave, and

b. a patient who, being subject to detention under the Mental Health Act, has escaped from the confines of the ward and who has not been granted section 17 leave by the Responsible Clinician

II","Nicholas Dumphreys was 47 years old. He was a serving police officer with Cumbria Police. On 26 January 2020 he was on duty. He elected to respond to an emergency call. He drove a police issue BMW, at speed, down the M6. After PC Dumphreys passed junction 44, the engine of the vehicle failed catastrophically. This failure was very similar to other engine failures that have occurred in UK police vehicles with the same engine. As a result of the engine failure, the car veered across the carriageway, overturned, and crashed onto the verge. In the crash PC Dumphreys sustained fatal head injuries. His death was confirmed by the roadside at 14:24.","(1) In the course of the inquest I heard evidence about the role of the National Association of Police Fleet Managers ('NAPFM'). BMW UK made several presentations to NAPFM with a view to them publicising concerns about the N57 engine to their members. However, I heard evidence from the current chair of NAPFM and it is important to make two observations. First, NAPFM membership is not mandatory. There are police fleet managers who, for whatever reason, might not choose to join. Second, NAPFM has no official standing, status, or budget. It is largely reliant on the goodwill of its members to function. I am concerned that this informal approach may not be sufficiently robust. It may not ensure that safety critical information is passed to individual police forces.

(2) Evidence was given as to how 'end of life' police vehicles are disposed of. It was explained that quite frequently such vehicles are sold at auction. In relation to vehicles with N57 engines I heard that a particular effort was made to ensure that they were not auctioned but were destroyed. However, this appeared to me to be an ad hoc arrangement. I am concerned that there is no policy or guidance which ensures that equipment which is known to be faulty is not auctioned off and purchased by unsuspecting members of the public.

(3) The evidence that I heard indicated that there are no national standards for police garages and mechanics. I can understand that overly prescriptive guidelines might not be fit for purpose; the nature of different police areas may place very different demands on vehicles. A 'one size fits all' policy could be problematic.

Travers,Surrey,The Secretary of State for Transport; National Highways Limited; Connect Plus (M25) Limited,"I commenced an investigation into the death of Jordan Kevin Pry. The inquest concluded on the 22nd December 2022 when I found that the medical cause of death was:

Ia Multiple injuries

and my conclusion as to the death was that:

In the early hours of the 2nd April 2018, Jordan Pry was driving his BMW-M3 motor car along the anti-clockwise carriageway of the M25 motorway, between junctions 6 and 5, and in an easterly direction. It was raining heavily and the road surface was wet. Jordan Pry was driving in the third of four lanes, at a speed of approximately 78 miles per hour, when he drove through an area of surface water on the road and the car began to aquaplane and rotate. Whilst still rotating, the vehicle travelled across the second and first lanes and then left the carriageway to the nearside in the vicinity of marker post B4348, which is approximately 200 metres before the start of the slip-road to the Clacket Lane Services. The car then moved down or over the verge and steep embankment to the nearside of the road and collided with a tree. As a result of the collision and its force, the tree intruded into the vehicle from its offside central pillar and through the driver’s compartment, causing Jordan Pry to suffer fatal injuries. The collision occurred at 02.33 hours on the 2nd April 2018 and it is likely that Jordan Pry died shortly thereafter, although his death was formally pronounced, at the scene, at 02.52 hours, following the arrival of the emergency services.

The probable causes of the collision and Jordan Pry’s death were:

(i) The presence of excessive surface water on the road which resulted from –

(a) heavy rainfall,
(b) a blockage of a drain in the central reservation at a point approximately 65 metres southwest of the collision location which had been caused, unusually, by a large piece of plastic entering the drainage system and which resulted in there being a flow of water across the carriageway, and
(c) the profile of the road on the approach to the collision location which included a flat spot where the surface water was able to settle, and

(ii) The speed at which the BMW was being driven, namely a speed of approximately 78 miles per hour.

Prior to the collision there was a long history of wet-road related incidents at the location, including many aquaplaning events and a previous fatality. The absence of any warning on the approach to the collision location of the risk of aquaplaning, which was known to arise when there was excessive surface water on the road, and the absence of any vehicle restraint system at the nearside of the carriageway, were both possible contributory causes of the deceased’s death.

Jordan Pry died as a result of a road traffic collision.",,"As stated in my Conclusion (above), Jordan Pry died on the M25 motorway at marker post B4348, when he drove his vehicle through an area of surface water and the car began to aquaplane and rotate, causing it to leave the carriageway and collide with a tree. There is a long and significant history of aquaplaning incidents at the location, including a previous similar fatality following which, in 2010, a Prevention of Future Deaths Report was issued by the then Senior Coroner for Surrey. That report drew attention to the presence of surface water from rain and the effects of a blocked drain, and the presence of a flat spot on the road. Subsequently, changes were made to the drainage system at the location, first in 2011 by means of a small scale improvement scheme and secondly, as part of works completed in 2015, by means of the introduction of a slot drain. However, the flat spot still remains and aquaplaning incidents have continued.

I was told in evidence that there are ongoing investigations concerning the risk arising at the location, that a decision as to whether or not the flat spot should be addressed is still to be taken, and that a comprehensive plan for the management of the risk at the location cannot be made until that decision is taken.

The concern arising, therefore, is that there is an ongoing risk of further death at this location pending the implementation of an informed and comprehensive plan for risk management.",False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 December 2022. I arrived at a short form conclusion of road traffic collision. Ms Abukar’s medical cause of death was determined as: 1a head injury 1b blunt force trauma (road traffic collision),"Fatima Abukar was a 14 year old girl who died due to catastrophic head injuries sustained in a road traffic collision. Ms Abukar was observed to ride a battery-powered e-scooter in a southerly direction on the west pavement of Green Street, East Ham. Ms Abukar was travelling at a speed not less than 11 mph, she was not wearing any safety equipment. Ms Abukar left the pavement and entered the northbound carriageway of the road, against the flow of traffic. Ms Abukar bore left, over the central markings of the road and joined the southbound carriageway travelling alongside a mini-bus. The e-scooter struck the off-side of the mini-bus, Ms Abukar lost control and fell beneath the wheels of the mini-bus.","1. Evidence in this inquest confirmed that since 2019 there have been 8 recorded fatalities involving e-scooters in London and 31 in the country at large. At the time of her death Ms Abukar was riding a privately owned e-scooter on a public highway. Despite the ubiquity of such devices on London’s streets, riding them on public roads is unlawful. Whereas approximately 4000 unlawfully used scooters were seized by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2021, only 1100 were confiscated in 2022. The reduction is attributable to a change in policy introduced in November 2021. An inverse correlation exists between the rate of legal enforcement and the rate of deaths caused by e-scooters. The number of deaths in Q1 & 2 of 2022 is more than double that of Q1 & 2 of 2021.

2. Ms Abukar died due to traumatic head injuries. Riders of legally authorised scooters (those hired from licenced operators) are not required to wear head protection.

The conclusion of the inquest was: Road traffic collision,"At 14:30 on 16/06/2022, Mr Holbrook was knocked off his mobility scooter and was run over at the junction of Livingstone Road and the A435 Alcester Road. He had been travelling southbound along the footpath and left the pedestrian walkway at the mouth of the junction (where the kerb had been worn down) and entered the carriageway at the same time as Nissan Qashqai [REDACTED] tried to navigate and turn left onto the Alcester Road from Livingstone Road. He suffered catastrophic thoracic injuries, and despite life-saving treatment by emergency services, he could not be saved and was pronounced deceased at the scene at 14:57.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a  Rib fractures with flail segment

1b  Road traffic collision

1c

II  Ischaemic heart disease with cardiomegaly","1. I heard and considered evidence from West Midlands Police's Forensic Collision Unit which confirmed that where the footpath outside 214 Alcester Road South reaches the junction of Livingstone Road, it appears that there is a dropped kerb at the apex. On the opposite side of the junction, the kerbs are raised. West Midlands Police advise that this indicates that the dropped kerbs at this side of the junction are a result of vehicles mounting the kerb as they turn left from Livingstone Road to Alcester Road and therefore causing them to be eroded to be level with the road surface. There is also no tactile paving next to these kerbs, which indicate that this dropped kerb is not an ""official"" pedestrian crossing point - the same being situated approximately 9m from the end of Livingstone Road.
2. Mr Holbrook was able to leave the carriageway on his mobility scooter at apex/mouth of the junction due to the kerb being worn down to the road surface, and was struck in the carriageway.
3. On 12 September 2022, PC [REDACTED] of West Midlands Police submitted a notification via Birmingham City Council's Highway Department's online portal of the defect, with the Highways responding via email on 20 September 2022 stating that it did not meet the intervention levels that require repair.
4. I am concerned that vulnerable road users - particularly users of mobility scooters or bicycles - may inadvertently consider the worn down and defective kerb to be an ""official"" crossing point and enter the carriageway when it is unsafe to do so.
5. Furthermore, if a mobility scooter or similar were to enter the carriageway at the mouth of the junction (as Mr Holbrook did), they would then be unable to mount the kerb at the opposite side - they would have to travel west down the carriageway of Livingstone Road to the official crossing point, or alternatively (and more dangerously) navigate south on the carriageway into oncoming traffic onto Alcester Road.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,<NA>,Male,Other

Investigating police from the Serious Collisions Investigation Unit commented that they are aware that this location is a problem in heavy weather and have attended collisions at this location in the past.

The crash location is at the bottom of an incline on the M20 motorway which normally would not cause an issue, however the road also has a camber which causes water to run across the carriageway rather than draining into either the central reservation or the drain on the hard shoulder.

The police officer believes that it is when this heavy water is running across the carriageway that there is an issue which does require further investigation as to any remedial works that can be completed to prevent any further fatal/serious injury collisions.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,22,Female,Other

Smith,London Inner North,"Andrew Lord, Commissioner, Transport for London","On 11 February 2022, ME Hassell, HM Senior Coroner for Inner North London, commenced an investigation into the death of Miriam Boulia, aged 33 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 November 2022.","The collision occurred just before 9am on a Friday. It was a wet day. Ms Boulia was using a pedestrian crossing to cross Great Eastern Street at its junction with Curtain Road. After crossing safely to a pedestrian island, she initially waited there to cross Great Eastern Street, together with a small group of other pedestrians. Several other pedestrians crossed on a red man.

Ms Boulia then walked onto the crossing across Great Eastern Street, on a red man. She appeared to be holding her hood up whilst looking to her left. She was struck by a bus, which was travelling in a south-easterly direction, from her right, on green traffic signals. She fell underneath the bus and was dragged under it until it came to a standstill. As a result, she sustained catastrophic, unsurvivable injuries. She was declared deceased at the scene.

Although the driver of the bus took appropriate evasive action, the collision was unavoidable.","I received evidence, both in the form of a report and orally in court, from PC [REDACTED], a Traffic Management Officer in the Road Safety Engineering Unit of the Metropolitan Police. He is a qualified Highway Inspector recognised by the Institute of Highway Engineers and holds a RoSPA certificate in Road Safety, Collision Investigation and Prevention. As part of preparing his report, he conducted two site visits, when he observed the operation of the signals at the crossings at this junction and the behaviour of pedestrians.

The current timings of the signals, both at the pedestrian crossing where Ms Boulia died (at the North West side of Curtain Road, which I refer to as crossing 1) and the crossing over Great Eastern Street at the South East side of Curtain Road (by the Old Blue Last pub, which I refer to as crossing 2) do not allow enough time for pedestrians to cross the road safely.

The inter-green period (the period when the road traffic’s signals are not at green) at crossing 1 is only 10 seconds, made up of 6 seconds when the pedestrian signal is at green man and 4 seconds of “blackout” or “clearance” period. 10 seconds is insufficient time to allow pedestrians to cross the road safely before the road traffic’s signals change to green.

The green man for pedestrians is an invitation to cross, hence the blackout period should allow enough time for any pedestrians who step onto the crossing a moment before the green man goes out to cross the road safely. The current blackout period does not allow for this.

Although at crossing 1, the 10 second inter-green period extends to 16 seconds when there is no road traffic filtering from Curtain Road to Great Eastern Street, in practice this is rarely the case. There is no filtering traffic at crossing 2, but the inter-green period is still insufficient to allow pedestrians to cross safely.

PC [REDACTED] observed that pedestrians routinely cross on the red man at the crossings at the junction of Great Eastern Street and Curtain Road, probably due to the inadequate inter-green periods.

There have been 21 collisions involving injury at this junction over a recent three-year period, 9 of those involving injury to pedestrians. Of particular concern is that the number of collisions at this junction of a similar nature to that in which Ms Boulia died, is unusually high.

I also received a report from TfL, from which I note that this junction will now formally be included within TfL’s recently re-instituted Safer Junctions Programme (it previously was not part of the programme). However, the report indicated that the timescale for completion of any improvements to this junction is 2-4 years, subject to funding.

The TfL report indicated that any urgent safety improvements which need to be made at this junction in advance of progressing the wider scheme will be progressed, and that a site visit was being arranged for early 12 2022 to consider any urgent safety improvements.

PC [REDACTED] gave evidence that improvements to signal timings (including increasing the inter-green periods) can be made much quicker than installation of new signals (such as signals including countdown timers). I understand that such changes could be made much quicker than the 2-4 years envisaged for completion of the wider scheme.

I consider that changes to the signal timings would amount to urgent safety improvements.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,33,Female,Pedestrian

Road Traffic Collision:
The [Police] driver made a reasonable decision to follow a suspect vehicle, then carried out an inadequate risk assessment, in doing so he drove at an unsuitable speed and inappropriately decided not to use lights and sirens.
At 0.6 seconds prior to the collision, the driver applied the brakes at the speed of 61mph which was 16.1 metres from the pedestrian crossing. The police car then collided with two pedestrians on the pedestrian crossing; this led to the death of Andrew MacIntyre Brown on the 5 November 2019.
Considering the evidence, there were inadequacies in the policies and training in regards to the use of blue lights and sirens at night.","On 1 November 2019, the Police driver struck the deceased at a pedestrian crossing whilst driving at night over the speed limit and whilst not using blue lights and sirens, severely injuring the deceased. The Police driver was subsequently convicted of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving and was dismissed by the Police for gross misconduct. The inquest was heard before a jury and the jury was asked whether the Police policies in 2019 regarding the use by response-trained drivers of speed exemptions, activation of blue lights or sirens, and/or night-time emergency response driving was inadequate. The jury’s findings were that the Police policy was inadequate in that there was insufficient reference to other road users and pedestrians and their safety in the policy and the policy was also too open to interpretation, which both possibly contributed to the death.","1. There is insufficient reference to other road users and pedestrians and their safety in the Metropolitan Police Service Police Driver & Vehicle Policy - Vehicle and Equipment Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

Smith,Greater Lincolnshire,North Lincolnshire Council,On 25 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Adam David Simms (dob 07/09/02). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 October 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Simms died as a consequence of multiple injuries sustained in a road traffic collision which occurred on 21 May 2021. The formal conclusion was road traffic collision.,"On 21 May 2021 at around 09.00 a.m. Mr Simms was the driver and sole occupant of his Hyundai i30 motor car [REDACTED] which was travelling east out of Scunthorpe on the A18 road known locally as Mortal Ash Hill. The road comprised a section of dual carriageway which climbed a slight uphill gradient before transitioning into a single carriageway and commencing a slight downhill gradient. It had been raining heavily for some time. At the point at which the dual carriageway ended Mr Simms’ vehicle struck a large patch of water lying upon the carriageway. As a result of that hazard, he lost control of his vehicle and crossed onto the west bound carriageway where he collided with an oncoming lorry, sustaining fatal injuries. It was likely that Mr Simms was travelling too quickly for the weather conditions. Further, his vehicle was found to have insufficient tread to the offside front tyre. Those were contributory factors to his loss of control.","(1) I received evidence regarding the system of inspection utilised to identify and remedy any blocked drainage gullies. Two blocked gullies were found at the site of the accumulation of water upon the carriageway notwithstanding that an inspection undertaken only four days previously on 17 May 2021 had not identified those defects. They had not been included in cleansing works undertaken on 8 April 2022.

(2) The evidence suggested that at around the point at which Mr Simms lost control of his motor car there were two separate patches of standing water upon the carriageway. They were said to be 62m in length and 36m in length respectively. They occupied the majority of the width of the eastbound carriageway. Water was noted to a depth of between 10 and 15mm. There was plainly a significant quantity of standing water which posed a serious hazard to road users.

(3) Whilst the evidence I received did not establish on balance of probabilities that those blocked gullies were the cause of the patches of water described above, no alternative explanation for such a significant accumulation of water was provided by the evidence. It had plainly rained heavily, although there was no evidence to suggest an exceptional downpour had occurred.

(4) The absence of any explanation for this accumulation, and the consequential absence of any remedial action undertaken to prevent a repetition of these events gives rise to a concern that the highway at that location remains at risk of water ingress (from whatever source) unless and until the cause can be established and appropriate remedial action taken.",False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,19,Male,Driver

Henderson,Surrey,"Chief executive, Surrey County Council; Lead for Highways Agency, Surrey County Council","On 29 November 2021 I resumed the inquest touching on the death of Charles Michael Stringer which concluded on 30 November 2021.

The medical cause of death given was:

1a. Penetrating injury to the apex of right chest

I determined ‘Mr Charles Michael Stringer was a very fit man and a proficient cyclist. He developed a punctured tyre on his front wheel of his bike after hitting a pothole, which was awaiting repair, whilst cycling on Church Lane Headley. Following the puncture, he lost control of his bicycle and hit an iron railing at the side of the road. This resulted in a catastrophic chest injury incompatible with survival and he died at 12.44 hours on 22 June 2020 in Church Lane, Headley’.

My conclusion was that of an ACCIDENT","Statutory responsibility for road defect repairs lies with Surrey County Council (SCC) but they contract regular inspections and responses to public complaints and repairs to Keir Customer Services. Church Lane was inspected monthly and was last routinely inspected on 26 May 2020 when no defects were seen or recorded.

On 3 June 2020 a member of the public informed the Council there was a pothole which was the one responsible for Mr Stringer’s accident. An investigator attended the area on 4 June 2020 but failed to find the pothole, making an assumption that a repair on the road some 100m or so away from the pothole was responsible for the complaint.

On 6 June 2020 another member of the public reported the same pothole. An investigator attended on 9 June 2020, found the pothole and visually categorised it as a P3 pothole which allocated a maximum of 20 days for it to be repaired.

On 11 June 2020 a third concern was raised for the same pothole, but the member of the public was erroneously informed it had been repaired. On 17 June 2020 the same member of the public contacted the council again to say that contrary to what they were told, the pothole had not been repaired.

The same investigator attended and noted the pothole had deteriorated in the meantime. He re-categorised the pothole as a P2 with repair required within five days: no later than 23 June 2020, which was the day after Mr Stringer died after hitting the pothole.","1. A lack of reflection by SCC following Mr Stringer’s death

SCC indicated in their written submissions that a senior manager was available to give evidence as to reflection and learning following Mr Stringer’s death, in the absence of any such evidence in writing or a request to do so during the hearing.

2. A lack of action and/or change to the management of potholes by SCC following Mr Stringer’s death

SCC has indicated in written submissions that a number of discussions have taken place following Mr Stringer’s death but there has been no documented changes in systems or practice in particular:

1. What steps have been taken to ensure inspectors of defects are fully informed of recent complaints including those from members of the public regarding damage to bicycles by the state of the road.

2. What steps have been taken in the provision of a detailed and robust risk assessment by inspectors with all the available information available such as past complaints, the nature of the road and who uses the road to ensure a ‘holistic’ approach to decision making with regard to the necessity and the speed of road repairs.

3. What, if any, changes have been made to the pictorial guide and the matrix given to inspectors to ensure training there is not an ‘overly mechanistic’ assessment of a road defect.

4. What steps have been taken to ensure there is appropriate and timely communication between the SCC contact centre and the highways department such as a standard operating procedure in place when complaints must be forwarded on and responded to?

Salter,Oxfordshire,"Mr Stephen Chandler, Chief Executive, Oxfordshire County Council","On 2 August 2022 I concluded the inquest into the death of Jennifer Wong with a hearing at Oxford Coroners Court. Ms Wong was 32 years old when she died at the scene of a road traffic accident on 26 September 2021 on Headington Road, Oxford at the junction with Headley Way.

The conclusion was Road Traffic Collision with the following factual findings:

At approximately 09:55 hours on 26 September 2021 Jennifer Wong cycled along Headington Road towards traffic lights at the junction with Headley Way and cycled on the nearside of a stationary mobile crane. She was positioned on the nearside in a cycle lane intending to cycle straight on. The mobile crane was positioned in the nearside lane for vehicles turning left. On the lights changing Jennifer Wong and the mobile crane moved forwards and when the crane began to turn left into Headley Way it caused Jennifer Wong to be knocked to the ground and be run over, resulting in her instant death due to crush injuries.

I heard evidence from a number of witnesses at inquest along with other written statements and reports. I enclose the following documents for your information:

1. Police Report – 2/7/2022
2. Collision Investigators Report ([REDACTED]) - 19/4/2022
3. Report of [REDACTED] (Traffic Management Post Collision Report) – 22/10/2021
4. Statement of [REDACTED] of Oxfordshire County Council 1/8/2022
5. Record of Inquest

I heard oral evidence from the driver of the mobile crane and from [REDACTED]","Ms Wong was riding her pedal cycle on the morning of 26 September 2021 along Headington Road in Oxford and was intending to cycle straight across the junction. She was on the near side of a mobile crane intending to turn left into Headley Way. She was knocked off her pedal cycle by the crane and run over.

There were significant blind spots for the crane driver to the nearside. This is apparent from the report of [REDACTED] and the photographs therein. In addition to the issue of the blind spots, [REDACTED] also stated that an overarching issue is the cycle lane and the left turn at the traffic light junction which results in vulnerable road users coming into direct conflict with vehicles intending to turn left into Headley Way.","1. The first and main concern is in relation to the nearside cycle lane and what appeared to be an element of confusion or perhaps a dilemma for cyclists at this location intending to cycle straight across the junction. The cycle lane puts cyclists on the nearside of a lane that is specifically for vehicles turning right into Headley Way. There is the box/advanced stop line in front of the line of traffic in the lane but this requires the cyclist to decide to use it, and importantly, to have time to make it past the nearside of the vehicles and into the box before the vehicles in the lane commence their right turn.

If there was no cycle lane, it appears more likely that a cyclist heading straight across would position themselves in lane 2 for vehicles also heading straight on. I believe that further consideration should be given to this issue and if improved signage has a part to play to mitigate the risks.

I appreciate of course that it is not possible to remove risk completely and cyclists will make different choices about where to position themselves at a junction such as this one. I anticipate that the junction is not dissimilar to many others in Oxford. The issue of cyclists in nearside blind spots, particularly involving large commercial vehicles with limited visibility, therefore presents a significant and ongoing risk.

2. The second concern relates to the width of the cycle lane. It is believed to be 0.95 metres wide at this location but the recommended width is 1.2m or perhaps 1.5m. I understand this is an issue which has already been raised following a site meeting. There may be valid reasons why the lane is the width it is but I would be grateful if this could be considered.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,32,Female,Cyclist

Whitting,Bedfordshire and Luton,CEO Bedford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,"On 9 December 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Yuksel Bedri ISMAIL aged 23. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 August 2022. The narrative conclusion of the inquest was that:

After absconding from a nearby hospital, the deceased was struck by an HGV on the M1 and suffered fatal injuries.","Shortly before 19.30 hours on 28 November 2021, the Deceased was witnessed to run into the path of an oncoming HGV on the M1 motorway. Despite the driver of the HGV taking all possible avoiding action, the Deceased was struck by the front nearside of the HGV and was fatally injured; although, he was taken by paramedics to the Luton & Dunstable Hospital, his death was confirmed at 20.30 hours. He had been admitted to the Luton & Dunstable Hospital earlier that day after having been found in a vulnerable state and had been assessed by the Psychiatric Liaison Team as being psychotic, lacking in mental capacity, and in need of a MHA assessment. In view of his vulnerability, the Psychiatric Liaison Service staff had also requested the Accident and Emergency Staff to provide him with 1:1 observation as they were concerned about him leaving the hospital. Whilst still awaiting a full MHA assessment, shortly after 19.00 hours, he had been transferred by the same member of staff carrying out the 1:1 observation to a Ward but, during the transfer, had absconded and exited the hospital site heading towards the M1.","1. The Court was told that an SI investigation had not been completed by the Trust in this case; however, the PEARL Meeting on 3 December 2021 acknowledged that ""the current transfer policy needs reviewing...the transfer policy implemented around the mental health patients should be prioritised as there are risks involving patients and staff, all depending on the assessment of the patient"". Despite this and ELFT's own SI Report (disclosed to the Trust before the PIRH held on 26 May 2022) having highlighted the need for PLS staff to be involved in any decision regarding patients waiting for MHA assessment, or who may need to be conveyed to another area within the hospital site as 'such patients are high risk and often unpredictable', by the start of the Inquest held on 24 August 2022, there was no evidence of Bedford Hospitals NHS Trust's acceptance of the recommendations made. Whilst at lunchtime on the day of the Inquest itself, the Court was provided with a draft of a new Transfer Policy, this Policy still did not appear to have addressed the main issue:
- Whilst it includes ""Confused, disorientated, self-harming, suicidal or displaying erratic or aggressive behaviours"" and ""patients at risk of absconding"" in the list of 'At risk' patients in Section 3, the needs of such patients are still not addressed in the Assessment Tool (Appendix 4) nor is the need for consultation with the PLS staff about any of the escort/transfer arrangements.

2. Although ELFT's SI Report (disclosed to the Trust before the PIRH held on 26 May 2022) had highlighted that ""There is a need for staff involved in transferring patients, including security staff, to have training in the exercise of the Mental Capacity Act to ensure that patients who are assessed as lacking capacity with identified risks to self are unable to leave the emergency department"" and recommended that ""training be provided to acute Trust colleagues on the application of the Mental Capacity Act, its use to restrain/prevent somebody leaving the department if they are deemed to lack capacity and there are concerns regarding their risk should they leave, and where the person has capacity but remains a risk to the themselves"", there was no evidence before the Inquest of Bedford Hospitals NHS Trust's acknowledgment or consideration of this.
Instead:
- The Court heard from several Trust witnesses including an ED Sister, that they considered they had no powers to detain someone within the ED;
- The statement provided to the Inquest by the ED Lead, [REDACTED] (provided to the Court along with notice that he would NOT be available to attend the Inquest even though at the PIRH the Court had made it clear that the witness providing evidence of relevant Trust Policy would need to attend the Inquest) appeared confused about the powers available:
Para 12 ""Physical restraint is permitted in circumstances where the patient is confirmed to lack mental capacity and the restraint is necessary to preserve life or health and is proportionate to risk""
Para 17 ""Even if a single security officer had assisted with the transfer, they would be unable to physically restrain as the restraint policy specifies a minimum of two security officers are required for this and Mr Ismail was not subject to lawful DOLS at that point"";

Farrow,Greater Manchester South,"Chief Constable, Greater Manchester Police; [Redacted], Roads and Crime Unit & Response, Cheshire Constabulary","On 28 May 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Brandon James Pryde, otherwise known as Brandon Geasley. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 July 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that he died from multiple injuries in a road traffic collision.

On 28 May 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of David Ernest Faulkner. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 July 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that he died from multiple injuries in a road traffic collision in which his car was struck by a car which was being driven at speed on the wrong carriageway of a motorway.","The deaths of Brandon Pryde and Ernest Faulkner arose out of the same road traffic collision on 27 May 2021 on the M60 motorway between junctions 1 and 27 at Stockport.

A BMW X4 SUV that had been stolen earlier that day in Stockport was seen by a police officer at about 8.30pm in the Wythenshawe area and officers of the Greater Manchester Police Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit (“TVIU”) went to that area later that evening to try to locate and recover the vehicle. At about 9.50pm, the BMW was seen by a TVIU patrol, now bearing false number plates. Brandon Pryde was the driver of the BMW at that time.

The BMW drove away from the TVIU car at speed and a spontaneous pursuit began. The TVIU officer was trained in both initial and tactical pursuit and self-authorised the pursuit, which began on A roads towards the motorway network at speeds around 70 mph. The pursuit was monitored by the GMP control room operators, who alerted the Force Duty Supervisor to the pursuit. That officer began to monitor the pursuit, which moved onto the M56 motorway just over a minute after it commenced.

Once on the motorway, the speed of the BMW increased to over 100 mph, reaching speeds of 130 mph. The TVIU car travelled at similar speeds in pursuit. The weather conditions were described as clear and dry and the motorway traffic was light, but the dashcam and CCTV footage showed that there were a number of other vehicles, including the Vauxhall Insignia driven by David Faulkner, travelling in the same direction as the pursuit, with the BMW and TVIU car predominantly in the outside lane as they travelled onto and along the M60 towards Stockport.

The GMP Force Duty Supervisor did not take any active role in the supervision of the pursuit, assuming that as the pursuit had joined the motorway network, that the equivalent officer of the North West Motorway Patrol Group (“NWMPG”) had taken over the supervision of the pursuit. Although the NWMPG control room was aware of and monitoring the pursuit during the time that it was on the motorway network, the Supervisor was undertaking their assessment of the situation and did not take control of the pursuit.

David Faulkner’s car was overtaken by the pursuit. Although other police patrols followed, none was in a position to be part of the active pursuit.

A trained GMP Tactical Advisor did give advice to deploy a stinger device and containment and if the BMW were to attempt to travel in the wrong direction (“go contra”), to consider tactical contact if safe to do so.

The BMW left the motorway at junction 27 and was lost from the sight of the following TVIU car. The pursuit had been in progress for approximately 4 minutes by this time. 20 seconds later, as a GMP dog van patrol arrived at the end of the slip road at junction 27, the BMW was driven past the police van, back up the slip road to re-join the M60, but now travelling in the opposite direction, against the flow of traffic. It drove in the outside lane at speed past a second TVIU car (which was travelling in the correct direction), before moving to the inside lane and into collision with the Vauxhall Insignia driven by Mr. Faulkner in the middle lane about 550 metres from the point at which the BMW had re-joined the M60 carriageway.

The three police vehicles had begun to follow in the same direction, but on the parallel, correct carriageway of the motorway.

The topography and relative speeds of the vehicles meant that neither Mr. Faulkner nor Mr. Pryde had any opportunity to avoid the collision which had an estimated closing speed of at least 150 mph and which resulted in an extremely forceful impact, causing destructive damage to both vehicles and fatal injuries to both drivers, who died at the scene.","I received evidence in both inquests that there is a protocol between GMP and NWMPG (which is based at the Cheshire Constabulary) dated 6/2015 in accordance with the College of Police Authorised Professional Practice for Police Pursuits, for the command and control of pursuits. That protocol is intended to provide a mechanism for command and control to be undertaken and transferred between GMP and NWMPG when pursuits move between the normal road network and the motorway network, so that command and control is maintained throughout. The supervising officer in the control room has the authority to direct that a pursuit be discontinued if they assess that it is right to do so, having regard to all of the circumstances which are known to them, which may include information not immediately available to the police officer(s) involved in the pursuit.

Although I found that the absence of any control-room command and control had not contributed to either death in this case, the following matters gave rise to concern, having regard to the inherent risk of pursuits, which are likely to move between ordinary road and motorway networks in the Greater Manchester area;

(1) The GMP Force Duty Supervisor assumed that the NWMPG Supervisor had taken command and control when they had not done so;
(2) The NWMPG Supervisor did not communicate whether they had taken command and control clearly;
(3) The GMP Force Duty Supervisor did not consider that they had any authority to perform command and control of the pursuit once it had entered the motorway network; and
(4) The protocol did not operate in practice so that there was no effective command and control at any point during the pursuit.",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

The driver of the other car (Amy Purvis) died later in hospital. He did not have a valid driving licence and there was no evidence that he had ever held a driving licence. He had epilepsy and should not have been driving and indeed had told his GP that he was not driving. Toxicology showed that he was not taking his anti-epileptic medication regularly. Post mortem showed that he died from abdominal (liver laceration) and pelvic injuries. He was not wearing a seat belt. His blood alcohol level was 203 mg/100mls.","Mr Wheatley was involved in a road traffic collision on 14 December 2021 on the A66, Rokeby Grange, Barnard Castle.","The other driver killed in the road traffic collision was a 36 year old woman (Amy Weston Purvis) who was driving home to her family.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 July 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:-

Ethan Wright, a 16-year-old boy, died from the serious head injuries he suffered when the bicycle he was riding collided with a van, on 17 November 2021 in Lowestoft, Suffolk.

Despite undergoing emergency surgery, Ethan’s injuries were not survivable, and he passed away the following day on 18 November 2021

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1a Severe traumatic brain injury
1b Road traffic collision","Ethan Wright died at the Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge in Cambridgeshire on 18 November 2021.

Ethan had been admitted to the Addenbrookes Hospital on 17 November 2021 following a collision between the bicycle he was riding and a van. The collision occurred in Higher Drive, Lowestoft in Suffolk at approximately 10:10am on 17 November 2021.

Ethan rode from a public bridleway (Woods Loke West) onto Higher Drive, where his bicycle hit the front nearside of the van, his head then hitting the nearside A-pillar between the windscreen and passenger door.

Ethan sustained serious injuries to his head and was subsequently airlifted to Addenbrookes Hospital, where despite surgical intervention he tragically succumbed to his injuries the following day.","In evidence it was heard that the public bridleway, Woods Loke West, is predominantly used by pedestrians and cyclists.

As part of the police investigation, photographs were provided that showed the area where Woods Loke West joins Higher Drive.

Woods Loke West joins Higher Drive at approximately a 90-degree angle and vehicle access to the Loke is prevented by two concrete bollards. These bollards are placed wide enough apart as to not cause a hindrance to either cyclists or pedestrians.

When cycling from Woods Loke West onto Higher Drive, the view afforded of Higher Drive is severely restricted by fencing, and it is only once a cyclist or pedestrian is on the pavement of Higher Drive itself, are they afforded any view of the main road to their right. This is the direction of travel of the van with which Ethan collided.

The police officer who investigated Ethan’s tragic death, stated in evidence that there was no physical barrier, or any other measure in place, that would make a cyclist or fast-moving pedestrian slow down before entering Higher Drive. The police officer was particularly concerned about children using the Loke as a cycle path, as these young riders have a much lower perception of risk.

The officer was of the opinion that some physical means of preventing direct access onto Higher Drive from Woods Loke West, or some other measure to ensure a cyclist or fast-moving pedestrian slowed down on approaching Higher Drive, would prevent a further tragedy at this location.",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,16,Male,Cyclist

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 July 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:-

Stephen ‘John’ Coombes died on 3 September 2021, at the Addenbrookes Hospital, in Cambridge.

John had been admitted to the Addenbrookes Hospital on 29 August 2021 following a single vehicle road traffic collision on the A1101, Burnt Fen, near Mildenhall in Suffolk.

Immediately after the road traffic collision, John was trapped upside down in his vehicle, and initially could not be extracted from it. Due to the position he was in, John’s airway was closed, inducing postural asphyxia.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1a Complications arising from traumatic and hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury
1b Head injury in association with postural asphyxia.","Stephen ‘John’ Coombes died on 3 September 2021, at the Addenbrookes Hospital, in Cambridge.

John had been admitted to the Addenbrookes Hospital on 29 August 2021 following a single vehicle road traffic collision on the A1101, Burnt Fen, near Mildenhall in Suffolk.

The convertible Porsche John was driving left the road and came to rest upside down in a ditch. John was originally trapped in the upside-down car pinned to the ground.

Attending police officers and ambulance crew were able to release John and extricate him from the vehicle.

John was taken to Addenbrookes, but due to the injuries he had received, he continued to deteriorate until he passed away on 3 September 2021.

Subsequent police investigation identified that a deep depression in the road surface contributed to John losing control of the vehicle he was driving.

This depression was known to be present by the Highways authority, and a temporary 30 mph speed limit (instead of the usual 50 mph) had been put in place.

Inadequate road signage did not reflect the temporary 30 mph limit and John hit the depression at approximately 50 mph, his vehicle being forced off the road as a result.

Had John known to negotiate the depression at 30 mph, this tragic incident would not have occurred.","The court heard that the depression was known to be present by the Highways Authority, and a temporary 30 mph speed limit (instead of the usual 50 mph) had been put in place.

Evidence was heard from the Forensic Crash Investigation Officer from Suffolk Constabulary, who conducted an investigation into the road traffic collision which caused John’s death.

This officer told the court how he and a colleague drove a police vehicle over the depression in the road at various speeds to observe the reaction the vehicle had to the damaged road surface.

At 30 mph the police vehicle negotiated the depression in the road with relative ease.

At 50 mph, the police vehicle reacted significantly when negotiating the depression.

At the time of John's collision, he had just overtaken another vehicle and therefore crossed the depression at a slight angle as he returned to his own side of the carriageway.

When the police officers replicated this vehicle movement at 50 mph, the police vehicle reacted violently, with one of the rear wheels leaving the surface of the road. The officer driving that vehicle was not prepared to attempt the same manoeuvre at any higher speed due to the risk involved.

The police officer then told the court that the attending officers themselves were unaware of the 30 mph speed limit on this stretch of road. The officer told the court that the main 50 mph signs, the smaller repeater 50 mph signs and the 50 mph roundels painted on the road surface were all clearly visible on this stretch of road.

Prior to the depression the officer saw one temporary 30 mph partially obscured in the verge, but assumed it was left over from previous works, as all of the 50 mph signs remained in view.

Evidence was heard that in the normal course of events, when a temporary reduction in a speed limit is imposed on a stretch of road, any signage indicating a higher speed limit should be covered by either securing a dark bag or sack over the sign, or spray painting it out.

On the basis of the police officers’ evidence, that clearly did not occur in this case, and this, coupled to there being only one 30 mph temporary sign in place prior to the depression in the road, left road users (and attending police officers) unaware of the reduced speed limit in place.

I am therefore concerned that should further identified road defects require a reduction in the speed limit, that any repeat of the provision of inadequate signage and/or a failure to obscure higher speed limits may result in further fatalities.",False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

Mr Shuttleworth’s medically certified cause of death was 1a) Head and chest injuries complicated by Covid-19 associated bronchopneumonia; 1b) Road traffic collision (pedestrian); 2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and frailty of old age.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Shuttleworth’s death was due to a road traffic collision.","Mr Shuttleworth sustained his ultimately fatal head and chest injuries at about 16:55 on 5 November 2020 when, as he was crossing Bridge Street in Huddersfield, he was struck and knocked over by a Mercedes Vario Box Van, registration number [REDACTED] with the number [REDACTED] painted on its bonnet, which was turning right into Bridge Street from Lockwood Road.

The van was owned by UPS and was being driven by UPS’s employee [REDACTED] in the course of his employment with UPS as a delivery driver.

Two matters of fact were found to have caused the collision: first, Mr Shuttleworth stepped into the road at a pedestrian crossing which was showing a red light against him; second, [REDACTED] did not see Mr Shuttleworth before striking him and knocking him over.","(1) [REDACTED] who was suspended by UPS the day after the collision and dismissed by them shortly thereafter, gave evidence that his view from the van when making right turns such as this one was obscured by a large blind spot.

(2) An independent Forensic Collision Investigator (“FCI”) gave evidence that, when sitting in the driver’s seat at the position [REDACTED] had adjusted it to, there was a large blind spot to the driver’s offside, which may have masked the presence of Mr Shuttleworth at certain points of the right turn manoeuvre.

(3) The FCI gave evidence that this blind spot area was due to the driver’s offside “A” post and rear-view door mirror assembly and was further affected by the driver’s sliding door frame which when closed increased the blind spot area. (The FCI said anecdotally, and not as part of his evidence, that he understood that this particular configuration of the Mercedes Vario Box Van was unique to vans supplied by Mercedes to UPS.)

The Sussex Police Forensic Reconstruction Report FC1/012/21 concluded that it was highly likely that the collision was as a result of the defect to the road, and the pothole specifically.","Under the East Sussex Highway Asset Inspection Manual, this pothole fell within the definition of Cat 3 - LOW for risk and remedial works. The definition is “Greater than 40mm and less than 59mm deep and at least 300mm in all directions”.

a) The curve of the road and foliage restricted the view to a maximum of 78 metres in the relevant direction.

b) There were no advance warning signs for motorists approaching from the Leominster direction of the footpath which crosses the A44 at this location.

c) Calculations show the oncoming vehicle was travelling at or below the speed limit for the area.

d) The pedestrians likely left the safety of the pavement at around the same time the oncoming vehicle would have come into view.

e) In only a few seconds both motorist and pedestrians would be required to react and consider what action to take.","(1) The point where the footpath crosses the A44 provides limited visibility to both pedestrians and motorists

Ridley,Wiltshire and Swindon,"Acting Director Highways and Transport, Wiltshire Council","On the 7 June 2021 I accepted the transfer of an investigation into the death of Albert Thomas Stafford Manley who was known to his family as “Jim”. I went on to open Jim’s inquest on the 14 June 2021 and concluded both his and his late wife’s inquest on the basis that their deaths arose out of the same incident on the 19 May 2022. I found that Jim’s medical cause of death was as follows:-

1a) Multiple traumatic injuries.

As regards how, when and where Jim came by his death I recorded as follows:-

Albert, known to his family as “Jim”, died at Southampton General Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton, Hampshire on Monday 31 May 2021 from multiple traumatic injuries. Jim’s injuries were sustained when his Ford Mondeo collided on the opposite/northbound side of the highway with the front offside of an oncoming Land Rover Discovery on the morning of Sunday 30 May 2021 whilst both vehicles were travelling in opposite directions on the B3081 near Tollard Royal in Wiltshire at a bend and junction with a minor road leading to Tollard Green (OS Ref ST917 183). It is unclear as to why Jim’s car crossed the centre of the highway and collided with the front of Land Rover Discovery as to whether he intended to exit the junction and head towards Tollard Green or misinterpreted the layout of the road at the junction.

As a conclusion I recorded road traffic collision.",,"Although I was unable to make a finding of fact in this case Jim more likely than not misunderstood the road layout, I was satisfied that it was a possibility and I am concerned that a driver who is unfamiliar with that road section could read the road incorrectly taking into account what they physically see and having regard to the road signs approaching the junction, leading to such a misunderstanding. The national speed limit on this section of road is, of course, 60 mph and every driver has a duty to drive at a speed commensurate with road conditions and additionally owes a duty of care to other road users in terms of driving carefully and considerately. How is it possible to misread the road? In answering that question, see figure 1 below, is a photograph of the view using Google Earth cameras approaching the junction heading in the same south easterly direction that Jim would have been travelling.

At approximately 200 metres from the junction is a very clear sign (above) highlighting the junction with the main B3081 continuing left to Tollard Royal and the road leading off to Tollard Green. In the photograph in the road ahead depending on the type of vehicle being driven and its position you can see a left-hand bend ahead of you. The visible bend is in fact a left hand bend once you have left the B3081 and is part of the road heading towards Tollard Green. It is not the junction bend on careful analysis.

The next photograph at figure 2 shows a sign for tourist and information purposes which lies approximately 85 metres from the junction with Tollard Green. You can however see the bend ahead which again is the bend beyond the junction and is not the Tollard Green, Tollard Royal junction which is still hidden.

In figure 3 below a chevron sign at the time of the collision was missing on the sign post to the right of the highway but this sign together with the road markings have now been replaced/refreshed. As a driver myself the chevron markings would be of more assistance to a driver at night time although, of course, they would be visible in the day time but due to size to a lesser degree. At night, the reflective paint differentiating between black and white in my personal view would make the sign more obvious especially when headlights would be unlikely to pick up the Tollard Green bend ahead.

In considering my duty to make a report to prevent future deaths I had a report prepared by [REDACTED] from Wiltshire Police (copy attached) and in that report he documented a previous collision history in the last 5 years and in particular 2 incidents, 1 occurring in 2017 and the other in 2018, both of which involved vehicles turning right at the junction to Tollard Green. One incident involved a car and a motorcycle, the other involving a car and a van. I also heard evidence from [REDACTED] who has lived in the area for a number of years that the route via Tollard Green into Verwood and Bournemouth is used by many as a back road in respect of which he described it as “a rat run” and cars apparently do not necessarily slow to any great degree when exiting that junction from a south easterly direction.

In his report makes 2 recommendations, one of which is to remove the hedgerow to the left to increase visibility around the bend. That recommendation, I have to say, is of some concern to me as I do not think that it would tempt drivers to slow down to any degree and they would be more likely in looking across to look for oncoming traffic and may not always pick up smaller vehicles such as cyclists and motorcycle users when looking to exit the junction heading towards Tollard Green. That recommendation is also of concern to me because Wiltshire at the end of the day is a rural county and its hedgerows and the wildlife contained within the hedgerows are an important feature of its character. I also heard evidence from one of our Coroners Officers, [REDACTED], who commented that the hedgerows have an additional purpose in trying to prevent deer which are a feature in this particular area leaving the fields and crossing the roads. He acquired this information when he was a serving Police Officer and from speaking to one of the nearby landowners. Deer crossing road especially at night can pose a dangerous and unexpected hazard.

As regards the second recommendation from [REDACTED] this may be something that you might be willing to consider or whether there perhaps is a better way through the use of further signing to make it even clearer as regards the existence of the junction and the bend. In asking you to consider painting the word “SLOW” as you approach the bend in both directions as recommended by [REDACTED] I am mindful of the fact that as the highway authority you are under no obligation to provide such warnings as was pointed out by the House of Lords in the 2003 decision in “Gorringe”.

I am however concerned that there is a possibility that the road could be misread and that the bend having exited the junction heading towards Tollard Green could be mistaken by motorists unfamiliar with this section of the road, be confused with the bend and the junction on the B3081 heading towards Tollard Royal. The bend having exited the junction heading towards Tollard Green is very similar in shape to the bend heading towards Tollard Royal which is hidden until you get very close to it.

I can see the propensity for a mistake being made here even if it is a mistake that I myself, I hope, would not make and I would ask you to consider if there is anything further that could be done to warn of this junction and bend to further minimise the possibility of any misunderstanding being made by road users if you are minded not to adopt [REDACTED] recommendation.",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 February 2022.

The conclusion of the investigation in relation to both deceased was Road Traffic Collision.","Michael John Draper and Rafal Wojdyl died in a road traffic collision which occurred on 23 June 2021 on Cadishead Way, Irlam at its junction of Fairhills Road, Irlam. Mr Draper was driving a Dacia Logan vehicle and Mr Wojdyl was sat in the rear seat of the vehicle directly behind Mr Draper. The vehicle was being driven along Fairhills Road towards the junction with Cadishead Way, Irlam.

At the same time, a Heavy Goods Vehicle was being driven northbound along Cadishead Way towards Manchester and a Citroen Berlingo was travelling in the opposite direction along Cadishead Way intending to turn right into Fairhills Road, Irlam.

At the junction Mr Draper, without reason, pulled out of Fairhills Road into Cadishead Way directly into the path of the Heavy Goods Vehicle and there was a collision and as the collision developed Mr Draper's vehicle was pushed back by the Heavy Goods Vehicle causing a further collision between Mr Draper's vehicle and the Citroen Berlingo.

Both deceased sustained injuries in the collision and they were taken to the Salford Royal Hospital, where they later died from their injuries.

The junction of Cadishead Way with Fairhills Road, Irlam is not controlled by traffic signals and the speed limit on Cadishead Way, Irlam in the area of the junction is 50mph.","1) During the inquest evidence was heard that:

a) The junction is very busy allowing access to industrial and retail units, including Tesco, Lidl and Screwfix off Fairhills Road, Irlam.

b) Cadishead Way, Irlam is a very busy designated 'A' road, namely the A57 road, which is an access road towards Manchester in one direction and the M6 motorway in the other direction.

c) At the junction there is no footpath on one side of Cadishead Way and approaching the junction with Fairhills Road from the direction of the M6 motorway there is a bend, a bridge, trees and bushes, all of which obscure and affect the line of vision of vehicles exiting Fairhills Road into Cadishead Way, Irlam.

d) The junction of Fairhills Road with Cadishead Way, Irlam is very busy with vehicles turning into both Fairhills Road and Cadishead Way from both directions, which could cause distractions to head drivers, particularly a driver exiting Fairhills Road into Cadishead Way with vehicles travelling at 50mph along Cadishead Way and the restricted view.

Hunt,Birmingham and Solihull,The Priory Group; The Department of Health,"On 9 October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Alexander Caseby. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was;

Matthew Caseby became acutely unwell with a psychotic illness on 3 September 2020. Following his admission and subsequent absconsion from the Priory Hospital in Edgbaston, Matthew stepped in front of a train on 8 September 2020 and was fatally injured. At the time, Matthew was suffering from disordered thinking and did not have the capacity to form any intention to end his life. Matthew absconded from Beech ward on 7 September 2020. He absconded over a fence in the courtyard area and at the time of his absconsion Matthew was unattended. It was inappropriate for Matthew to be left unattended in the courtyard.
There were concerns regarding Matthew absconding but the recording processes on Beech ward were inadequate which resulted in the communication to staff involved in Matthew’s care being lacking.
As a result of risks not being fully recorded, Matthew’s risk assessment was not adequate as it was not based on all of the available information. There were shortcomings in the Priory processes for recording and sharing information between staff.
Matthew was not on any specific observations in the courtyard to avoid his risk of absconsion. There was no written policy on observation levels in the courtyard, the omission of which led to a lack of consistent understanding by staff as to what should happen in the area. This made the courtyard area unsuitable for use by patients.
The Priory staff did have concerns regarding the height of the fence in the courtyard at a ward level but there is no evidence that there was a formal raising or escalation of this issue to a senior level which was a missed opportunity. However senior hospital management were aware of previous absconsions over the courtyard fence. When reviewing these incidents there was insufficient attention paid to the physical security of the area, with the focus being on the reasons why the patient absconded rather than how they absconded. This was a missed opportunity.
Overall, the inadequate risk assessment for Matthew, the inadequate documentation records, the lack of a risk assessment for the courtyard area and the absence of a policy regarding observation levels in the courtyard means that the courtyard was not safe for Matthew to use unattended.
His death was contributed to by neglect on the part of the treating hospital.","Following calls to the Police from members of the public reporting sightings of a male on the railway lines and in a school playground, Matthew Caseby was found by Oxfordshire Police in a playground in Islip in Oxfordshire on 03/09/20. Following a conversation with Matthew, the Police officers took the decision to detain him under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act.

Matthew was taken to a place of safety at Vaughan ward part of Warneford Hospital, where he was assessed and detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act as he was found to be suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which required detention for his or other’s safety.

Due to his registered GP being in Birmingham, because of him previously being a student at Birmingham University, a bed was found for Matthew at the Priory Hospital in Edgbaston, Birmingham.

Matthew arrived at the Priory Hospital at 05:05 on 05/09/20. At 06:00 on 05/09/20 Matthew was assessed by the resident medical officer (RMO). The RMO completed a risk assessment in the presence of a registered nurse and a healthcare assistant. The RMO recorded that Matthew had a low suicide and self harm risk and recorded an overall medium risk on the risk assessment. The RMO determined that level 2 observations be put in place meaning that he would receive 4 checks per hour.

Notes recorded by staff on 05/09/20 show that Matthew presented as guarded and delusional and that he wanted to leave the ward. Matthew was also seen to be responding to unseen stimuli.

Evidence presented show that on 06/09/20 Matthew was presenting as guarded, anxious and responding to unseen stimuli. It was also recorded on the handover notes that Matthew was at risk of absconsion. It was noted that Matthew was loitering by ward exits and that he made an attempt to leave with a black bin bag.

Although it was not recorded in any of the written notes a HCA gave evidence that on 06/09/20 Matthew was observed looking at the fence in the courtyard and that she was concerned that he would try to abscond. To mitigate this the HCA gave evidence that she stood at the highest point of the steps. The HCA advised that she made a colleague aware verbally but did not record this risk in any of the written notes.

The handwritten handover notes do mention that Matthew was at risk of absconsion but the notes were incomplete. The information regarding Matthew’s risk of absconsion was not captured on the electronic notes which were the ones relied upon by the doctors when completing the ward round/MDT.

The ward round/MDT took place and Matthew was seen by 2 doctors and 1 registered nurse at 13:30 on 07/09/20. One of the doctors reviewed the electronic notes. The handwritten notes were not present during the MDT and the contributing nurse gave evidence that she did not read these in advance as it had been a very busy shift and she did not have time. The risk assessment (initially completed by the RMO on 05/09/20) was not reviewed during the MDT. Matthew reported low mood during the MDT. The senior doctor prescribed anti-psychotic medication, but Matthew refused to take this.

Following the MDT the nurse raised concerns to the doctors that Matthew was physically fit and would be able to scale the fence in the courtyard should he try to. Upon hearing the concerns no additional risk assessment was undertaken and no additional measures were put in place. Both of the doctors gave evidence that they assumed Matthew would be supervised at all times in one courtyard as was standard practice (although there was no official policy).

On 07/09/20 at 16:40 Matthew asked a HCA if he could go into the courtyard and was escorted out by the HCA who remained with him initially. After 15 minutes the HCA asked Matthew to return inside but he refused. The HCA left Matthew in the courtyard under the supervision of 2 other HCAs who were supervising two other patients who were on 1:1 checks. Matthew was observed throwing something over the courtyard perimeter fence. At 17:02 one of the HCAs returned inside to flag that her and her colleague would be returning inside with their 1:1 patients meaning that Matthew would be left unattended in the courtyard. This was flagged to the nurse in charge and the original HCA.

Matthew was inappropriately unattended in the courtyard. This was in contrast to what the majority of staff reported to be standard practice during their evidence. There was no official written policy or guidance on supervision or observation in the courtyard and there was no risk assessment in place.

Matthew was unattended for 1 minute and 40 seconds initially. During this time the HCA who had originally given him access to the courtyard could be observed on CCTV images in the nurse’s office and using the staff toilet. The HCA then approached the courtyard and viewed Matthew through the vestibule window. Before the HCA could rejoin Matthew in the courtyard, she was called by a colleague to assist with an emergency ligature situation. This meant that Matthew was unattended for a further 5 minutes. No staff member was informed he was unattended.

CCTV showed Matthew moving towards the courtyard fence at 17:06 and he then disappeared from the view of the camera. At 17:07 a HCA on her break in the smoking area observed Matthew walking past her. She approached Matthew and asked if he was OK but he did not respond. The HCA made her way to Beech ward to inform staff of what she had seen.

Another HCA was on her break and stood at the bottom of the hospital driveway. She saw and recognised Matthew and asked him where he was going. Matthew responded that he was “going home” and picked up speed as he left hospital grounds. The HCA called Beech ward to report what she had seen.

The nurse in charge of the ward immediately called 999 upon realisation that Matthew had absconded. No other action was taken by the staff at the Priory.

Although staff did have concerns regarding the height of the fence in the courtyard, there is no evidence that it had been raised in any written or official way or followed up, through established forums to make senior hospital management aware.

Although the height of the fence did meet national guidelines the courtyard was not suitable for patients to use due to the lack of a risk assessment and the absence of any written policy specifying observations and supervision whilst the patients were using it.

At 17:56 on 07/09/20 Police arrived at the Priory Hospital having already searched the local area in an attempt to find Matthew. On arrival at the ward, the officers spoke to the staff present in the nurse’s office. The Police attempted to get additional information that could assist them with finding Matthew such as next of kin, previous addresses or known contacts. The Priory staff advised Police that Matthew was very guarded and that they didn’t have this information. Police were provided with Matthew’s section paperwork from the hospital in Oxfordshire.

When reviewing this paperwork once they’d left the Priory, the Police saw that Matthew had been found on railway lines, which was information that they had not previously been aware of. At 18:46 the Police made British Transport Police (BTP) aware of Matthew as a missing person.

There was some confusion around where Matthew was originally picked up by the Police in Islip. Inconsistencies in paperwork showed that Matthew was found on railway lines, but it was a children’s playground where he was picked up.

At 19:20 West Midlands Police (WMP) opened a missing person record for Matthew and recorded that he was a medium risk.

At 19:32 [REDACTED], Matthew’s Father, contacted Police to raise concerns that Matthew may try to harm himself. Matthew’s risk level remained at medium. The Police gave evidence that they were in contact with Matthew’s Mother and Sister over the course of the evening. Based on information received from them a previous address and place of employment were attended. They also searched the Selly Oak triangle area of Birmingham which Matthew was familiar with, in an attempt to find him but unfortunately Matthew could not be located.

At 01:27 on 08/09/20 Matthew’s case was assessed again by the Police response manager and found to be medium risk. No further search took place and the case was handed to the locate team.

The locate team picked up Matthew’s case at 07:00 on 08/09/20. At this point the risk level was raised to high. Officers were allocated to try to find Matthew and a fast track action list was set out. Officers were limited with what checks they could complete due to the fact that Matthew didn’t have a debit card or mobile phone and had no contacts in the area.

Evidence from British Transport Police confirmed that a collision occurred between a train and a male at 08:40 on 08/09/20. The train had departed University Station and was travelling in the direction towards Five Ways Station. The train was accelerating and was within the permitted speed limits. As the train was adjacent to Vale Campus location the driver saw Matthew appear from undergrowth. Matthew ran out and placed himself in front of the train. As soon as the driver saw Matthew, he applied the emergency brake and sounded the horn. Unfortunately, the driver was unable to stop in time and the collision took place.

It was confirmed that the collision was fatal at 09:11 by the Paramedic at the scene who confirmed life extinct. It was established that Matthew was the individual who had been hit by reviewing CCTV images of Matthew. Formal identification took place using fingerprints.

Between Matthew absconding from the Priory over the courtyard fence at 17:06 on 07/09/20 and the collision that took place at 08:40 on 08/09/20 there is no evidence showing Matthew’s whereabouts or activities.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a Head Injury

1b High Impact Collision with a Train

II Psychotic episode","For the Priory Hospital

1. Record keeping: During the inquest staff confirmed that they record information about patients in two ways. On the electronic records and on handwritten handover sheets. During the inquest the evidence confirmed that different information was recorded on each. During the inquest the evidence confirmed that different information was recorded on each. I have serious concerns that staff are recording information in two places and this creates a real risk, as materialised in Matthew’s case, that different information is recorded in each place and key information gets lost.

2. Record keeping quality: There were numerous inaccuracies in Matthew’s medical records, e.g. his status was written as informal when he was formal, he was described as violent when he was not and was described as ""she"". Staff were unable to explain how that occurred. The investigation witness from the Priory thought there was an element of cutting and pasting into the records from another patient’s records. I have serious concerns about the accuracy of the clinical record at the Priory for what are some of the most vulnerable patients.

3. Risk assessments: The inquest heard how all members of staff can update a risk assessment at any time. Despite this, and with clear evidence that Matthew was at risk of absconsion, his risk assessment was not updated over the weekend when the risk materialised. I have serious concerns about how risk assessments are completed, when they are completed, who completes them and whether they are updated in a timely and necessary manner by suitably experienced staff.

4. Serious incidents: The inquest heard evidence that a previous absconsion over the courtyard fence in October 2019 had not prompted any review of the height of the fence and focused on why the patient absconded i.e. to have a cigarette. I have serious concerns that the system of investigation in place at the Priory means critical lessons are not learnt at the appropriate time.

5. Courtyard fence: A patient absconded over the courtyard fence during the inquest which indicates the courtyard area is not safe. I have serious concerns that an urgent review of the courtyard is required. In addition, I heard evidence from Dr [REDACTED] that the fence was a ligature risk. Staff gave evidence that the courtyard in its current format with steps and a gradient on the grass bank was unsafe especially if a patient needed to be restrained.

Wade,Berkshire,Highways England,"On 17 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Zoltan TOROK, aged 42. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 March 2022.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Zoltan died on 7 May 2021 on the M4 motorway, Junction 5 towards Junction 6, Slough Berkshire from multiple injuries in a road traffic collision.","On 7 May 2021 at about 3pm Zoltan was driving his Honda motorcycle at a lawful speed westbound on the M4 motorway in the inner slow lane, along a part of the highway under construction and adaptation to be converted to a smart motorway, and which therefore had no hard shoulder/safety lane to his nearside, when he came upon a Land Rover Discovery motorcar which had suffered an unexpected and inexplicable mechanical defect rendering it not possible for it to proceed to a refuge but compelling it to come to a stop and remain broken down in the same westbound inner lane, just short of the exit sliproad at Junction 6. The driver and passenger of the Land Rover were able to leave the vehicle and find safety beyond the roadside barrier but their presence standing by the side of the motorway momentarily distracted Zoltan’s attention from the road ahead and he rode into the rear of the stationary Land Rover without decreasing his speed, causing catastrophic multiple injuries from which he died in the highway.","(1) On the date of the death the particular section of the M4 motorway was not completed as a smart motorway, but was substantially in course of conversion such that to all intents and purposes it had the intended characteristics of a smart motorway, specifically that there was no run-off lane or safety lane or hard shoulder, but all lanes were running lanes. The edge of the near side of the inner lane was a solid continuous concrete wall. The inquest heard evidence from the police collision investigator that the collision would not have occurred if the broken down Land Rover had been able to pull out of the running lane into a refuge or onto a traditional hard shoulder.
(2) The hazard created for moving traffic by the obstruction of the stranded vehicle was compounded by the unexpected proximity of the occupants from the stranded vehicle standing immediately next to the running lane, albeit on the safe side of the barrier, which is likely to have been distracting to drivers moving at a typical and lawful motorway speed, and on the evidence was a distraction to the deceased.
(3) In addition the court heard evidence from an experienced qualified mechanical engineer, fellow of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, with over 40 years of professional engagement in the motor industry, that the policy of mixing smart motorways with traditional hard shoulder motorways created a latent risk that road users will become accustomed to treating the left or inner lane of motorways as a live running lane even when it remains a conventional hard shoulder, thereby endangering road users who have to pull off the road onto the hard shoulder.
(4) The essential purpose of a motorway as a multi-lane high speed direct communication between locations likely to be long distances apart is both undermined, and has a tendency to potentiate risks to road users, if the running lanes are liable suddenly and unexpectedly to become blocked in a dynamic situation, with no refuge available to the stranded vehicle.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,42,Male,Driver

The medical cause of death provided by histopathologist, Dr. [REDACTED], Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital was:

1(a) Traumatic injuries

The Coroner’s short-form conclusion was that of “Road Traffic Collision”.","On 6 November 2020 the deceased was walking on the tow path alongside the Montgomeryshire Canal. She passed through a ‘kissing gate’ onto the B4398 with the intention of re-joining the towpath through a similar gate diagonally opposite on the other side of the road.

Mrs. Lewis was crossing the road, when a car driven at between 16.5–22 mph came round a bend and into the glare of low autumnal sun which dazzled the driver. Because of this, he did not see Mrs. Lewis crossing the road and the car struck her causing fatal injuries. Witnesses state that the car had a quiet engine which could not be heard at the time of the accident. Low sun with commensurate glare was confirmed by witnesses and within the Police Investigation Report.","The Montgomeryshire canal and its adjacent towpath is a popular venue for adults with children and dogs; and joggers, many of whom will wear earphones. They, like Mrs. Lewis who was thought to be wearing earphones at the time, will need to cross the B4398 (which has a 60 mph speed limit) to continue their exercise.

With the increasing popularity of noiseless electric cars, the frequency of wearing of earphones whilst taking exercise and the B4398 having a 60 mph speed limit, I consider there is a risk of reoccurrence of such an accident.

McLoughlin,Yorkshire West Eastern,The Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police; Regional Mayor for West Yorkshire,"On 11 June 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Andrew David Kitson, aged 44. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on Thursday 3 March 2022. The jury returned a narrative conclusion including a finding that he was unlawfully killed on 9 June 2020 after he sustained multiple injuries when struck by a motorcar being driven at high speed as it sought to flee from the police.","Around 5:20pm on Tuesday 9 June 2020, Mr Kitson was walking on the pavement of the A61 Leeds Road in the directions of Wakefield.

A Peugeot motorcar failed to stop when signalled to do so by police officers at approximately 5:17pm in respect of a mobile phone offence they had observed.

The police officer was authorised to pursue the Peugeot for a period of 2 minutes 42 seconds over a distance of some 2½ miles, during which time the Peugeot was driven dangerously and at high speed.

The Peugeot lost control, mounted the pavement and struck Mr Kitson, who sustained multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene at 5:50pm that day.","(1) The evidence taken at the inquest revealed insufficient statistical evidence was available to guide an evaluation of the proportion of spontaneous police pursuits which

(a) involve driving at high speeds through residential areas;
(b) result in the apprehension of an offender;
(c) result in personal injury to other road users or property damage;
(d) are aborted without the alleged offender being caught;

without such analytical feedback (ideally prepared on a national basis) the risks inherent in such pursuits, balanced against their effectiveness, cannot adequately be reviewed.

(2) The rules governing spontaneous police pursuits in residential areas place an onerous burden upon police drivers to review continuously the safety of proceeding whilst at the same time driving at high speed. The pursuit manager who authorises the continuance of a pursuit is dependent upon fragments of verbal messages relayed over the radio, due to the perceived need to leave airtime for other TPAC units to input information. The inquest heard evidence to the effect that real time camera pictures from the police vehicle are not always available due to IT issues. This means the pursuit manager must largely trust the judgement of the police driver.

In order to lessen the burden upon the police driver in having to weigh numerous factors in a continuing, complex judgement, consideration should be given to a refinement of the parameters in which pursuits in residential areas are permitted. Such guidance to pursuit managers (informed by data regarding the effectiveness and risks arising in previous pursuits) would help to promote consistency and lessen the dependence upon a case-by-case judgement made in a pressured timescale.",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,44,Male,Pedestrian

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on Friday, 25 February 2022.

It was put to me very forcefully by medical staff that, until the PEWS system moves to an electronic base as part of electronic recording of the paediatric records as a whole, monitoring and care of children may be sub optimal, with a higher risk of this sort of situation recurring.

2. The King’s serious incident investigation identified that Martha’s care fell down between the paediatric hepatologists and the paediatric intensivists. I heard evidence that it is the intention of King’s to improve the formal relationship between the hepatology and the paediatric intensive care departments, and to ensure that there is pro-active paediatric intensive care outreach.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 February 2022.,On 19 January 2021 Miss Brown was the unaccompanied driver of a motor car on the A6068 between Cowling and Glusburn travelling down an incline where the road surface was very wet due to heavy falls of rain. She lost control of the vehicle in the wet conditions and came into collision with an oncoming car. She suffered serious injuries in that collision from which she was recognised as deceased there at 12.49 hours that same afternoon.,"It is acknowledged that officers of the Highway Authority were not called to give evidence at the inquest hearing nor was the Authority designated as an interested person for the purposes of disclosure and participation at the hearing. There had been a written report collision ref 01-21 however from the Authority received at the hearing relating to the roadway being the “A6068 Colne Road between Carr Head Lane and New Hall Farm near Cowling/Crosshills, Craven District”

However the evidence revealed:
a) The particular stretch of the A6068 was known to local, and other motorists familiar with it, as being frequently incapable of adequately and safely clearing surface storm and rainwater off the carriageway surface, thereby to make the road as reasonably safe as possible for the passage of motor vehicles, especially those travelling down the incline (as was the deceased).
b) That water flowed and flows rapidly down the incline. It was (and is) not adequately regulated by drains and did not (and does not) get away. Instead water which came off (and comes off) adjacent land as well as the road itself accumulated (and accumulates) in volume. The want of appropriate cambers and slopes across the carriageway allowed (and allows) and indeed encouraged (and encourages) the water flow across the whole of the carriageway, rather than be conducted along drainage channels to the sides of the carriageway.
c) The profile of the roadway meant (and means) that the water was (and is likely to be) thrown back (and forth) across the carriageway. The evidence showed a heavy water flow spread right across the carriageway into the deceased’s path from the deceased’s offside to nearside. That had been from an accumulation of water after there was a flow nearside to offside a short distance back from the incident scene.
d) The process of simply cleaning out drains was not (and has not been) adequate to minimise the risk to road users. The evidence pointed to the need to make significant permanent road engineering alterations to the camber, layout, profile and slopes of the road surface and drains. The evidence indicated that the high levels of traversing water were not rare occurrences, creating what was found to be a ‘notoriety’. Climate change will increase the likelihood of adverse incidents such as was evidenced happening in the future, causing increased risk of death. The roadway here will remain a high risk, as it was for the deceased, for fatal accidents.
e) There were (and are) no signs/signage indicating the risk of the road ‘flooding’, whether temporary or permanent at this location. Those familiar with it, including the police expert, knew it for the past and present risk of loss of control. That should not mean the risk can be acceptable.
f) The Authority must consider promptly permanent road engineering solutions and implement those appropriate to make this road as safe as reasonably possible.",False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,21,Female,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 January 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Cloudsdale died as a result of a road traffic collision; the medical cause of death being severe head injuries.,"At approximately 5:30am on 11 November 2019, Stephen Cloudsdale had been travelling in the eastbound dual carriageway of the A66 at Stainmore in Cumbria. At the time, Mr Cloudsdale was travelling to his place of work in North Yorkshire, having set off from his home address in Millom. He was familiar with the road and with the controls and handling of his vehicle (a Ford Fiesta) which he had owned for approximately two years.

At the time of the incident, it was dark, and it was raining heavily.
As Mr Cloudsdale approached the Stainmore Café, which is set back from the dual carriageway to the left, he moved into the second lane of the dual carriageway in order to initiate an overtake of a vehicle travelling in the first lane. He was utilising his car’s dipped beams at this time, and it is estimated that he was travelling at a maximum speed of 75 mph.

As Mr Cloudsdale approached the area of the central reservation connecting the east and westbound dual carriageways, he collided with the rear offside corner of an LGV which was positioned in the central reservation waiting to turn right onto the westbound carriageway. The rear offside corner of the LGV encroached into lane 2 of the eastbound carriageway by approximately 1 metre.

Mr Cloudsdale sustained non-survivable traumatic head injuries as a result of the collision and death was diagnosed at the scene at 5:50am.","1) The lack of lighting near to or at the point of the A66 dual carriageway where the collision occurred which renders the presence of vehicles crossing the carriageway from the café difficult to see by approaching drivers during the hours of darkness and/or during adverse weather conditions.
2) The lack of appropriately positioned signage, warning approaching drivers of the possibility of vehicles crossing the carriageway from the café.
3) The speed of traffic on this stretch of the A66.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 January 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was as accident, and the medical cause of death was 1a) Traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage with burst lobe and II) Complications of bilateral lower limb fractures in an elderly man.","Mr Simmons was walking along the footpath on Beacon Hill Road, Plymouth PL2 3LU and had got as far as crossing with the junction on Montpellier Road when a driver of a red Astra motor vehicle came from the direction of Beacon Hill Road, turned right into Montpellier Road and struck Mr Simmons whilst he crossed Montpellier Road. The driver had cut the corner of the junction and instead of making a right hand turn into the left-hand side of Montpellier Road he had crossed into Montpellier Road by turning in on the incorrect right-hand side of the junction. As he did so he hit Mr Simmons who was half way across the road by the time the collision happened.

As the driver struck Mr Simmons he fell to the floor and became trapped under the front wheel of the car. Mr Simmons died of his injuries later in hospital. The driver was prosecuted in the Magistrates' Court, and it was revealed during the police investigation that there was no defect in the car, the driver provided a negative breath test and also passed the eyesight test at the scene. The driver accepted that he had not seen Mr Simmons and he was driving the car on a bright sunny morning with his sun visor down, the driver was not speeding or otherwise in a hurry.","(1) Acting Police Inspector [REDACTED] gave evidence to the inquest as follows:
1. In his opinion as Mr Simmons was at least half way across the road if the driver had not turned into the junction on the incorrect side of the road, he would have most likely avoided him

3. Double yellow lines in his opinion would not prevent a further accident of this nature.
4. A pedestrian refuge in the centre of the road on the junction of Montpellier Road and Beacon Park Road together with a keep left sign would prevent vehicles cutting the corner and causing a similar accident again.
5. There have been 3 collisions on this junction in the last 5 years, 2 of which have cited the sun as a contributory factor.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 September 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was: I a Drowning I b I c II,"Heike Mojay-Sinclare died on 9 December 2018 due to drowning when her car became stuck in high and rising flood water at a ford on Doles Lane near Ashbourne in Derbyshire. She had been travelling on 8 December 2018 from her home in Hertfordshire to stay at a Peak District cottage for a friend’s birthday celebration. It is not known why she was travelling on Doles Lane, having joined it at its junction with the A515, as the lane is a single carriage road, essentially an access road, and would not feature on a recommended route plan. She will not have been familiar with the lane. There was very high rainfall at the time Heike was in the vicinity of Doles Lane. A brook, classed as a river, crosses the lane and had flooded. The responsible local authority had installed ford warning signs on the lane and signs stating that it is unsuitable for motor vehicles. From Heike's comments to emergency services in a call from her car when in the water it appears she had noticed a ford sign. The ford has a depth gauge of two metres height sited in the usual course of the water but due to the extreme rise in water level it may not have been visible to Heike. The depth gauge had been installed by the local authority on account of a previous serious incident and concerns raised by residents and the parish council. It is not clear that the local authority was aware of a number of other previous incidents at the ford about which the inquest heard some details and those incidents may not have been shared by relevant agencies. The inquest was told that depth gauge requirements for fords currently lie outside of the regulatory regime for highways. As has been stated it is not clear why Heike was travelling on the lane. The driving conditions will have been very bad and it is unlikely that she will have appreciated the danger when she entered the ford in her car or the potential depth of the water. The water rose fast inside her car and she was very concerned with saving her two dogs in the rear of the car. The indication from the transcript of the call to emergency services is that she climbed through into the rear of the car to see to her dogs and then became stuck. Given the time of the sudden ending of Heike’s call to emergency services an effective rescue was impossible. Heike was pronounced dead when she was recovered from the water on the morning of 9 December 2018 but it is clear that she will have died during the late evening of 8 December 2018.","1. The inquest heard that with regard to water depth gauges, specifically for river fords, the Traffic Signs and General Directions 2016 removed prescription of the type of signs to be used and the requirement for their use at river ford crossings. Those requirements were in the previous 2002 Directions. There is relevant guidance (Ch.4 Traffic Signs Manual) but this is not mandatory and leaves enactment to the discretion of the relevant local authority. As water depth gauges are outside of the regulatory regime there may be fords without gauges, or where they are installed they may be sub-optimal and deficient. There is also lack of clarity for local authorities and the lack of a prescribed design and standard means that manufacturers do not have an approved design to work to and provide to local authorities.

2. The inquest heard that river fords and depth gauges do not currently lie within mandatory highways inspection requirements and therefore there is no guarantee of their maintenance and review, and therefore no guarantee that they continue to provide ongoing usability and safety.

3. The inquest heard that there were a number of previous serious incidents which it appears were not notified to the relevant local authority, and that if they had been there would likely have been a review of measures relating to the river ford. A mandatory requirement for inter-agency information sharing in these circumstances is indicated.

We the jury were unable to determine Josh’s state of mind at the time of his death.

The below contributing factors led to Josh’s death.
• Insufficient staffing
• Insufficient observations and 1 to 1’s
• Inadequate formal documentation
• No psychologist available.
• Unclear restricted items policy.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

1a Asphyxia

2 Psychosis","Joshua was a 25-year-old man who on the 2 August 2019 intentionally drove his car off a bridge on the A11 landing on the A14 dual-carriageway beneath.

This incident caused Joshua chest and pelvis injuries and as a result he was admitted to the Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge on the same day.

Whilst Joshua had been an inpatient at Addenbrookes he had been seen by a psychiatrist and deemed to be at a continuing high risk of self-harm.

As such, when Joshua was deemed medically fit, his discharge was directly to a psychiatric bed on Southgate Ward, Wedgewood House, Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk.

Joshua’s admission took place on the 9 August 2019 as an informal patient.

As Joshua was admitted directly from Addenbrookes he was in a hospital gown only, as his clothes had been cut from him when he arrived at Addenbrookes hospital from the scene of the road collision.

Joshua’s family were asked to take fresh clothes to Southgate ward, which they did in a plastic carrier bag. The bag was emptied by a member of staff, the contents were searched, re-packed and then taken to Josh’s room.

At this time plastic bags were a ‘restricted item’ on the ward, but Joshua’s family had not been told this.

On the 15 August 2019 Joshua was transferred to Northgate Ward, another ward within Wedgewood House.

On the 9 September 2019 at 17:07 Joshua was found in his room with bed sheet around his neck and the plastic carrier bag over his head.

CPR commenced by staff based on the ward and they were subsequently joined by paramedics.

Despite resuscitation attempts recognition of life extinct was timed at 17:45.

At the time of his death Joshua was on hourly observations on the ward.","Relate to the communication of what are ‘restricted and contraband items’ to the family and friends of a patient, before those family and friends visit the mental health ward.

This would be particularly important for a family or friend's first visit to the ward.

The court was told that there are signs up at the entrance of the ward detailing items that are ‘contraband’. These items are not allowed onto the ward in any circumstances.

This makes it clear to all visitors what cannot be taken onto the ward in any circumstances.

However, the court was told that a ‘restricted item’ regime also exists, under which patients are risk assessed, with some being allowed particular items (such as mobile phone charger leads, laptop leads, belts and lighters), whilst others are not.

From the evidence we heard in this case, we know that Josh’s clothes were taken onto the ward in a plastic carrier bag, which at the time was a restricted item.

We heard that the bag was emptied, the contents were searched, re-packed and then taken to Josh’s room.

From the investigation into this matter, it is apparent that firstly, that had the family known that a plastic carrier bag was a restricted item, it would not have been taken to the hospital in the first instance.

Secondly, that had the family been aware that a plastic carrier bag was a restricted item, even though they may have used one to deliver Josh’s clothes, they would have drawn staff attention to the bag when it was subsequently taken and left in Josh’s room.

During the evidence no clear system or procedure was identified, for a family to be notified of any particular items that have been deemed ‘restricted’ items for their loved one to have in their possession.

There was therefore no effective communication with the family regarding what items were, and what items were not, allowed onto the ward in Josh’s case.

I am therefore concerned that families and friends of current in-patients, may still inadvertently take a particular item onto ward, or be aware that their loved one has a particular item in their possession, yet be totally unaware that that particular item has been risk assessed as a restricted item for their loved one.

It is known that families and friends of in-patients can play a vital role in their care, treatment and recovery. However, without knowing what have been deemed ‘restricted items’ for their loved one, the ability to assist in keeping their loved one safe whilst an in-patient, is effectively removed from those family and friends.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,25,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 August 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was that:-

On 26 August 2020 Mr Pickering left home at approximately 22.20 with his girlfriend as a passenger. He was driving his Kia car towards Manningtree train station on the A137 near Tattingstone, Ipswich in order for her to depart on the 22.54 train.

At around 22.45 a road traffic collision occurred in the northbound lane near to Nine Oaks and Wallers Farm at the brow of the hill. The likely cause of this collision was due to the Kia overtaking a VW Golf despite the white lines, resulting in the collision with the oncoming Saab in an offset head-on impact. The speedometer of the Kia was recorded as 71mph and the speed limit at this section was 60mph.

Emergency services were called and fire crew service support was provided given that the Kia was inverted due to the collision and Mr Pickering remained upside down in the driving seat. Following his release from the car, paramedic support was then able to be assessed but Mr Pickering was recognised as passing away at 23.45 at the scene of the collision due to massive multiple injuries sustained.

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:

At the end of the inquest I concluded “Pathushan died as a result of an accident.”

Following the inquest, I indicated that I was minded to make a Regulation 28 report setting out my concerns surrounding the circumstances of Pathushan’s death.","On 22 July 2020 Pathushan was taking part in a charity cycle ride on the Downs Link in West Sussex. He was cycling on the stretch from Cranleigh towards Southwater when he went down a steep slope along the track that approached the junction with the A281. As he got close to the A281 it appears that he braked but lost control of his bike (probably caused by the gravel surface on the track). This caused him to fall from his bike with a forward momentum pushing him out into the road directly into the path of a Heavy Goods Vehicle being driven along the A281.

There is no physical barrier in place and the signage in the lead up to the junction at the time to warn users on the Downs Link of the immediacy of a major A-road was inadequate.

Following Pathushan’s death a post mortem examination was carried out and this showed the cause of death was due to 1a blunt head injury.","Whilst it was accepted that West Sussex County Council had, following Pathushan’s death, made significant improvements to the junction between the Downs Link and the A281, evidence was heard from a number of different organisations (speaking on behalf of all the different users of the Downs Link) that the junction in question still posed a substantial risk for cyclists, pedestrians and equestrians alike.

This junction is the only part of the Downs Link that crosses a major A-road where there is no alternative safe crossing, a Pegasus crossing or bridge. Evidence was heard that there is no pavement running alongside the A281 and therefore this causes poor sight lines for horse riders and, in some circumstances, cyclists who have to put their horse’s head or part of their bike out onto the road before they can see oncoming traffic.

It is understood that WSCC has identified a need to address the issues at this junction and has undertaken (or is about to undertake a feasibility study) but it appears that at this stage there are no definitive plans in place to take this forward. Therefore the significant risk to the users of this junction remains.

• There was no evidence of excessive speed or unsafe driving by Ryan at the time of the collision or in the period leading up to the collision. Indeed, there was evidence from other road users that Ryan was driving appropriately for the conditions.

• There was meteorological evidence a large band of heavy rain passing over the location of the collision and that just prior to the collision rainfall of 20 - 30 mm was recorded. Eyewitnesses referred to the driving conditions as being poor due to the heavy rain and excessive water.

• Examination of road drainage at this location revealed that during periods of heavy rainfall surface water from the adjoining road known as Coliza Hill is likely to converge with surface water on the A390 in the vicinity of where the Jaguar initially lost control.

• Ryan was driving a rear wheel drive car. The evidence of the forensic collision investigator was that a rear wheel drive car is more likely to aquaplane in these circumstances than a front wheel drive car.

• The manner in which Ryan’s car crossed the carriageway was found to be consistent with a rear wheel drive car aquaplaning in wet conditions. The forensic collision investigator’s evidence was that Ryan would have had little or no warning of this sudden loss of control.

From these findings of fact driver error was ruled out.

Mr Breakell appears to have fallen into the storm drain and landed on one of the concrete paving slabs, resulting in the significant injuries that led to his death.","(1) Although there is now wooden fencing that runs from the end of the paved footpath in a northerly direction (adjacent to the pedestrian crossing), there is still no barrier between the highway and the storm drain where there is no paved area; that is, from the start of the exit from the A338 to the paved footpath adjacent to the pedestrian crossing. The evidence I heard at the inquest from the investigating police officer is that cyclists use the A338 and the Blackwater Junction exit. There remains a risk that if a cyclist left the paved highway for any reason, he or she would be at risk of falling into the storm drain. In addition, if a vehicle lost control at the exit, that vehicle is at risk of leaving the highway and falling into the storm drain.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 May 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was:

Road traffic collision

The lorry from which the piece of concrete fell had a portion of its load which was uncovered and which was above the level of the sides of the vehicle. The piece of concrete which caused the collision came from the uncovered portion of the load.","Mr Steven Oscroft was driving his car along Netherfield Lane on 7 July 2020. He negotiated a right hand lane when a lorry was passing in the opposite direction. Both the lorry and Mr Oscroft’s vehicles were being driven appropriately for the applicable speed restrictions and weather conditions.

The lorry travelling in the opposite direction shed a piece of concrete about 20 cm in maximum width. This smashed through the windscreen and struck Mr Oscroft in the head, killing him instantly.","Paul Wainwright Construction Services Ltd

Evidence was heard regarding the training and practices of loading tipper lorries at Paul Wainwright Construction Services Ltd.

1. Loads are ‘mounded’ such that in the middle of the load area, the height of the load extends above the level of the sides, whilst being below the level of the sides at the point at which the load contacts the side. Part of the load is therefore above the level of the sides, increasing the risk of items on the load falling or blowing off the vehicle.

2. Industry standard sheeting systems are in use which, when the load is ‘mounded’ in this way, causes the sheet to be drawn up. This results in part of the load being uncovered and liable to fall or be blown from the vehicle.

3. Such standard sheeting systems are not designed to be used on loads mounded above the level of the sides and cannot prevent ‘blow off’ from the areas of the load uncovered by the mesh.

4. Evidence was adduced of a number of loads on Wainwrights lorries which, because of the above practice, appeared to not be fully secure.

Evidence was heard regarding the manner in which loose materials are loaded and secured onto tipper lorries.

1. The above-mentioned practice of ‘mounding’ loads above the level of the sides is standard practice within the industry.

2. Mesh sheeting systems are commonly deployed in circumstances when the mesh does not cover all of the material being carried.

Cox,Greater Manchester North,Highways England; North West Motorway Police Group,On 15 March 2021 I concluded an inquest into the death of Lee David Marsden who died on 20 December 2019. I reached the following conclusion: Road Traffic Collision,"The deceased was seen accessing an area between junctions 2 and 3 of the M66 motorway on foot at 20:04 hours on 20 December 2019.

The North West Motorway Police Group (NWMPG) notified Highways England of the sighting via electronic interface at 20:05:28 hours. As a result of this communication, Highways England set advisory speed limits of 60 mph between junctions 2 and 3 at 20:08:01 hours. Two further reports of sightings were made, one of which (at 20:10 hours) was by an off-duty police officer who asked that consideration be given to imposing a speed limit of 30 mph at junction 3. NWMPG updated Highways England of these reports using the prefix 06/8126 to indicate that one of the informants was a police officer. The significance of the prefix 06/8126 was not appreciated by Highways England.

The evidence was that had Highways England appreciated that the informant was a police officer, the speed limit would have been set at 30 mph between junctions 2 and 3 with a target time for implementation of 2 minutes. This would have meant that the 30 mph speed limit would have been in place by 20:12:58 hours.

At 20:16 hours, the deceased was struck by a vehicle in the third lane of the northbound carriageway. His body was projected into the southbound carriageway where other vehicles collided with him. He sustained fatal injuries and his life was pronounced extinct at the scene.

At 20:22:17 hours, almost six minutes after the impact, an advisory speed limit was set on both carriageways by Highways England between junctions 2 and 3.

Evidence from the Forensic Collision Investigator was that had the speed limit of 30 mph been in place, the deceased would have had a greater chance of avoiding the impact.","1. There was a delay in activating the warning signals to reduce the speed of traffic travelling along the M66 motorway between junctions 2 and 3 to 30 mph.

2. The efficacy of communication between Highways England and North West Motorway Police Group in that there was a failure to appreciate the significance of the prefix numbers 06/8126.

The investigation concluded at the end of the criminal proceedings on 13 July 2020. As a consequence of convictions being recorded in respect of causing death by dangerous driving (and other associated matters relating to this collision), and the facts having been fully ventilated in the Isle of Wight Crown Court before sentence on 13 July 2020, I have considered that it is not appropriate for me to resume the inquest proceedings in this case.","On Sunday 14 April 2019 Mrs Yvonne Copland and her husband [REDACTED] were conveying their son [REDACTED] and his partner [REDACTED] to Yarmouth in [REDACTED] red Fiat Bravo motor car index [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] was the driver of this vehicle with [REDACTED] as the front seat passenger. Yvonne Copland and [REDACTED] were rear seat passengers. The vehicle left the family home address in Newport, Isle of Wight just before 13:00 hours. The vehicle was travelling in a westerly direction along the A3054 towards Shalfleet and Yarmouth.

Whilst travelling along the A3054 and at the junction of Forest Road and Whitehouse Road a collision took place with a double-decker bus index [REDACTED] being driven by [REDACTED] and a silver Mini Cooper index [REDACTED] being driven by [REDACTED]. The silver Mini Cooper was travelling south along Whitehouse Road towards the A3057 from the direction of Great Thorness. [REDACTED] was unfamiliar with the road layout and failed to see or act upon the road signage indicating that there was a junction ahead at which she needed to give way. In so doing she has collided with the double-decker bus driving east along the A3054 from Shalfleet towards Newport. In an attempt to avoid a collision with [REDACTED] vehicle as it emerged into the junction without stopping from the A3057 into the A3054 immediately in front of the bus, the bus driver instinctively swerved to the right and in doing so he was completely unable to avoid colliding with the vehicle containing Mrs Copland and her family.

Police and ambulance crews were quickly on scene and further support was requested including 4 air ambulances. Upon their arrival, ambulance staff noted that Yvonne Copland had been removed from her husband’s car and was being given CPR by members of the public. Paramedics and other medical support took over providing emergency medical treatment for Yvonne Copland but sadly she was pronounced dead at the scene at 13:16 hours.","1. In her sentencing remarks, Her Hon Judge [REDACTED] QC said: “…It is right and fair that I should make the observation that this is not, perhaps, the easiest of junctions. It is not the first time that a serious road traffic collision has taken place at this particular junction.

2. “Whitehouse Lane has high hedges and it does not afford a good view of the major road, although an approaching double-decker bus would probably have been visible to you. In addition to that the road may be somewhat deceptive when travelling along Whitehouse Lane in that a person who fails to observe the signage and the road markings could read the road as continuing straight across, which is the way in which you recall reading the road, and I accept that, coupled with your over reliance on the audio of your satellite navigation system, that is how you saw it, having failed to observe the clear warnings on the approach to the junction. Two “Give Way” signs, road markings and a change of surface.

3. “It is incumbent upon a driver to observe the road and most importantly the road signage, the road markings and the change of road surface, which were clear. In addition to that, three or four seconds before you reached the junction, another vehicle emerged from the road opposite Whitehouse Lane and should have been a visible warning to you. You were, however, a very inexperienced driver which may have contributed to your error. By the time you realised what was happening, it looks like you must have braked hard at that point, it was too late.”

4. In the aftermath of the crash, a petition was launched which gained nearly 7,000 signatures calling for the Isle of Wight Council to install traffic lights at the crossroads, in a bid to improve road safety and prevent further collisions.

5. Accident data from the Isle of Wight Council and Island Roads show there is a ‘high probability’ of a crash occurring at that junction at least once every year, and it is ‘likely’ that between 25% and 50% of those accidents could kill or seriously injure someone.

6. In the last 5 years, I am informed that there have been 7 recorded collisions which have occurred at this junction – the one involving Mrs COPLAND was clearly one where a fatality occurred, and number of others were seriously injured in this incident. I also understand that there have been 3 other serious collisions at this location with 6 of those collisions involving vehicles exiting Whitehouse Road on to Forest Road.

7. Forest Road is the main strategic route from Newport to the West Wight and is thought to be used by approximately 10,000 vehicles a day and its junction with Whitehouse Road is currently in the top 10 potential safety schemes on the Island’s Highways Safety and Improvement Register.

Misadventure contributed to by neglect","On 5 April 2018, Mr Gates crossed the A2 High Street, Newington Kent, passing in front of a HGV which was waiting at temporary traffic lights set up to manage traffic flow whilst the carriageway was excavated to repair a leaking water pipe.

As he crossed directly in front of the vehicle, it was beckoned forward by the traffic management operative, clipping Mr Gates’ shoulder and causing him to fall to the kerb and sustain injury.

He was admitted to Medway Maritime Hospital by ambulance and was diagnosed with fracture of the right proximal femur, which was known to carry a high risk of bleeding, such risk being increased by reason of Mr Gates’ age and coronary artery disease.

He was appropriately managed and admitted to the ward at approximately 1 am on 6 April 2018, with a plan to operate later that day.

Throughout, Mr Gates’s blood pressure had been low and although his NEWS score had been zero at the point of entry to the hospital it had risen to 3 at the time he was transferred to the ward.

It subsequently dropped to a score of 2 which pursuant to the NEWS protocol required 2 hourly observations as a minimum. In any event the observation rate had been set at every 2 hours by treating clinicians due to the need to monitor for any deterioration due to bleeding at the fracture.

Those observations were undertaken until 6.30 am on 6 April 2018 after which they were not performed again until 1.15 pm (nearly 7 hours later) when it was recorded that Mr Gates’ blood pressure had dropped such that it was apparent that there was a significant and serious bleed from the fracture site and which required immediate medical intervention. His deterioration during this 7 hour period had not been identified.

Despite appropriate management including transfusions Mr Gates continued to decline and arrested at approximately 3.45 pm and died despite resuscitation attempts.

Stoate,Bedfordshire and Luton,Highways England,"On 6 December 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Zahid Ahmed, aged 19. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 January 2021.

The conclusion of the inquest was road traffic collision.","On the afternoon of 1 December 2019, Zahid Ahmed (where relevant, “the deceased”), aged 19 years, was a passenger in the rear nearside passenger seat of a blue Kia Sedona multi-person vehicle with five other occupants.

Whilst it was on the smart motorway at the M1 South Junction 11a, the Kia suffered a mechanical defect which caused it to lose power and the engine check light to illuminate on the instrument panel.

The Kia exited the main carriageway and entered an Emergency Refuge Area (ERA), where it remained stationary for approximately 12 seconds. The Kia re-entered the main carriageway and, shortly after, its hazard lights were illuminated. The Kia then stopped in lane one, approximately 145m south of the ERA, a section operating as a running lane with no hard shoulder. Three other vehicles were able to avoid colliding with the Kia.

At approximately 15:15 hours, a Polish registered black Scania R450 articulated heavy goods vehicle travelling at 56 MPH hit the rear of the Kia causing significant damage, and causing Mr Ahmed multiple traumatic injuries. At 16:37 hours a paramedic examined the body of the deceased at the scene and confirmed his death.

The road surface was good, and the weather conditions were cold but clear and dry. As the Kia was stationary and the parking brake applied, Mr Ahmed had probably removed his seatbelt (although I concluded in any event that a seatbelt would not have made any difference to the injuries he sustained).

The driver of the Scania had a clear and unobstructed view, allowing him between approximately 8 and 10 seconds to identify and react to the presence of the Kia, and to use the road space and time available either to stop safely in lane one or to move into lane two in order to avoid the collision.

The collision occurred primarily due to the failure of the Scania driver to perceive and respond to the presence of the Kia in enough time to avoid a collision, and also due to the presence of the Kia in a running lane of the motorway as no alternative was available to the driver after leaving the ERA.

The cause of Mr Ahmed’s death was determined to be:

Ia Multiple traumatic injuries
Ib
Ic
II","1) The stretch of the M1 motorway where this fatal collision occurred is part of the ‘Managed Motorway’, which runs from Junction 13 to Junction 10. It features variable speed limits and, in places, an ‘actively managed hard shoulder’, which is a hard shoulder that in certain circumstances may be driven on. Variable speed limit and ‘hard shoulder running’ information is conveyed to drivers via electronic matrix signals message boards, and verge signs positioned along the Managed Motorway. These signals are controlled by operators within the Highways Agency Eastern Regional Control Centre (ERCC). At around 400m south of the Toddington Services southbound entry, the hard shoulder commences and is managed for a distance of around 1.1 km, before the motorway becomes designated ‘All Lanes Running’ (ALR) again around 500m north of Junction 11a. Travelling south from Junction 12, however, the motorway is ALR, and there is no hard shoulder.

2) Detective Constable [REDACTED], of the Bedfordshire Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit, gave evidence at Mr Ahmed’s inquest as follows: “The absence of a hard shoulder contributed to the collision. Had the [deceased’s] vehicle been able to stop in a location other than a live lane, the offending HGV would not have driven into the back of it”.

3) The vehicle in which the deceased was a passenger suffered a mechanical defect which caused it to lose power. It is not clear where the vehicle could have pulled to a halt in a safe place in these circumstances, given that there was no hard shoulder and all lanes were live.

The incident occurred at a time when he was located within the vehicle's blind spot. Mitigating measures to reduce the risk of collisions with pedestrians were not actioned at the time of the incident. They, and the associated/applicable risk assessment were, in any event, in conflict with Rule 202 Highway Code, as the driver could not have seen clearly whilst reversing, and this likely contributed to his death.","(1) DPRA's do not mandate discussion with and documenting of, by the Risk Assessor, the views and experiences of the store owner/operator, nor of the drivers regularly delivering to the store, in relation to any particular hazards, or concerns. The Risk Assessor may not, therefore, be sufficiently informed of material which might assist him, or her in completing an adequate risk assessment.

(2) The mitigating/control measures set out in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 DPRA's do not adequately address the risks of vehicles colliding with pedestrians, in circumstances where the latter are located within vehicle blind spots. The measures, I understood from the evidence of the 2017 and 2019 Assessor, remain unchanged, and I believe, may well extend to all such DPRA's, and not limited to the Blandy Terrace delivery location.

(3) 360 degree checks cannot be undertaken by a driver, whilst in the process of conducting a reversing manoeuvre, unless mitigating measures such as reversing cameras or a banksman are deployed

Salter,Oxfordshire,"Oxfordshire County Council, Chief Executive","On 30 July 2020 I opened an inquest into the death of David Lewis. The inquest concluded on 14 January 2021 with a hearing at Oxford Coroners Court. Mr Lewis was 60 years old when he died at the scene of a road traffic accident at Vendee Drive, Bicester.

The conclusion of the inquest was ‘Road Traffic Collision’ with the following factual findings:

At approximately 22.05 on 16 July 2020 David Lewis was driving north from junction 9 of the M40 motorway towards Bicester on the A41 when he overshot the roundabout at Vendee Drive at speed causing his vehicle to become air borne and land upside down. He sustained a head injury and died at the scene.

I heard evidence from three witnesses at inquest along with other written statements and reports. One of the witnesses who gave oral evidence was [REDACTED], Group Manager, Area Operations, Highways, at Oxfordshire County Council. The other two were [REDACTED] of Hampshire and Thames Valley Joint Roads Policing and [REDACTED], Police Collision Investigator. I attach copies of their statements and reports for your information.","Mr Lewis was driving his vehicle on 16 July 2020 when he overshot the roundabout at Vendee Drive, Bicester at speed. It appears that he failed to detect the presence of the roundabout on his approach. It is noteworthy that he was intoxicated with alcohol and was one and a half times the legal limit for driving. However, it will be noted from pages 6 and 7 of Mr Croxton’s report that there is a significant history of very similar accidents with cars overshooting this roundabout, this includes a double fatality on 12 June 2019.","(1) It will be seen from paragraph 18 of [REDACTED] statement that a few days after this tragic accident there were amendments in the form of a reduction in the speed limit on approach to the roundabout. I understand these amendments were likely to be the result of a review which took place after a double fatality in 6/2019. I am concerned that despite improved signage and reduced speed limits there is still the danger of drivers not noticing the roundabout in sufficient time. Importantly, it is noticed that the roundabout is approached from around a bend or deflection.

It appears that more may be required in terms of engineering. One possibility that was mentioned by [REDACTED] was that consideration could be given to rumble strips/bars on the road surface which could give drivers an auditory warning in addition to visual warning.

It is not for me to make a recommendation, but I do have a duty to request a review and response. I will be interested to learn if the addition of rumble strips/bars or any other engineering improvements might be considered with a view to reducing the prospect of any similar incident in the future.",False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,60,Male,Driver

The conclusions were unlawful killing, copies attached.","On 7.6.19 a minor collision in the outside lane occurred between vehicles driven by Mr Mercer and Mr Murgeanu on the M1 Northbound between Junctions 34 and 35. This section of the M1 is an “all lane running” motorway, commonly referred to as a “Smart Motorway”.

The drivers pulled over to the left lane to exchange details. They stopped in what was an active lane even though a “refuge” was available a mile further up the road.

About 6 minutes later, after other vehicles had managed, albeit with some difficulty, to avoid their parked vehicles, they were struck by a Mercedes goods vehicle. Both Mr Mercer and Mr Murgeanu died at the scene.

Whilst the main cause of the tragedy was the careless driving of the driver of Mercedes goods vehicle, the inquest heard and accepted evidence that the lack of a hard shoulder due to the road being a smart motorway contributed to their deaths.","During the inquest, evidence showed:

• The obvious and foreseeable risk posed by the absence of a hard shoulder on smart motorways;

• The confusion caused to motorists posed by a mixture of smart motorways and traditional motorways

• The need for better driver awareness on the use of smart motorways

• The need for Highways England to be better able to identify stationary vehicles

• The need for better driver awareness of the need, where possible, to get over the crash barrier on all motorways, not just smart motorways

• The need for a wider review / inquiry into smart motorways for the following reasons:
  o Coroners only conduct inquests for deaths that occur in their coronial area (unless there is a body transfer) and given smart motorways exist across England and Wales, coroners do not and cannot have an effective and consistent overview of the whole of England and Wales
  o An inquest is confined to consider the facts insofar as they relate to the death(s) before him or her in order to answer the four statutory questions. It must not consider wider issues.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 December 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion: Mr Taylor died as a result of suicide. He took his own life following life changing injuries sustained during a road traffic collision. The injuries sustained in the collision caused a functional neurological disorder manifesting in refractory pain and sensory disturbances. These, in turn, led to psychological distress and suicidal ideation. Mr Taylor sought help for his pain and psychological distress. Long-term psychological therapy was required. The required help was not provided to him. In August 2019, Mr Taylor attended a long awaited multi-disciplinary programme for functional neurological disorder. He had attended preparatory sessions for the in-patient programme, to determine his suitability. The extent of his pain was not explored at the preparatory sessions and his engagement in the programme was terminated after 4 days, due to pain limiting his engagement. It is clear from communication left by Mr Taylor that the feeling of rejection from this programme contributed to his decision to take his own life.","The immediate circumstances of the death can be seen from the narrative conclusion set out above. In relation to the primary health care provided to Mr Taylor, concerns were raised by his family and friends in relation to the number of different general practitioner surgeries involved in his care and the lack of continuity of care.

The GP confirmed that no summary of care is provided to GP practices when transfer of patients take place. He confirmed the dangers of this, in that important clinical matters can be missed where a patient has a large volume of records. The general practitioner indicated that handover summaries should be provided to GPs when complex patients are transferred from surgery to surgery.

The incident involved 5 vehicles in total, one of which struck the vehicle in which Mr Turner was travelling in the opposite direction, head on, causing him fatal injuries. The incident was triggered when a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction went out of control and rammed the vehicle in front, pushing it into the path of the vehicle in which Mr Turner was travelling. The driver of the vehicle that struck Mr Turner’s could not take avoiding action to prevent the collision.

He surrendered his driving licence for 12 months from 30 October 2015. He applied to re-instate it in August 2016 and on 1 October 2016 he was issued with a restricted period driving licence. He was therefore lawfully holding a valid driving licence at the time of the incident. He was taking his medication as prescribed at the time of the incident.

He is a person of good character with no driving convictions of any sort. The evidence from the police collision investigator was to the effect that his vehicle was so seriously out of control that an epileptic seizure is very plausible.

The evidence heard was that it would appear to be confusing that a warning to SLOW was displayed when the immediately adjacent signs were confirming a change in speed limit from 30 to 60 mph.

Evidence was also heard that at the collision location near Whit’s Hill on the A689 road between the 2 villages there is a bend where forward visibility is reduced.

Bennett,Birmingham and Solihull,"Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, Minister for Transport, Department of Transport; Drivers and Vehicle Standards Agency",On 19/04/2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mollie Matilda Gifford. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 29 September 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was: ‘Died from unknown causes after being admitted to hospital with trauma caused during a road traffic collision.’,"On 16 March 2018 Mollie was waiting at a traffic light controlled pedestrian crossing on Bromford Lane. A large goods vehicle, travelling towards Erdington, approached from the nearby junction with Washwood Heath Road and came to a halt 4 meters beyond the stop line. The cab had standard class 5 and 6 mirrors to assist the driver with visibility around the cab whilst stationary. It is unknown how close Mollie was to the cab as she crossed the road, but the closer she was the less visible she would have been to the driver. Mollie was walking slowly and was in front of the cab when the lights changed to green. The driver was unaware of Mollie and drove into her as he pulled away at slow speed. Mollie was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. She had suffered significant rib fractures, including a flail segment, and an associated haemothorax. She required a total right arm amputation following severe comminuted displaced fractures to her arm and hand. She had a number of complications including intermittent atrial fibrillation, breathing difficulties, a blood clot in her remaining left arm, and she suffered a small stroke. By 26 March there was some improvement in her condition, she was moving both lower limbs and remaining upper limb, and was alert and co-operative. On 28 March she was transferred to a general ward. However, she became symptomatic of a chest infection and deteriorated, dying at 9.50pm on 29 March. A standard post-mortem was performed and offered a cause of death relating to the trauma caused by the collision. There was no examination of the brain and no histology of the lungs. Two forensic pathologists conducted a paper review and disagreed with the stated cause of death. Whilst they felt the chest was the most likely cause of death, they could not say so with certainty. Therefore, the cause of death and role of the collision remains unknown.","I heard evidence from [REDACTED], a forensic collision investigator of 15 years’ experience. Mr [REDACTED] previously served for 23 years as a police officer involved in road traffic investigation and reconstruction – for the last 5 years he was in charge of a police collision investigation unit. Mr [REDACTED] explained that the lorry cab was fitted with standard class 5 and 6 mirrors. He estimated in his career he had been involved in around 150 collisions between lorries and other road users and pedestrians where the class 5 and 6 mirrors did not provide the cab driver with adequate vision. The mirrors are convex and therefore even when clean provide a distorted view, but as they are prone to collect road dirt and spray, the distortion is easily amplified, making it difficult for cab drivers to see movement and colour. Some cab drivers will have a false sense of security about the ability of class 5 and 6 mirrors to provide a comprehensive view of other road users and pedestrians around the cab when stationary. Mr [REDACTED] went on to explain that camera units are available on the market to stream live footage of around the cab to the driver on a screen. Camera units offer a clearer view, are not subject to the same distortion as class 5 and 6 mirrors and it is easier to pick out movement and different colours.

My ongoing concern is that standard class 5 and 6 mirrors create an avoidable risk cab drivers will not see other road users and pedestrians in close proximity to the cab when stationary.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Female,Pedestrian

II","Mr Kusiak left a bar in Durham city centre at approximately 01:30hrs on 23/01/2020 and began walking home towards his address in Cooper Square, Gilesgate.

At about 02:20hrs, the driver of a motor vehicle observed Mr Kusiak in his headlights. Mr Kusiak was standing (or walking slowly in the direction of Durham towards oncoming traffic) on the central lane markers of the eastbound dual carriageway of the A690 between the Gilesgate roundabout and the Belmont overbridge.

Almost immediately thereafter, a second motorist struck Mr Kusiak, who had moved into the nearside lane (Lane 1) of the A690, at a point approximately 245 metres northeast of a pedestrian crossing point on the carriageway. Mr Kusiak sustained fatal injuries, from which he died later in hospital.

The relevant stretch of the A690 is unlit. Footage from the dashboard mounted camera in the impact vehicle showed that Mr Kusiak was not visible to the driver of the impact vehicle until he was only 29 metres away.","The evidence established that the collision between Mr Kusiak and a motor vehicle occurred on an unlit dual carriageway subject to the national speed limit that runs alongside a housing estate and an industrial estate in Belmont. It is foreseeable that pedestrians will attempt to cross the road.

The evidence established that at the point in the road where the impact occurred, a pedestrian was visible to a car being driven appropriately with headlights on and well within the prescribed speed limit only at a distance of 29 metres. The emergency stopping distance for such a car is between 75 and 87 metres.

There is no footpath alongside the A690 along the stretch where the accident occurred.

Grant Shapps MP),"On 13 September 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joan Williams aged 83 who died from her injuries along with her husband (a front-seat passenger in her car) following a road traffic accident. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 June 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was road traffic collision. The medical cause of death was:

Ia Hospital acquired pneumonia
Ib Bilateral rib fractures","At around 11.40 hours on 19 August 2019, the Deceased was driving her Vauxhall Corsa southbound on the A5120 from Flitwick toward Westoning when it collided head on with a heavy goods vehicle travelling northbound. Although the driver of the heavy goods vehicle took all possible evasive action the collision could not be avoided as it appeared she had not recognised what was going to occur. She was taken by paramedics to Addenbrookes hospital where she was diagnosed with multiple injuries including rib and long bone fractures and subsequently passed away on 3 September 2019; her death being confirmed at 16:43 hours. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia in April 2018 but had seemed to have trouble accepting this; although she had been advised by her diagnosing clinician and GP to inform the DVLA and her insurance company of her diagnosis, and had apparently confirmed that she would do so, she had also appeared confused by the process and had continued to deny her diagnosis and, on occasion, to drive. By the time of the incident the DVLA had still not been informed of her diagnosis.","(1) It was the expert opinion of the Road Traffic Collision Investigator that “the collision resulted from a loss of control by the driver of the Vauxhall Corsa (the deceased), however, the cause has not been identified. It is thought most likely to have resulted from driver confusion due to her dementia……”

(2) The Inquest learned that following the deceased’s diagnosis with Alzheimer’s dementia in 4/2018, and the advice provided by the Memory Assessment Service that she should contact the DVLA and cease driving in the meantime, her GP, Dr Chowdhury, discovered that she was continuing to drive. Although he spoke directly to her on 10/5/2018 and was reassured that she understood the advice and would be both contacting the DVLA and ceasing from driving, it appeared from other evidence that this, in fact did not occur; the deceased neither contacted the DVLA and, on occasion (apparently for short journeys), continued to drive.

(3) Current legislation makes the driver legally responsible for telling the DVLA or DVA about Alzheimer’s dementia. Doctors are only required to alert patients to such a condition that can affect their ability to drive and to remind them of their duty to tell the appropriate agency. Doctors are only told that they should disclose this information directly to the DVA or DVLA without consent if they are aware that the patient is continuing to drive and they consider it to be in the public interest to do so;

(4) The Alzheimer’s Society reports that, in 2013, there were 815,827 people with dementia in the UK (including 1 in every 14 of the population aged 65 years and over) and that, if current trends continue, the number of people with dementia in the UK is forecast to increase to 1,142,677 by 2025 and 2,092,945 by 2051, which will be an increase of 40% over the next 12 years and of 156% over the next 38 years.

(5) GPs are extremely busy professionals and may not always be made aware of a patient’s day to day activities. It was discussed at the Inquest that this tragedy, which involved not only the death of the deceased but also the death of her husband, might suggest that the public interest could be better served by the introduction of legislation to require all such diagnoses to be referred directly to the DVA/DVLA from the Memory Assessment Clinic and/or GP.",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,83,Female,Driver

The medical cause of death was found to have been:

1a. Adult respiratory distress syndrome and cerebral infarction
1b. Multiple traumatic injuries
2. Pulmonary tuberculosis

Newman,Lancashire and Blackburn with Darwen,The Right Honourable Grant Shapps - Secretary of State for Transport,On 15 May 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Russell Curwen aged 49. An inquest has yet to be concluded.,"On Saturday 5 May 2018 Mr Curwen, a volunteer with the North West Blood Bikes, was transporting blood samples from 5 patients at the Westmoreland General Hospital to the out-of-hours biochemistry unit at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. He was riding a BMW red and yellow liveried blood bike R1200, equipped with blue flashing lights and sirens. At around 19:45 he was riding his bike along the A6 Caton Road, Lancaster, using the fitted sirens and lights. Whilst travelling through the junction of the A683 and A589 he travelled through a traffic light, against the lights, colliding with a vehicle travelling through the lights, causing injuries that proved fatal later at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary.","The samples being transported by Mr Curwen were routine in nature, transported under a contract of courier services, as agreed between the North West Blood Bikes and University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, Southport and Ormskirk Hospitals, Lancashire Teaching Hospital, East Lancashire Hospital Trust and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

During the transfer lights and sirens fitted to the motorcycle provided by the North West Blood Bikes were activated.

The current legislation, as I understand provides exemptions to speed limits and permits the use of the emergency lighting. In terms of those exemptions and permissions it is my understanding that those are subject to:

Speed limits - Emergency vehicles are exempted from speed limits by s.87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Sub-sections (1A) and (1B) were added to s.87 by s.50(5) of the Deregulation Act 2015. The addition included the words emphasised in bold below.

“87. Exemption of fire brigade, ambulance and police vehicles from speed limits.
(1) No statutory provision imposing a speed limit on motor vehicles shall apply to any vehicle on an occasion when it is being used for fire and rescue authority, ambulance or police purposes, if the observance of that provision would be likely to hinder the use of the vehicle for the purpose for which it is being used on that occasion.

(1A) Subsection (1) above applies in relation to a vehicle that, although not being used for ambulance purposes, is being used for the purpose of providing a response to an emergency at the request of an NHS ambulance service.
(1B) In subsection (1A), “an NHS ambulance service” means—
(a) an NHS trust or NHS foundation trust established under the National Health Service Act 2006 which has a function of providing ambulance services; ….”

Blue lights - The use of blue lights is governed by reg.16 of the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989/1796, as interpreted by reg.3. Blue warning lights may only be used by “emergency vehicles”. Again, words were added into this legislation by the Deregulation Act 2015, by Sch.9 para.11(3), including the words emphasised below in bold:

“16. Restrictions on fitting blue warning beacons, special warning lamps and similar devices
No vehicle, other than an emergency vehicle or a vehicle used for special forces purposes, shall be fitted with—
(a) a blue warning beacon or special warning lamp, or
(b) a device which resembles a blue warning beacon or a special warning lamp, whether the same is in working order or not.

3. Interpretation
“Emergency vehicle”
A vehicle of any of the following descriptions—
(aza) a vehicle used for ambulance purposes or for the purpose of providing a response to an emergency at the request of an NHS ambulance service;
(b) an ambulance, being a vehicle (other than an invalid carriage) which is constructed or adapted for the purposes of conveying sick, injured or disabled persons and which is used for such purposes;”

My concerns are fourfold:

1) That the exemptions all relate to actions requiring an emergency response at the request of an NHS ambulance service: - There appears to be no traceable or auditable co-ordination or control of the allocation or dispatch of vehicles by a NHS ambulance trust control centre. Allocation or dispatch appears to be actioned at the request of the four NHS trusts contracted to with North West Blood Bikes under contracts for courier services;

2) That there is no definition of what constitutes an emergency and in the cases of courier services no apparent auditable or co-ordinated determination of what is classified as an emergency in these cases: - In this instance it was identified that Mr Curwen was transporting blood samples for 5 patients from one hospital to another who provided for weekend cover. There does not appear to be any determination by an NHS Ambulance Trust co-ordinator or control room supervisor, or even a recorded clinical decision as to whether the situation truly requires an “emergency” response. It is not suggested at present that the samples were required for life saving treatment, or that delays could significantly reduce the life expectancy of the patients.

3) That there is no auditable or co-ordinated review of the appropriateness of the urgency or emergency nature of the situation: - There does not appear to be any review of the urgency of the situation by control personnel, or continued assessment of the need to apply the exemptions or permissions referred to above.

4) That there is no statutory requirement for training: - There appears to be no statutory requirement for even a basic level of training before using high powered motorcycles and applying the exemptions or permissions, nor does there appear to be any requirement for ongoing or refresher training.

This, as referred to above, is not intended to criticise or demonise the exceptional work that the blood bike charities provide to our National Health Service, but rather to highlight concerns and apparent incongruities in the current legislation. Accordingly I seek clarification as to whether the legislation as it currently stands requires amendment, or a policy/protocol be created, such that Blood Bikes or similar voluntary services do fulfil the criteria to apply liveried markings and emergency lighting and sirens, and would accordingly when responding to “emergency” situations would benefit from the exemptions and/or permissions; or that they do not fulfil the criteria and accordingly should not be marked up and fitted with the emergency lights and sirens, and if already fitted, should not use them.",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,49,Male,Driver

He had been for a night out socialising in Workington. He became extremely inebriated, and in the early hours of the morning decided to walk home to Cockermouth some 9 miles east of Workington. The evidence was that he had done this on a number of occasions. He decided to walk along the A66 (Stainburn bypass) trunk road. He was struck by a motor vehicle being driven on the eastbound carriageway by an off-duty special constable. He died of the resultant injuries.

The Inquest heard from a police officer that he himself had on previous occasions picked up three pedestrians on the stretch of road where the accident occurred in very similar circumstances. He described the road as a ""fast road"" and that the lack of lighting was ""a massive factor"", and it ""needs lighting there definitely, it's so dark""

The inquest had the benefit of collision investigator's report which stated amongst other things:
1. The accident occurred on the A66 just east of the roundabout adjacent to the Workington Academy. The eastbound carriageway has two lanes at this point with a speed limit of 60 mph. The westbound has one lane. There is limited lighting from the roundabout to the national speed limit sign on the bypass.
2. Mr Bancroft was struck on the nearside of the eastbound lane at 03:36
3. The car was travelling at about 60 mph (26.82 m/s)
4. The distance the driver would have first seen Mr Bancroft was 19.45-22.45 m if the driver were not looking for, nor expecting to see a pedestrian.
5. The shortest stopping distance would be 48 m in an emergency stop.
6. There are no pedestrian facilities on this road.

There have been three pedestrian fatalities on this stretch of road, all in the early hours, in the dark and whilst the deceased has been drunk. There has also been a non-fatal collision with a pedestrian, again in the early hours.","1. There is nothing to discourage pedestrians from walking along the A66 e.g. signage

2. Cars are rapidly accelerating from the well-lit roundabout at Stainburn onto an unlit section of the A66 as the national speed limit sign is very close to the roundabout.

These investigations concluded at the end of the joint inquest on 13 February 2020.","On 16 October 2019 Lorraine Molyneaux left her place of work at Dunelm Mill on Turbary Retail Park, Ringwood Road, Bournemouth on foot. She intended to visit her friend who lived on the other side of Ringwood Road. The road is a dual carriageway with a speed limit of 40 mph. There are 2 designated pedestrian crossings along the section between Mountbatten Roundabout and Clock Garage Roundabout. Lorraine was seen to run across the southbound carriageway of Ringwood Road near to the entrance to Turbary Retail Park and was struck by a motorcycle being ridden by James Anthony Lewis. Prior to the collision James had consumed alcohol. Lorraine died at the scene and James was taken to Southampton General Hospital, Southampton where he was diagnosed with significant traumatic head injuries. His condition deteriorated, and he died on 22 October 2019.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. Although there are 2 pedestrian crossings along Ringwood Road between the Mountbatten Roundabout and the Clock Garage Roundabout, people are regularly seen to cross the road at the location where this collision occurred where there is no crossing. The crossings are approximately 210 and 375 metres from the point where the collision occurred.

ii. One of the reasons it is believed that people cross the road at this location is the proximity of the bus stops, on both sides of the road, to this point on the road which is by the entrance to Turbary Retail Park. If people travel to the Retail Park by bus, they cross at this point rather than walk the distance to the crossing. Evidence was given that people of all ages, including youngsters and older people, cross at this location.

iii. Evidence was further given that a very similar collision occurred at this location in September 2018, just under 13 months prior to this collision. That collision resulted in the death of a 74 year old pedestrian who had just got off the bus and was struck by a motorcycle whilst crossing the road at this location.

iv. Evidence was given that the risk of further deaths at this location has been raised by Dorset Police to BCP Council and BCP Council submitted an application for funding to the Department for Transport for a controlled crossing to be installed or consideration be given to changing the layout of the junction. This application was made in November 2019 and it is understood that no action has been taken since.

v. Evidence was also given by a witness at the inquest, who is a local driving instructor and drives along Ringwood Road regularly, that the lighting in this area is dull. It was explained that along this stretch there are street lights in the central reservation of the dual carriageway but not on the sides of the road. She explained that on the night in question some of the lights were not working and are still not working. Lorraine was wearing dark clothing and James was not wearing any high visibility clothing which may have affected their visibility.

I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. The deaths of Lorraine and James now bring the total fatalities to 3 in the same location and in similar circumstances since September 2018. I have concerns that there could be future deaths at this location if action is not taken.

ii. I therefore request that a review is undertaken of the pedestrian crossings and the layout of Ringwood Road outside of Turbary Retail Park. I request that consideration is given to the placing of a pedestrian crossing closer to the bus stops and the entrance to Turbary Retail Park as soon as possible to avoid future deaths.

iii. I further request that the street lighting between Mountbatten Roundabout and Clock Garage Roundabout is reviewed in relation to the amount of lighting and to ensure that the current lighting is working.",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,62,Female,Pedestrian

Connor,Berkshire,JR Calc; AACE,I conducted an inquest into the death of Aston Neil McLean that was heard by a jury at Reading Town Hall from 11-22 November 2019. The jury concluded that the timing of the decision by ambulance staff to declare Aston deceased on scene did not cause or contribute to his death.,"In the early hours of 6 August 2014, Aston was pursued by Thames Valley Police from the scene of a suspected offence. Tragically, this resulted in a collision with an armed response vehicle at 01.56 hours that morning. Aston was trapped underneath the vehicle. An ambulance technician attended at 01.59 hours. When he got to Aston, he could see his head sticking out from under the vehicle. He was not able to assess Aston’s airway. He could not see or hear any breathing. He was not able to feel a pulse on Aston’s wrist. He was not able to detect any neurological response or signs of life. He concluded that Aston was dead. Aston was declared deceased at 02.05 hours. Subsequent to this, it was agreed that there was no way to lift the heavy armed response vehicle in a safe manner. The evidence of the ambulance crew was that they did not know how long it would take for the fire service to attend, nor how long it would take them to lift the vehicle off Aston.

The ambulance crew who attended believed Aston had injuries incompatible with life. They assumed Aston had been under the vehicle for longer than he in fact had. It was thought that Aston had suffered an injury which was “unequivocally associated with death” – because of the car crushing down on him. When completing the Recognition of Life Extinct form (‘ROLE’), the crew felt that the relevant category was that of “massive similar injuries”.

Subsequent evidence from the fire service (together with reconstruction videos) indicated that the fire service was likely to have been able to lift the vehicle off Aston within 4½ minutes. They were in attendance at the scene from 02.04.

I instructed an independent expert in this case. He is an ICU consultant who has previously been the Clinical Director of an ambulance service and is also involved in reviewing JRCALC guidelines. The expert gave evidence that he too would have declared Aston deceased in the way that the attending crew did. He also however indicated that, if the vehicle had been lifted off Aston very soon after the collision, he may have survived. This aspect of his evidence is arguably contradictory, given that recognition of life extinct by an ambulance clinician can only take place where there is a condition “unequivocally associated with death”. It would appear that in this scenario both the attending crew and the expert have taken into account (correctly or otherwise) a view that the vehicle could not be lifted off Aston soon enough to change the outcome.","(1) I invite you to reconsider your guidelines in relation to ROLE, to clarify that this should only occur where death has already taken place, and not on the basis of either of the following assumptions:
(a) Likely death at some imminent point in the future; and/or
(b) Perceived difficulty in the timing of extracting a patient from a position where providing treatment is physically impossible.

In this case, the decision not to lift the vehicle was based on a declaration of death in circumstances where the ambulance crew had no knowledge of how quickly the fire service would be able to lift the vehicle off Aston. Whilst the jury found that this did not cause or contribute to Aston’s death, there is a risk of future deaths should a similar scenario occur.

(2) The need for a wider category of injuries “unequivocally associated with death” (i.e. “massive similar injuries”) makes sense, given that no list could possibly include every scenario. The current guidance makes clear that any condition in this category must be “unequivocally associated with death”. In addition, the phrase “similar massive injuries” is in the same category as “hemicorporectomy”. It may be that the inference from this is already sufficiently clear, but it may also be useful for you to consider making clear what level of injury is covered by the phrase “similar massive injuries”. There should presumably be no doubt whatsoever that death has occurred.

(3) It was clear from the evidence in this case that the crew attending did not know that the fire service had equipment which would have enabled them to lift the vehicle off Aston within a short space of time. This could clearly form an important part of key decision making at scenes like this. I invite you to consider incorporating within your guidelines the recommendation that local ambulance services should obtain relevant information from their local fire service on this point, and include this in local guidance.",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Pedestrian

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 January 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was:

Road traffic collision","Anthony Carroll was a local, well-liked Liverpool man. He was on his way home from the Throstles Nest public house at 18:40 on 25/12/2018, having celebrated Christmas Day with his family earlier that day. Anthony headed northbound on Scotland Road A59, Liverpool.

Having not used the pedestrian crossing immediately available outside the Throstles Nest, for reasons unknown, Anthony walked a short distance and crossed the carriageway, on to the central reservation, where he continued to walk along, heading northbound.

A police vehicle Peugeot 308 in the local area, was responding to an emergency call, received at 18:48. Action taken by this police officer was to action blue lights, and what he thought was sounding sirens—although sirens were not actually activated along with deploying blue lights—as well as increasing speed from 30 mph up to 63 mph to arrive at place of emergency as soon as possible, heading north up Scotland Road A59.

At that time Anthony had arrived on foot approximately 10 metres away from the second pedestrian crossing on Scotland Road, near Hopwood Street, in the central reservation. The police vehicle at this time was in lane 3, 190 metres away. Although the area was well lit here, Anthony was wearing dark clothing, carrying a red bag with him.

Anthony stopped and looked left, to check for oncoming traffic for 3 seconds, while standing on the central reservation, at which point the police vehicle was 190 metres away from him.

Anthony then steps on to the carriageway, still looking to his left, southbound, towards oncoming traffic. After being in the carriageway 1.3 seconds, Anthony was struck by the police vehicle, at 47 mph. The police officer driving the vehicle carried out an emergency stop in a split second, slightly swerving to his left in doing so, but unfortunately had already collided with Anthony.

Both police officers immediately got out of the vehicle to attend to Anthony, after radioing for paramedics. One officer attempted to resuscitate Anthony, and was assisted by an off-duty Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) who was on his way home from work. The EMT found Anthony to be unresponsive at this time.

A senior paramedic arrived on scene in 6-7 minutes, who performed CPR and advanced medical techniques on Anthony.

Anthony was put on a stretcher and taken by ambulance with blue lights on at 19:21, to the trauma centre in University Hospital Aintree, where he was pronounced dead at 19:40.

Under these prevailing circumstances, there was no opportunity for the collision to be avoided.

During the post mortem toxicology report, Anthony’s blood alcohol level was found to be 308 mg per 100 ml.","1. During the course of evidence, it was apparent that the public might be under a misapprehension that police emergency vehicles responding to an emergency are limited to 20 mph above the designated speed limit for the road. Has there been publicity that vehicles need to respond safely as quickly as possible? If not, is this under consideration?

2. During the course of evidence, the police driver and the police passenger believed the sirens were activated and sounding.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 November 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Wilcox died as a result of a traumatic head injury due to a road traffic accident.","At approximately 7.40 am on 7 March 2019, the Deceased was walking east from the White Swan pub car park West End on the south side of the A27 Mansbridge Road with a work colleague, on route to a building site at that location. The pair attempted to cross the carriageway to the northern side, to continue their east bound journey when the footpath on the southern side of the road came to an end. The traffic on the road was stationary at the time due to temporary traffic lights and the pair climbed over a low-level ARMCO barrier, dividing the footpath from the carriageway. They entered the east bound carriageway and passed in front of a stationary minibus. As the height of the vehicle prevented any line of sight for them to oncoming eastbound traffic, the evidence established that on emerging from the front of the vehicle into the eastbound carriageway, the deceased looked (left) to the westbound carriage way for opposing oncoming traffic but failed to appreciate the approach of a motorcycle overtaking the stationary traffic in the eastbound carriageway (to his right). Despite a brief effort by his colleague to prevent his forward movement, the Deceased stepped into the path of the oncoming motorcycle whereupon he was struck by the bike and spun into the opposite carriageway. He fell heavily, striking his head on the tarmac. The timescale involved amounted to no more than a second, giving no time for the rider to appreciate the imminent danger and to take avoiding action. The Deceased was conveyed to hospital, but despite significant clinical efforts to save his life, his injuries were determined too catastrophic and he died as a result of the injuries he sustained.","(1) The A27 Mansbridge Road at the stretch of carriageway from well before the White Swan pub to beyond the scene of this incident (as far as Gaters Hill) does not provide any form of (safe) pedestrian or cycle crossing or any warnings to motorists that pedestrians or cyclists may be crossing along its length.
(2) For pedestrians walking (or cyclists not on the carriageway heading) east on the southern side, the only option to travel beyond the scene of this incident is on the northern side of the A27 carriageway. As such, anyone who has not sought to cross the carriageway at a much earlier juncture is either forced to retrace their steps to find another point to cross or (as is more likely) to attempt to cross the carriageway once the pathway runs out, where it tapers and stops at the metal barriers and at its junction with the Itchen Navigation. In either event, neither pedestrians nor cyclists have a defined or safe means by which to cross the carriageway and no warnings are given to motorists that they may do so.
(3) The A27 Mansbridge Road is a busy, popular and major throughway, running east-west and south of and parallel to the M27. As such it presents an increased risk to pedestrians and cyclists alike.

This car was signalling, about to make a proper right turn onto the C229 road, when the deceased's car collided into the turning car having struck head on a second vehicle that had been approaching, being correctly driven along the opposite carriageway, the presence of which the deceased had failed to observe.

The deceased sustained multiple unsurvivable injuries and notwithstanding attempted resuscitation was pronounced dead at the scene.

Attending police officers established the deceased had not been wearing his seatbelt at the time of the impact.","i. The inquest heard from a forensic collision investigator and a local resident who was also a former highways officer who both confirmed that the location of the collision was a notorious accident ""hotspot"", in that whilst there had been no previous fatalities, there had been innumerable ""near misses"" as well as non-fatal road traffic collisions;

II","At around 18:30 hrs on 28 January 2019, the deceased was crossing an area of unlit road on the A693, around 565 metres west of the Beamish roundabout, when he was struck by a motor car being driven westbound, within the speed limit, with dipped headlights.","The section of the A693 where the collision occurred is:

• a de facto pedestrian crossing point connecting footpaths intersecting that road;
• an area to which the national speed limit applies (60mph for cars);
• very dark at night, being unaffected by ambient illumination;
• without street lighting

The material section of road is a natural crossing point for pedestrians travelling between two footpaths leading between the collision site: and (i) the village of No Place, to the south of the A693 and (ii) the village of Kip Hill, to the north of the A693.

I accepted the following evidence about the material section of road (given by a police Collision Investigator): (i) the road is approximately 12m wide, and after nightfall is “in complete darkness”, being bordered by dense trees and unaffected by discernible ambient light; (ii) drivers are entirely reliant on headlamp illumination to detect pedestrians; (iii) in reliance on his own dipped headlamps, a driver could gain first sight of a static pedestrian in the carriageway at a distance of no more than 40m from that pedestrian; and (iv) a motor car travelling at 60mph would require significantly more than 40m (around 80m) to come to a halt (taking into account driver reaction time and mechanical stopping distance).

In this case, the driver first saw the deceased “just prior to the collision” when the latter was running “with large strides” towards the southern side of the A693.

Hunt,Birmingham and Solihull,[REDACTED] – Lorry driver; S & J Transport – Employer of lorry driver; Scania – Lorry manufacturer; Road Haulage Association; Department of Transport,On 17/10/2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Suzanna Jayne Bull. The investigation was adjourned under S11 and Schedule 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 pending the outcome of a criminal trial.,"The circumstances of the collision are that Dr Bull was riding her pedal cycle along the Pershore Road in the direction of Birmingham City Centre, she was using the designated bus/cycle lane. Dr Bull was passed by [REDACTED] who was driving a 32 tonne lorry at a point adjacent to West Midlands Police Training Centre Tally Ho, the lorry then had to slow and stop at the junction with Priory Road for a red traffic light.

Dr Bull approached the stationary traffic and proceeded towards the advanced stop line using the dedicated cycle lane, she advanced along the nearside of the lorry. The traffic lights turned to green and traffic started to proceed, Dr Bull was ahead of the lorry by a maximum of three bike lengths before the lorry started to catch her up. The lorry then began a left turn manoeuvre and struck Dr Bull dragging her under the front of his vehicle. Dr Bull died as a result of the offside second steered wheel passing over her prone body and trapping her beneath.

Evidence in the criminal proceedings centred on an aftermarket dashboard tray which the lorry driver had placed on his dashboard which he then adorned with personal items including a satellite navigation device, an electric fan, ornaments and toys which then obscured his view to the front and nearside. See photo attached.

When this table was fitted it created a huge blind spot and had the tray not been placed on the dashboard, Dr Bull would have been seen for at least 5 seconds. With the tray in place it is probable that she could not be seen by the lorry driver.

Evidence was given in the criminal trial by DVSA and Scania Tamworth that the fitting of the aftermarket tray was deemed to be dangerous and with the table fitted the vehicle would undoubtedly have failed the MOT.

There are no manufacturer details known about the table fitted to the lorry as it was taken from the storeroom at his employer’s location and placed into his own vehicle, he was aware that the previous owner had purchased it from the internet to use in a Scania lorry but had since changed vehicles. The tray/table is not a standard fit item supplied by Scania.

The Scania group do sell accessories for the vehicles they sell and some newer vehicles are now supplied with standard fit tray/tables however these are either hinged to fold away or are completely detachable and are not designed to be used when the vehicle is in motion.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:
1a) MULTIPLE INJURIES
1b) ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENT","1. The fact that the tray creates a blind spot may not be apparent to users. There is no warning on the tray to say that it can create a blind spot when fixed in place whilst the vehicle is moving.

Bennett,Birmingham and Solihull,Highways England,On 24/08/2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jamil Ahmed. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 22 January 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was road traffic collision.,"On the morning of 18 August 2017 the M6 motorway section passing through the northerly outskirts of Birmingham City Centre was congested and the automated ‘smart’ motorway system permitted vehicles to use the hard shoulder as a temporary running lane. There were intermittent Emergency Refuge Areas. Mr Ahmed was travelling in his low-loader lorry along the hard shoulder on the southbound section between junctions 6 and 5 which are 1.6 miles apart. To the nearside of this section of the hard shoulder was a barrier and significant drop. At around 09.13hrs his vehicle came to a stop. The nearest Emergency Refuge Area was 300 metres further forward. Mr Ahmed activated his hazard lights, exited his lorry, opened the bonnet and stood looking into the engine. The maximum speed limit was 60mph and 135 seconds after stopping, a lorry travelling at 55mph, drove into the rear of Mr Ahmed’s lorry causing him fatal injuries. This preceded a number of approaching vehicles, including large lorries, narrowly avoided a similar collision by veering into lane 1, which was busy with other vehicles. A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of death was multiple injuries from blunt force trauma. Toxicology revealed he has recently consumed cannabis.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern when a hard shoulder is used as a running lane.

Whilst any vehicle may break down on any road, in relation to motorways: (1) drivers do not expect to come across a stationary vehicle in a running lane, (2) the speed of traffic is high, (3) the volume of traffic is high increasing the number of people affected by a stationary vehicle, (4) the options for the occupants of a stationary vehicle to escape the road are more limited, and (5) not all stretches of motorway are necessarily appropriate for use as ‘smart’ motorways; for example, the stretch of motorway in question was raised with a significant drop next to the hard shoulder, as opposed to a stretch of hard shoulder adjacent to a bank or field.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 November 2019. The conclusion of the inquest into the death was:

Road Traffic Collision","At about 06:45 on 9 November 2018 Mr McGivern was cycling to work along Dover Road, Slough Trading Estate. He was riding in a northerly direction along Dover Road, when his bicycle came into collision with a heavy goods vehicle, which turned left from Dover Road into Buckingham Avenue at a traffic light-controlled junction.

A post-mortem revealed the cause of death to be 1(a) multiple injuries.","I am concerned that there have now been two collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles at the junction of Dover Road and Buckingham Avenue caused by motor vehicles turning left at the traffic lights, and colliding with cyclists crossing the junction.

There are many commercial vehicles using the roads around Slough Trading Estate, but also cyclists and pedestrians.

The cycle lanes as they are marked on Dover Road may encourage cyclists to ride up the inside of vehicles waiting to turn left at the traffic lights, and they may not be seen by the drivers of those vehicles as they pull away from the lights and turn left, especially during the hours of darkness

The sharing of the carriageway of Dover Road between bicycles and motor vehicles by means of cycle lanes may put cyclists at risk.

A review of the road layout of Dover Road, including the question of whether there should be dedicated marked cycle lanes, and if so, whether these should be positioned in the carriageway or on the pavement (so that the carriageway is reserved for motor vehicles and the pavement is shared between cyclists and pedestrians, with dedicated cycle paths) may produce a road system which is safer for cyclists.

In considering Jamie’s movements on the night he died, the inquest determined that Jamie’s mistake had been caused by a combination of not knowing the area and being under the influence of alcohol, however access generally to the A40 in the area was considered. Police Constable 217 [REDACTED] gave evidence to the inquest and presented the findings of the Collision Investigation Report. He indicated that there is relatively easy access onto the A40 in this area and was surprised that there were no signs which could alert pedestrians to the A40, or to prevent them from entering onto the slip road.

Although lack of signage did not contribute to Jamie’s death I consider that this is a matter for consideration in preventing pedestrians from straying inadvertently onto this busy road in future.

Sigee,Cheshire,"The Chief Executive Officer, Highways England","On 9 April 2019 the Senior Coroner for Cheshire commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Costel Daniel Stancu, aged 37 years.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 October 2019 when I determined that:

1. the medical cause of Mr Stancu’s death was 1(a) hypoxic encephalopathy, 1(b) asystolic cardiac arrest, 1(c) traumatic brain injury; and

2. these injuries were sustained in a series of road traffic collisions in which Mr Stancu was involved on 29 March 2019.","Mr Costel Daniel Stancu died at the Royal Stoke University Hospital on 3 April 2019, aged 37 years; Mr Stancu had been admitted to hospital on an emergency basis following a number of road traffic collisions which occurred shortly after 02:00 am on 29 March 2019 and he died despite intensive medical care from the injuries sustained in this incident.

Mr Stancu had driven his car from Liverpool at approximately 01:00 am on 29 March 2019, intending to drive to London.

A sample of blood serum taken from Mr Stancu at 03:47 am on 29 March 2019 revealed that at that time his blood alcohol concentration was more than 2½ times the legal drink driving limit within England & Wales; the alcohol that Mr Stancu had consumed prior to his journey significantly impaired his observation, driving and reaction to other road users.

Mr Stancu was driving at excessive speed and without adequate care or consideration for himself or other road users.

Mr Stancu drove his car along the M6 between junctions 18 and 19 in a southbound direction. This section of motorway had recently been changed from 3 traffic lanes plus a hard shoulder in each direction to a new ‘smart motorway’ with 4 lanes for vehicles to travel in each direction and occasional refuges to enable vehicles to come to a stop away from the moving traffic lanes. There was no refuge on this immediate section of the motorway. At this time there was only moderate traffic upon the motorway, it was pitch black, there was no residual lighting from the surrounding area and this section of motorway was unlit.

Mr Stancu drove his vehicle into collision with the rear of a van which was properly proceeding in lane 3 with its rear lights illuminated in front of Mr Stancu. This caused a series of collisions between Mr Stancu’s car, the van and a lorry which had been properly proceeding in lane 1 (“the First Series of Collisions”).

Following the First Series of Collisions, the lorry came to stop in lane 1 with its hazard lights illuminated, the van came to rest in lane 4 adjacent to the central reservation with a rear hazard light illuminated and Mr Stancu’s car came to rest a short distance beyond the van in lane 4. Mr Stancu’s car was dark blue in colour, it was upside down, sideways on to the oncoming traffic and all its lights were turned off; it was not visible to other road users until the headlights from their vehicle illuminated it.

Other vehicles continued to pass these stationary vehicles with various of them narrowly avoiding a collision at high speed.

Approximately 4 minutes 10 seconds after the First Series of Collisions there was a further series of impacts between vehicles which were still travelling south along this section of the motorway and the stationary vehicles (“the Second Series of Collisions”).

The drivers of the other vehicles involved in the Second Series of Collisions had no adequate opportunity to see and avoid colliding with the stationary cars which were partially obstructing the motorway.

Following the Second Series of Collisions the motorway was blocked by traffic, warning signs were activated to warn approaching vehicles of the incident ahead and the emergency services were able to attend and respond to the incident.

There had been no warnings given to approaching vehicles of the incident prior to the Second Series of Collisions.","I determined that the lack of lighting on this section of the motorway was a contributory factor to the second series of collisions; the evidence at inquest was that this section of the motorway remains unlit at night and I am concerned that this creates an ongoing risk to life.

Whilst I found that none of the collisions were caused by the conversion of this section of the motorway to a ‘smart motorway’ I am concerned that this change in layout may have increased the risks posed to users of the motorway including the risk arising from the lack of lighting.

The evidence that I heard during the inquest suggested that the risk arising from the lack of lighting had not been re-assessed either as part of the conversion to a ‘smart motorway’ or following the incident on 29 March 2019.",False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,37,Male,Driver

Connor,Berkshire,Ford UK; Highways England,"On 15th November 2018 I commenced an investigation into the deaths of Catherine Gardiner, Jason Aleixo and Lorraine McLellan. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10th October 2019.

I recorded a conclusion of Road Traffic Collision for each of the three deceased.

I also recorded:

[Each of the deceased] died after the vehicle which [s/he] was travelling was in collision with another vehicle. The reason why the vehicle in which [Ms Gardiner] was travelling came to an abrupt stop remains unclear after detailed investigation, although on balance a problem with the vehicle appears to be more likely than driver input from the minibus driver.","The lives of Catherine Gardiner, Jason Aleixo and Lorraine McLellan were lost when the minibus (which Ms Gardiner was driving) was hit from behind by an LGV, on 11th October 2018. Mr Aleixo and Ms McLellan died at the scene. Ms Gardiner died the following day at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Others in the vehicle suffered life-changing injuries.

The circumstances of the collision were explored in detail at the inquest. I have issued a separate Regulation 28 Report addressed to Ford with regard to issues raised in that respect. Despite detailed investigation, we were unable to ascertain a reason why the minibus, which had been travelling perfectly normally along the M4 (between Junctions 14 and 13), came to an abrupt holt. We were able to rule out a number of possible driver input issues, as well as vehicle issues. None of these could explain what happened in this case.

I have not set out the detail of the evidence we heard. We also viewed dashcam footage which showed the collision. I found no concern in relation to the driving of the other vehicle involved in the collision. The reasons for this were clear from the dashcam footage in particular.

We heard evidence during the inquest from [redacted] Traffic Management witness, and [redacted] from Highways England regarding the temporary closure of the hard shoulder on this part of the M4. Tragically, we heard that this temporary barrier was installed the day before this incident.

I found it unlikely that a hard shoulder would have assisted the driver of the LGV which was in collision of the rear of the minibus. There would not have been enough time for his vehicle to move into the hard shoulder, and the evidence suggested that his wheels locked when he carried out emergency braking. Crucially however, it may have offered the minibus the opportunity to move out of harm’s way before the vehicle was struck from behind.

We heard in evidence that an order was put in place allowing the hard shoulder to be closed for barriers to be replaced. This was on M4 Motorway (Junctions 13-16) (Temporary Prohibition of Traffic) Order 2018. We heard that Varioguard barriers were put in place on the 10th October 2018, and removed on the 9th November 2018. The work to replace the barriers was carried out, during the night, in between those two dates.

I did not express concerns during the inquest about the amount of time the work took. I did not question the need for temporary closures of hard shoulders in these scenarios. What did concern me was the wording of the Order obtained (referred to above). This provided for a start date (in this case 24th September 2018), but no end date. The Order simply states that the closure may continue “until completion of the works.”

I called a witness from Highway England to attend the inquest, given the issues which had arisen the previous day. It would appear, from the evidence we heard, that there is no statutory framework for any government organisation (including Highways England) to ensure that the works are completed without delay. We heard evidence of delay caused by weather conditions, contractor and sub-contractor issues, and supply chains. It would appear that the only incentive to proceeding without delay relates to commercial pressures — for the contractor and possibly sub-contractors.

I heard no evidence that any organisation is charged with ensuring that the risk of closing a hard shoulder is kept to the shortest time possible.

3103,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/dev-naran/,2019-0341,2019-10-14,E. Brown,Birmingham and Solihull,Highways England,On 1 June 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dev Dilesh Naran. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 11 October 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision.,"Dev Dilesh Naran was 8 years old when he sustained an unsurvivable head injury whilst a rear seat passenger in a Toyota Yaris that was struck by a Mercedes-Benz large goods vehicle on the nearside lane of the southbound carriageway of the M6 motorway between junctions 6 and 5. The Toyota Yaris had stopped in the nearside lane which was a hard shoulder operating as a live lane under the Managed Motorway Network scheme. The lane was clearly marked as a live running lane and vehicles were obviously using it as such as the Toyota Yaris travelled towards the scene. It is not known why the Toyota Yaris stopped but there is no evidence of a fault with the vehicle causing it to stop, illness of the driver or a hazard in the road. The goods vehicle had been travelling in the nearside lane for 650 metres but due to the geography of the road and other traffic on the road had only a very short time to identify that the Toyota Yaris was stationary and react. During this time the driver was checking his offside mirror but when he saw the vehicle he reacted by braking and steering into the adjacent lane 1 second before the collision but hit the rear of the Toyota Yaris with its front nearside.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a) Head injury
1b) Road traffic collision","1. Vehicles stopping in live lanes of a motorway create a risk to life due to the speed of the traffic approaching, the difficulty approaching drivers will have in identifying that a vehicle in the lane ahead of them is stationary and the fact that the volume of traffic around any stopped vehicle can inhibit the ability of a driver to take evasive action without coming into contact with other road users.
2. Those managing the motorway network have no system of automatic alert to a stopped lone vehicle in a live lane and rely on the MIDAS system picking up slow moving traffic, 999 calls and calls from the general public. It is not known how frequently vehicles are stopping on the hard shoulder of the M6 because if there are no calls and no traffic build up the control centre may not become aware. Furthermore, when operators do become aware of a stationary vehicle, they do not routinely look back at how long the vehicle had been stationary before the control room was alerted therefore it is not known on average how long it takes the control room to become aware of a stopped vehicle.
3. When compared to motorways not operating a dynamic hard shoulder running scheme there is a greater risk that vehicles will stop on the hard shoulder/lane 1 of the M6 in the vicinity of junctions 6 and 5 when the hard shoulder is a live lane and that there will be a greater danger when doing so because:
a) there is a 2.5 mile gap in the emergency refuge areas at this point;
b) this section of the M6 is elevated and as such there is no land along the edge of the motorway to which occupants of vehicles forced to stop on the hard shoulder can retreat;
c) the carriageway to the nearside of the hard shoulder/lane 1 is only 0.4m wide before there is a low raised kerb with a paved area of 1.4m wide bordered by a 0.7m tall retaining wall at the edge of the flyover therefore vehicles are restricted in their ability to pull fully out of the live lane;
d) although the signage that the hard shoulder is in use as a live lane in this area accords with the Highway Code and the Managed Motorway Network Scheme there is a real risk that drivers seeing a hard shoulder bordered by solid white lines (and who may have used the road when the hard shoulder is not in use as a live lane) may become confused and forget/fail to register that the hard shoulder is operating as a live lane.
4. The Highways Agency is introducing a radar system to identify lone stationary vehicles on all lane running schemes which will operate in low flow. This technology does not operate in moderate to high flow density and is not intended for use on dynamic hard shoulder running schemes where the hard shoulder would not be in use in low flow traffic.
5. Mr. Maxwell Brown, Head of Road Design, Safety, Engineering and Standards, at Highways England gave evidence that a colleague is undertaking research into technology that could be used to identify lone stationary vehicles in higher traffic flows. Mr. Brown did not know what technologies were being considered nor what the time scale for this project is. Mr. Brown’s evidence was that this is not being looked at with dynamic hard shoulder running schemes in mind nor for the M6 specifically as it is not regarded as an acute problem.
6. The effect of this evidence is to cause me concern that the particular nature of the risk on this section of the M6 arising from the matters set out at para 3 above is not regarded as an acute problem by the Highways Agency when it should be and that I was not given evidence of specific work being undertaken to address this particular risk.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,8,Male,Other

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 October 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was that ‘Saeid Hedayat lost control of the vehicle he was driving on the B2112 which overturned. As a result of this he suffered a hypoxic brain injury and died’.",On 8 February 2019 Saeid was involved in a single vehicle road traffic collision. Following heavy rain the B2112 was flooded across the westbound carriageway. This flooding resulted from the blockage of drain number B9913 with debris and silt. The blockage occurred on top of the drain grating in zone 1. Nothing in the other zones of the drain impeded the drainage of water. When the police collision investigator attended the scene 2 hours and 50 minutes after the collision the water was receding but still measured up to 7 cm in depth. I found that the depth of the flood at the time of the incident was likely to be greater than this. There is no lighting at the location and the road is subject to the national speed limit. No conclusions could be drawn from the evidence available about the speed at which Saeid was driving. Saeid either lost control after swerving to avoid the floodwaters or as a result of aquaplaning having hit the floodwaters. After losing control his vehicle flipped and landed on its roof causing multiple injuries.,"(1) West Sussex County Council’s risk assessment which was carried out to determine drain clearance frequency did not take any account of zone 1 blockages and I heard evidence that there is no time period set for reviewing the risk assessments. I heard evidence that the risk levels have not been reviewed since 2011 despite more recent data being available.

(2) I also heard evidence that neither anomalous silt level reports nor reports from members of the public of road flooding would trigger a review of the risk assessments.

(3) The highways authority representative at the inquest was not able to inform me of what plans West Sussex County Council has to reassess the drain risk levels in light of the increased severity of winter storms.

(4) I found that drain numbered B9913 was blocked on a regular basis due to debris and silt collecting in zone 1. There are no warning signs (temporary or permanent) drawing drivers’ attention to the flood risk despite this. I heard evidence that signs would not normally be installed unless the highways authority were not able to immediately resolve the flooding if they attended.

The conclusion of the inquest was that ‘Richard Lester Ridout died as a result of Influenza A and streptococcal pneumonia causing sepsis which led to multiple organ failure.’","On 20 January 2019 Richard Ridout was involved in a single vehicle road traffic collision. His vehicle left the road and rolled over. Richard Ridout extricated himself from the vehicle after paramedics arrived. He was complaining of a pain in his shoulder and did not report any additional pain upon c-spine palpation. He reported that he had consumed 40mg diazepam and 8mg Buprenorphine. He stated to the ambulance staff that he had been travelling at 30 mph. On arrival at St Richard’s Hospital he was diagnosed with a fractured scapula. He complained of both neck and shoulder pain. A chest and pelvic x-ray were ordered but Richard declined the latter. He declined a full trauma examination. No additional pain was reported on c-spine palpation. He informed the junior doctor that he had been travelling at 50-60mph. His c-spine was not imaged, a trauma series CT was not requested and a trauma call was not put out. On 29 January 2019 Richard was readmitted to hospital and transferred to St Guy’s & Thomas’ due to respiratory failure. Fractures of his C7 and C5 vertebrae were discovered along with pulmonary contusions. He was in septic shock and contracted the infections noted above.

These included where a high speed was involved in an RTC. In this inquest it was clear that inconsistent information was given about the speed and the junior doctor was informed that the speed was 50-60 mph. Despite this inconsistency and evidence of a high speed collision no trauma call was put out.

(2) I heard evidence that no trauma series CT scan was carried out or trauma call put out despite Richard suffering an injury requiring a high degree of force (fractured scapula) and having been involved in a roll-over RTC.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 September 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was death was attributable to a road traffic collision in which Dr Ball sustained 1(a) multiple skull fractures and 1(b) traumatic head injury following a motor vehicle collision.","On the evening of Saturday 24 November 2018 a DAF HGV lost power and came to a halt around 18:15 hours on the A647 Stanningley bypass near Pudsey, Leeds. This is a two lane dual carriageway subject to a 70 mph speed limit. It was stationary in lane 1 for 41 minutes displaying hazard warning lights and amber cab beacons alongside the nearside crash barriers awaiting mechanical assistance. Dr Ball was driving a Skoda motorcar and collided with the rear of the 32 ton stationary DAF HGV at a speed estimated to be between 50-60 mph. Despite wearing a seat belt and the deployment of the air bag he sustained fatal injuries and was declared dead at the scene at 19:18.","(1) The HGV was not equipped with a device (such as a warning triangle) which the driver could have positioned some way before his stranded vehicle to warn oncoming motorists of the hazard presented by a stranded 32 ton HGV blocking one lane of a dual carriageway in darkness.

(2) The HGV driver had not been trained or instructed to contact the emergency services to report the foreseeable hazard created by his stranded HGV on a dual carriageway at night. The HGV was there for some 41 minutes before the fatal collision occurred (although the Inquest heard evidence there were several near misses before then). It was likely that when a mechanic did arrive at the scene the HGV would have been there for a further period before it was repaired or could have been towed to a safe location. In consequence, the police had no opportunity to guard the scene, position safety barrier or warning signs to alert approaching motorists of the hazard.

(3) The evidence of the other motorists on the A647 at the material time indicated that the rear offside hazard warning light was hard to see (or thought not to be working) thus giving the impression that the HGV was indicating to turn left (and thereby potentially confusing approaching motorists). In such circumstances there was no added resilience to the lights displayed, such as would have been provided by having duplicate indicator/hazard lights on the rear corners of the HGV. Given the arduous work of such vehicles and the propensity for the light to become dirty at the end of a working day, concern was expressed at the Inquest as to the danger which might be created in the event (a) the HGV broke down in a hazardous location and (b) the rear lights were not working or insufficiently conspicuous.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,46,Male,Driver

He ran away from the member of staff who caught up with him however he stated he wished to leave but would return at 20.00. Mental Health notified WMP that he was absent but no log was created. At 15.09 the deceased mother rang to report him missing and officers were dispatched to investigate. There was confusion around whether he was in fact missing. At 21.07 he was found safe and well at his father’s home where he remained overnight. On 16/11/18 he remained at his father house leaving and returning several times.

Harrold,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove","Nathan Elvery, Chief Executive, West Sussex County Council; County Road Safety Group Manager, West Sussex County Council","On 13 November 2018, the Senior Coroner, Penelope Schofield, commenced an investigation into the death of Keith Winston Battman aged 74 years old.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 June 2019.

I recorded a conclusion of Road Traffic Collision.

The medical cause of death was recorded as:

1a) Multiple traumatic injuries and clostridium difficile colitis (treated with colectomy October 2018)

2) Cardiomegaly","At around 16:30 hours on Wednesday 10 October 2018, a Peugeot Boxer minibus was being driven north along the A285, returning from a university football match in Chichester to Uxbridge. In the front passenger seat of the minibus one of the team was assisting the driver with navigation.

At the same time, Keith Battman was travelling south on the A285 riding a Triumph Tiger motorcycle. A witness travelling in the same direction as Mr Battman told police that she had been held temporarily by traffic lights which had been placed at roadworks on the approach to the village of Duncton at its northern end. Whilst at the traffic lights she became aware of Mr Battman's motorcycle which travelled to the front of the queue and stopped. When the lights turned green she described the motorcycle as having 'shot off'.

Meanwhile, on approach to the right hand bend in front of Seaford College, the driver of the minibus had slowed, ready for the bend. As he was coming out of the bend he was confronted by Mr Battman's motorcycle travelling towards him in a straight line and on his side of the road. This is corroborated by the front seat passenger of the minibus; bike tyre markings found on the road; and one tyre mark from the minibus. Tyre markings left by the motorcycle suggest that Mr Battman was travelling in a straight line and that he may have mistook the drive leading to the school as the A285. As the minibus and Mr Battman travelled towards the bend neither road user would have been able to see each other approaching due to a high hedge that blocked the view of any approaching traffic.

Whilst approaching the left hand bend Mr Battman passed:

• A 30 mph speed sign;
• A red triangle warning sign showing a left hand bend & instruction to slow
• Two painted SLOW signs on the road surface;
• A white map type direction sign showing the direction of the main road to the left and a No Through Road straight ahead.

The colour of the road surface also changes on The Drive. However, the main road dips immediately in front of the entrance to the college and that cannot be seen until very close to the bend.

The motorcycle was upright when it collided with the front offside wing of the minibus and the front wheel of the motorcycle pushed the front offside wheel of the minibus back into the wheel arch. As the motorcycle continued forward into the front of the minibus, Mr Battman, was thrown forward and his head impacted on the lower offside corner of the windscreen. His visor detached from his helmet and there were scratches to the helmet consistent with catching the wing of the minibus.

The driver of the minibus confirmed that he saw the rider hit the window before he fell to the side of the minibus. The motorcycle then rotated clockwise before falling onto its offside. The motorcycle then slid back north along the southbound lane.

The motorcycle was reported to have caught fire almost immediately after the collision. The damage to the motorcycle was such that there may have been a fuel leak from the tank or engine and almost certainly igniting having come into contact with hot components.

On the day of the collision it was a bright sunny day, the sun would have been directly ahead of Keith Battman as he approached the bend. It is possible that glare from the sun may have obscured the view he had of the bend. However, the witness behind Mr Battman made no mention of the sun although it is not clear if she was asked.

Mr Battman received serious injuries as a result of the collision and he was airlifted to St George's Hospital in Tooting where he remained until his death on 28 October 2018.","1. I am concerned that the number of black and white chevrons installed immediately outside of the entrance to Seaford College are insufficient. There are now two small raised chevrons to allow for the dip in the road but they do not appear to adequately draw the attention of drivers approaching the bend to the fact that there is a sharp hand bend ahead. Consideration must be given to how many are needed and their location taking into account the topography and sight lines.

2. There is a speed limit sign approximately 350 metres back from the bend as you travel south. I am concerned this does not in itself give sufficient warning and perhaps a vehicle activated flashing warning sign should be installed to detect the speed of approaching traffic and alert drivers to slow down.

3. There are two “Slow” markings on the road but I am concerned that these are faded and may not be sufficiently prominent.

Serrano,Derby and Derbyshire,Derbyshire County Council; Chief Coroner,"On 25 September 2018, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Thomas Andrew Reid. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 June 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was a short narrative conclusion of: Road Traffic Collision.

The cause of death was:

1a Traumatic brain injury;
1b Skull fracture; and
1c Road traffic collision","i) Mr Reid was a 27 year old gentleman who was driving his motorbike along the A515 near to Sudbury in Ashbourne, with the junction of the B5033 (Cockshead Lane). During this journey he came across a queue of traffic. Mr Reid started to overtake the queue of traffic and had a road traffic collision with a tractor being driven by another. The tractor was in the process of completing the manoeuvre of turning right into the B5033.

ii) He sadly died from the injuries, at the roadside on the 21 September 2018.

iii) It would appear that Mr Reid did not see the route marker board 155 metres from the junction which is the only advanced warning of the junction ahead. The location and scale of the sign mean that it could be obscured by passing large vehicles, such as LGVs, especially if they are slow moving.

iv) Also that the A515 has recently been resurfaced, with central white lines and marginal white lines also having been renewed. The B5033 had not had any surface dressing applied and the white lines defining the mouth of the junction had not been renewed. The existing markings that remained were excessively worn and very faint, which made it less easy for motorists to define the mouth of the junction when travelling along the A515.","1. Evidence emerged during the inquest that there were at least two previous incidents along that part of the road. One causing fatal injuries and one causing critical injuries. Additionally, numerous other minor incidents.

2. The route marker board 155 metres from the junction is the only advanced warning of the junction ahead. The location and scale of the sign mean that it could be obscured by passing large vehicles, such as LGVs, especially if they are slow moving. This happens often given the presence of the junction.

3. Evidence also emerged at the inquest that Derbyshire County Council was aware of the issue and were looking at more signage, larger signs and additional pre-warning signs.

The investigation concluded on 16 May 2019 and the conclusion of the jury was one of;

Narrative: Sophie died as a result of being struck by a car driven by an uninsured, unlicensed person, whilst he was performing a dangerous manoeuvre at an illegal car cruising event on a public highway where a Public Spaces Protection Order was in place.","Sophie died as a result of a traumatic brain injury sustained during a high impact collision with a car whilst attending a car cruising event on 31 May 2018 at Europa Circle in Trafford Park. Car cruising events are illegal gatherings of car enthusiasts where people discuss cars, meet friends and in some cases carry out dangerous driving manoeuvres including speeding, racing and drifting. Drifting is inducing a deliberate loss of control.

It was during one such manoeuvre that Sophie was struck. The driver was unlicensed and uninsured.

Sophie subsequently died in Salford Royal Hospital on 1 June 2018 as a result of a catastrophic injury.

The contributing circumstances were that, although individuals representing Greater Manchester Police and the local authority acted with good intentions to tackle car cruising, the joint partnership approach did not work.

Even though car cruising had been identified as an issue as early as 2014 in the area, the measures and plans in place to tackle it were ineffective at the time of Sophie's death.

In addition, limited resources, complex logistics, bureaucracy and poor communication all contributed to an ineffective and slow response to preventing the circumstances surrounding Sophie's death.","The inquest heard that car cruising had been an issue in Trafford Park for a number of years. The problem (and inherent risk to public safety) was one that both the Local Authority (Trafford MBC) and GMP were aware of. Attempts to tackle it had been ineffective. Car cruising involved highly dangerous manoeuvres being carried out on public roads whilst members of the public were using the roads in significant numbers. The inquest saw video footage that showed the events leading up to the death of Sophie. It was clear that an incident involving disastrous loss of control could have happened at any time that night whilst car cruising was taking place. In addition, the inquest heard that whilst on this occasion Sophie was the sole fatality it could easily have been the case that multiple lives were lost in the incident.

One measure taken involved an application for a Public Spaces Protection Order. This had been a joint initiative but the implementation of enforcement meant that it was not effective.

The inquest heard that to tackle car cruising successfully, an effective multi-agency adequately funded and targeted approach was required. In addition the inquest heard that in an area such as Greater Manchester with multiple Local Authorities and dense population, a pan Greater Manchester approach would be required to prevent not just further incidents in Trafford Park but across Greater Manchester and nationally.

Ia Severe Head Injury

i. There are no road markings in the Poundbury estate to indicate which vehicle has the right of way when reaching a junction. In addition, parking appears to be permitted along the length of Lower Blakemere Road, which forces vehicles travelling in a northerly direction into the oncoming carriageway. Police evidence indicated that this reduced the sightline of the driver of the Iveco van when looking into Harewood Road to look for oncoming traffic.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. The lack of parking restrictions on Lower Blakemere Road result in the drivers that use that road having reduced sightlines when approaching junctions.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 May 2019.",On 19 December 2017 at approximately 8.30am Mr Phillips was riding his motorcycle along the B3091 in a north easterly direction from Sturminster Newton to Shaftesbury. He had passed Guys Marsh and was approaching the area locally known as St James' Common. The weather conditions were cold and icy. A car was approaching from the opposite direction along the single carriageway. The direction of travel of the car involved a descent. The vehicle has moved into the opposite carriageway and struck Mr Phillips broadside knocking him from his motorcycle with force. Mr Phillips was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.,"1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

a) There was water running down the descent which had frozen over.

b) The direction of travel of the running water was down the nearside of the south westerly side of the B3091, across both sides of the carriageway then down the nearside of the north easterly side of the carriageway.

c) Drivers of motor vehicles who use this route regularly reported the existence of standing/hanging water in this area being present for months prior to the accident. Those who attended the scene reported finding it difficult to remain upright when walking over the frozen stretch of road.

d) Dorset Police provided a Collision Investigation Report which concluded that the driver of the motor car lost control of the car due to the presence of the ice on the road surface. Mr Phillips was positioned correctly in the road; was driving in a manner appropriate for the road conditions; was wearing a helmet and appropriate clothing. There were no mechanical defects to either vehicle.

e) Dorset Police reported that there had been 2 road traffic collisions reported at this location in January 2015 (i.e. a similar time of the year to this incident)

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

a) The collision investigation officer from Dorset Police expressed concern in relation to the poor drainage of surface water on this particular stretch of road. My attention was drawn to four drainage gullies within 150 metres of the scene, two on each side of the road. As the water flows down the southbound side of the road it does not flow into the gulley but due to the camber of the road the water crosses over the centre of the road and flows down the centre of the road before flowing on to the opposite carriageway. On the nearside of the opposite carriageway is another drainage gulley which contains a gridded metal drain which was (at the time) largely obscured and overgrown by grass. The water once again bypasses this gulley. It is this surface water which has frozen at the time of the accident. At least 2 of the gullies which could drain the water away from the carriageway appear redundant. The positioning of these gullies are questionable.

b) Maintenance of the road and its verges.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,35,Male,Other

Moore,Cheshire,Cheshire West and Chester Council - Highways Department,"On 11 October 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of William John Hignett, aged 66. The investigation has not yet concluded and an inquest has not yet been heard, having been adjourned pending the outcome of criminal proceedings.","On 3 October 2017 Mr Hignett was riding a motorcycle on the A556 Chester Road, Sandiway. He came into collision with a HGV. He sustained fatal injuries in the collision. The driver of the HGV was subsequently prosecuted but was acquitted.

The trial judge made comments about the location of the collision. These comments have been passed on to me by the Crown Prosecution Service and I consider it appropriate for me to bring them to your attention:

The A556 at this location is a dual carriageway with a defined central reservation. The road is unlit and is subject to the national speed limit of 70 mph for a car/motorcycle. The collision occurred during the hours of darkness.

The circumstances of the collision were that the HGV had initially been travelling along the westbound carriageway of the A556 (towards Chester). Having passed beneath the overbridge of the A559 Chester Road the driver of the HGV attempted to perform a U-turn in order to head back along the A556, this time in the general direction of Manchester.

The A556 at this point has an unusual junction configuration consisting of a filter lane and break in the central median to the offside of the eastbound carriageway, specifically designed for the sole purpose of performing U-turns.

The driver of the HGV entered this filter lane and began to perform his U-turn as planned. Having committed to the turn, he moved out of the filter lane and began to enter the eastbound (Manchester bound) carriageway. His vehicle was too long and the turning circle inadequate to enable him to turn his HGV in one fluid manoeuvre. It was therefore necessary for him to 'shunt' his HGV backwards and then forwards again to complete the turn.

This U-turn placed him in the Manchester bound carriageway of the A556 for a period of around 11 seconds, with traffic legitimately approaching at 70 mph. For much of that time the nearside of the HGV was presented to oncoming traffic.

In that period of time Mr Hignett's motorcycle travelling along the Manchester bound carriageway, and being ridden properly, collided with the near side of the HGV causing fatal injuries to Mr Hignett.

The nearside of the HGV was illuminated to the by three orange 'marker lights'. Whilst fully compliant with law, in turning where it did, and with the illumination on the side of the HGV, the combination of the turn and the dark national speed limit road are relevant factors.","1.

I recorded a conclusion of road traffic conclusion.,"June was involved in a road traffic collision on 2 May 2018. She was the passenger in a Kia Venga driven by her husband. His vehicle was in collision with a Ford Galaxy people carrier driven by a taxi driver. The Kia was being driven south on the B470 High Street, Langley, approaching a traffic light controlled junction with the A4 London Road. The Kia was in a left turn only lane at the junction, but drove straight ahead into the junction, colliding with the Ford Galaxy, which was continuing on the A4 across the junction towards Slough town centre.

The evidence was clear that there was little that the taxi driver could have done to avoid this collision. Evidence from dashcam footage and from all of the key witnesses involved was consistent.

The Crown Prosecution Service did not prosecute in this case, given the tragic outcome. It is appropriate to be clear from the outset that driver error has undoubtedly played a part in this collision. I have considered whether there were mitigating factors which make further incidents at this junction likely, with the risk of future deaths occurring.

I concluded at the inquest that speed, weather conditions and the condition of the two vehicles involved played no part in this incident.","I consider that Slough Borough Council should take action to address the injury collision rate at this junction.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest 15 October 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased Christopher Innes died as a result of a road traffic collision.,"On 25 May 2018 the deceased, Christopher Innes, was a passenger on the 667 bus service operated by Regent Coaches travelling from Canterbury to Challock. He requested a stop at the junction with Nickle Cottages. The Mercedes Sprinter bus stopped in the westbound lane of the A28 Ashford Road, Chartham, Kent and Mr Innes alighted on the nearside (south side). He walked to the rear of the bus and began to cross the road in the direction of Nickle Cottages to the north of the two-lane single carriageway which had a speed restriction of 50 mph. In crossing the road, he was struck by a van travelling in the opposite direction to the bus. The van was being driven lawfully and within the speed limit for the road. He suffered fatal injuries following the collision and died on the A28 Ashford Road, Chartham on 25 May 2018.","(1) The presence and position of the unmarked bus stop on the carriageway, where Mr Innes alighted from the bus may be considered a hazard. The bus stop is known locally but is absent any signage or warning to approaching vehicles. The evidence revealed at the inquest was that this may have led to him being in a position of vulnerability at the side of the carriageway, where there is no footway available for use but only a small grass verge. In order to reach a footway to progress in either direction of the A28 at this point, Mr Innes was required to cross the carriageway to which a 50 mph speed limit applies and which has no pedestrian crossing facility in the vicinity.

(2) Although it is lawful for buses to stop at this location and the stop is recognised as a “hail and ride stop”, there is not at present signage indicating that this is a designated bus stop, and this is of concern given that the carriageway has a 50 mph speed limit.

(3) The vegetation close to the area where buses stop includes substantial trees and hedgerows alongside the carriageway and the close proximity of this to the carriageway causes restriction for any pedestrian alighting from the bus to negotiate an appropriate place to stand on a busy rural road prior to attempting to cross a 50 mph road. Although the Highways Department at Kent County Council have completed work in respect of cutting back vegetation as part of a site review on 31 October 2018, there is no clear responsibility for the management of the cutting of the vegetation and no clear indication of ownership of the land close to the bus stop as the Highway Authority did not concede any responsibility for the land adjoining the hard carriageway.",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,<NA>,Male,Pedestrian

Hon Chris Grayling MP, Secretary of State for Transport; His Honour Judge Mark Lucraft QC, The Chief Coroner for England and Wales",An investigation into the death of Julia Luxmore Peto commenced on 22 October 2018. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 March 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was that the medical cause of death was 1(a) head injury. The conclusion was “Road Traffic Accident”.,"On Sunday 16 September 2018, at about 16:53 pm, Julia was using a pedestrian crossing over the eastbound carriageway of Deptford Broadway, SE8 (A2), when a bus collided with her causing a catastrophic head injury. She died in hospital the following day. She was aged 27 years and did not have significant health problems or disabilities. She was crossing from the northside of Deptford Broadway to the southside.

The three lanes of the eastbound carriageway had split phasing of traffic light signals. When crossing the first two lanes of the eastbound carriageway the traffic had stopped at red traffic light signals. When she entered the third lane of the eastbound carriageway, which was a filter lane for vehicles turning right, the traffic light was green in favour of the approaching bus when the collision occurred. At the time she crossed the three lanes of the eastbound carriageway the pedestrian signal was red. There was a pedestrian island between the second and third lanes.

CCTV footage, from inside the bus, showed that she was looking to her left and when she stepped into the road she did not see the bus which was approaching from her right hand side.

The eastbound carriageway consisting of three lanes was the first part of a ‘two stage’ crossing, the westbound carriageway being the second stage.

At the time she was crossing the eastbound carriageway a green pedestrian light was displayed on the far side of the westbound carriageway. Based on the available evidence it was not possible to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that Julia had been confused by this particular green pedestrian signal.

The CCTV footage from the bus showed Julia moving at a pace, which was faster than walking, but not running, across the first and second lanes and continuing into the third lane where the collision occurred.

The driver of the bus passed eyesight breath and drug tests at the scene. He was travelling well below the speed limit of 30 mph through a green light, in his favour, and had applied the brakes before the collision occurred. The estimated speed of impact was below 4 mph. There were no mechanical problems with the bus.","I recorded in section 3 of the Record of Inquest that it was not possible to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that Julia had been confused by a green pedestrian signal on the other side of the Westbound carriageway of a ‘two stage’ crossing. Nonetheless I remain concerned that there is a strong possibility that she was distracted or confused by the green pedestrian light for the Westbound carriageway.

Transport for London (TfL) who are responsible for the signals, on the junction in question, have subsequently taken remedial measures to minimise the possibility of a recurrence of the accident by modifying the green pedestrian signals with louvres to reduce the risk of ‘see-through’ for pedestrians on the staggered pedestrian crossing.

TfL informed me, at the inquest, that they are putting in place “Look Left” and “Look Right” markings on the road to inform pedestrians on the direction of approaching traffic (A copy of the TfL report to me is appended for ease of reference. This contains a useful plan and photographs). From the evidence I heard I am satisfied that these particular changes would not have a wider impact on traffic flow but would improve the safety of pedestrians.

I was pleased to hear that TfL had taken proactive practical measures to reduce the risk at this particular junction but I remain concerned that there are likely be other “two stage” pedestrian crossings throughout England and Wales which also do not currently have louvres to prevent pedestrian ‘see-through’ and road markings to warn pedestrians of traffic direction.

I am therefore of the view that I am under a duty to report this wider concern to the Department of Transport to take appropriate action to reduce the risk of fatalities and serious injuries at two stage crossings throughout England and Wales.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,27,Female,Pedestrian

Gomersal,Cumbria,Cumbria County Council (Highways Department),"On 21 May 2018, Ms Kally Cheema (Senior Coroner) commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Andrew HENDERSON to whom I shall refer as Mikey.

On 7 June 2018, Mr Robert Chapman (Assistant Coroner) commenced an investigation into the death of Stephen Brian CHAMBERS to whom I shall refer as Stephen.

The investigations into Mikey’s and Stephen’s deaths concluded at the end of their inquests on 28 February 2019.

The conclusion of Mikey’s inquest was Road Traffic Collision. The medical cause of death of Mikey’s death was multiple injuries inconsistent with life.

The conclusion of Stephen’s inquest was Road Traffic Collision. The medical cause of death of Stephen’s death was multiple injuries inconsistent with life.","On 1 May 2018 at 21:30, Mikey was the driver of a car in which Stephen was the front seat passenger. It was raining heavily. Mikey was driving in a southerly direction along the A5094 New Road towards Whitehaven. Mikey lost control of the vehicle at speed. The vehicle skidded sideways into a concrete lamp-post. The force of the collision was such that the car was split in two horizontally. Both Mikey and Stephen were declared dead at the scene.

Mikey’s blood alcohol level was 166 mg per 100 ml of blood.

During the course of the inquest, I heard evidence from an experienced Collision Investigator with Cumbria Constabulary. The Collision Investigator could not tell exactly at what speed Mikey’s car had hit the lamppost. His opinion was that the car must have been travelling greatly in excess of the speed limit of 40 mph. The Collision Investigator advised me that he had never seen a car damaged to the extent that Mikey’s car was damaged.

The Collision Investigator concluded the collision occurred as a result of, or a combination of, alcohol, excess speed and poorly maintained rear tyres. My findings of fact incorporated the Collision Investigator’s conclusions.","During the course of the inquest, I read evidence from a police constable who attended the scene. He advised me that in his 24 years’ service, he was aware of a number of multiple fatal road traffic collisions on this road, mainly involving excess speed.

The Collision Investigator gave evidence in person. He has 22 years’ police service, the majority of which have been in the roads policing unit. He has been an expert collision investigator since 2011. The Collision Investigator advised me that the speed limit of 40 mph on New Road was appropriate and that relevant signage was appropriate. He was also aware of a number of fatal and serious collisions on New Road. Mikey and Stephen were the third and fourth deaths of which he was personally aware.

The Collision Investigator advised me that it is feasible to considerably exceed the speed limit on New Road to 60 or 70 mph or even greater. He advised me that the road has a number of unusual features – it is very wide with embankments and woodland on each side. It is not in a built up area. This may give the impression (despite signage) that the speed limit is much greater than 40 mph. The road travels downhill towards Whitehaven and has a number of bends.

The Collision Investigator was concerned that there could be further future deaths on this road because of the speeds that can be attained. His considered opinion was that there were measures that could be taken to reinforce and encourage compliance with the speed limit.

I fully appreciate that speed was not the only factor in Mikey’s and Stephen’s deaths. I also appreciate that it is not possible to “force” drivers to adhere to the speed limit. However, it may be that due to the unusual features of New Road that “traffic calming measures” may reduce the risk of future serious collisions and I recommend that that you give consideration to taking such action.",False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 15 February 2019. The conclusions of the Inquest were that Hoshi died on 11 January 2018 in Leeds General Infirmary from the effects of a severe traumatic brain injury sustained in a road traffic incident on 4 January 2018, and that this was a death due to a road traffic collision.","At around 18:25 hours on 4 January 2018, Hoshi was crossing the A6120 Leeds outer ring road when she was struck at a point close to the A6120/A58 roundabout by a car travelling on the eastbound carriageway.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 February 2018.

The medical cause of death is
1a multiple injuries

The conclusion of the inquest as to how Mr Morgan
came to his death is road traffic collision and is as follows:

The deceased died in a road traffic collision when a lorry lost control on the northbound carriageway of the A465 and crossed into the southbound carriageway and collided with the deceased’s oncoming vehicle. The driver of the lorry was not aware of his actions, however there is insufficient evidence how that loss of awareness materialised.","The deceased was Lyn Morgan, who was pronounced dead on 25 April 2013 at the scene of a road traffic collision on the southbound carriageway of the A465 road near Resolven. Lyn suffered traumatic injuries as a result of that collision. The other vehicle was a Renault 19 tonne artic lorry which consisted of the tractor engine unit and an unladen Montracon trailer adapted to carry logs and fitted with a crane for loading and unloading.

The lorry was travelling on the northbound carriageway of the A465. At approximately 15:40 the lorry was seen to veer from the nearside lane to the outside lane. The lorry then veered back to the nearside lane but kept moving left and off the carriageway onto the hard shoulder. The lorry continued along the hard shoulder and verge area before colliding with the nearside barrier. The lorry then left the barrier returning onto the carriageway but began sliding in a clockwise motion across both lanes of the northbound carriageway, then going over the top of the central reservation and onto the southbound carriageway into the path of Lyn’s van.","1. The barrier is designed to redirect the vehicle along its length, so that it doesn’t flip over or be redirected back onto the carriageway. On this occasion the height of the wheels and the lack of input on the steering wheel deflected the wheels and therefore redirected the lorry back onto the carriageway contrary to its design.
2. The road in question is extensively used by heavy vehicles and therefore the potential is there for these circumstances to arise again.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

O'Donnell,Cumbria,"Mr Jim O'Sullivan, Chief Executive, Highways England",On 17 January 2018 an investigation was commenced into the death of Mrs Doreen Fell who died at the age of 76 years old. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 February 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was accidental death.,"Mrs Fell was a recently widowed lady living in the Cumbrian village of Backbarrow. She had lived in the area all her life. Mrs Fell had a strong social group in the village; attending friends, family and the community centre on a daily basis. She had been the caretaker of the local primary school for many years prior to retirement.

The A590 bisects the village of Backbarrow. It is the only area of habitation along the 34 mile long A590 which contains a stretch of the road that maintains the national speed limit of 60mph. The relevant areas of this village shall be referred to as either the northbound side or the southbound side.

On 17 January 2018, Mrs Fell had visited her friend who lives on the southbound side of the village, and was making her way home to her property which is located on the northbound side. The time was 5.00pm and it was dark. She walked down Brow Edge Road to its junction with the A590 and walked several metres to the north to a pedestrian crossing. The crossing has been designed to offer pedestrians crossing the A590 safe harbour in a railed off central traffic island which is located in the middle of the north and southbound carriageways.

Mrs Fell crossed the southbound carriageway and made it on to central traffic island. She crossed the island to a dropped kerb in order to negotiate crossing the northbound carriageway. The breadth of the northbound carriageway at this point was 3.8m wide.

Mrs Fell allowed a white transit van to pass by and then commenced her crossing of the carriageway. She walked into the path of a black Honda Civic that was travelling at 50mph. She suffered catastrophic injuries and died at the scene.

The inquest heard from Cumbria Constabulary Collision Investigator [REDACTED] who had determined that:

• the vehicle was a distance of 16 to 25m away when Mrs Fell attempted to cross
• the vehicle was travelling at approximately 50mph which is the equivalent of 22.35 metres per second
• there was approximately 0.8 seconds between Mrs Fell stepping out and being struck by the vehicle
• the driver of the vehicle had no opportunity to react in such a period
• it would have taken Mrs Fell (walking at an average speed for a lady aged 60+ of 1.25 metres per second) 3.04 seconds to have crossed the northbound carriageway
• to ensure safe passage when crossing in front of a vehicle travelling at 50mph would require a safe gap of at least 67.94m (and indeed a distance of 81.47m if the car was lawfully travelling at 60mph)
• it was highly likely that Mrs Fell had failed to see the black car which was following in convoy behind the white transit van
• there is no artificial street lighting on the road (save for traffic warning lights on the traffic island itself to inform drivers of its presence)
• Mrs Fell would have been wholly reliant on judging distance by gauging the speed of approaching vehicles from variations in the approaching headlights alone.
• the lack of street lighting at this mid village crossing undoubtedly made it harder for any pedestrian to assess whether crossing the carriageway was safe to do so or not.

Additional relevant factors regarding Mrs Fell were:

a) she wore reactor light glasses which affected her ability to assess rapid changes in light
b) she had never passed a driving test or driven a car
c) she was suffering from early onset Alzheimer's disease which family members asserted could have affected her spatial perception
d) she crossed this carriageway daily to visit her friend

Relevant factors concerning this section of the A590 were:

a) it is a straight section of road sandwiched at either end by two dual carriageways: sustained speeds are regularly high in this area
b) the village and road is located at the base of a valley which inhibits the level of natural light on the road
c) the road at this point is bordered either side by continuous rows of very high trees further inhibiting the availability of natural light on the carriageway.

The family of Mrs Fell were accordingly of the view that this section of road is naturally fast and very dark at night.","1. The application of the national speed limit for this short section of trunk road whilst it passes through the village of Backbarrow directly impacts on:

a) reaction times for pedestrians
b) reaction times for drivers
c) the size of gap in traffic required to execute a safe pedestrian crossing

2. The low levels of natural light on this section accentuates the present lack of any street lighting on this section of road which may otherwise assist pedestrians with executing a safe crossing during the hours of darkness.

3. There is a village hall on the southbound side and a primary school on the northbound side of Backbarrow. It is foreseeable that children; the elderly or those with a physical or mental impairment will have occasion to cross this section of road. This aspect has a direct impact on the risk analysis applicable to points 1 & 2 above.

It is recommended that an urgent review of traffic safety for this section of the A590 which bisects the village of Backbarrow is undertaken, including particular analysis from a pedestrian's perspective.

As a footnote, it would seem that there are no signs indicating to residents, or visitors to the village, that there is an alternative route across the A590 via an underpass some 500m to the south of this accident. A review of applicable signage along this section of road is also suggested.",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,76,Female,Pedestrian

I arrived at a conclusion of road traffic collision.","At approximately 11.45am on 5 April 2018, Mr Norton was riding his motorcycle on the roundabout of the A644 Wakefield Road having approached the roundabout along Wakefield Road from the Cooper Bridge direction. Mr Norton was travelling around the roundabout in the offside lane with the intention of joining the M62 eastbound. At this time the driver of a Volvo motor vehicle entered the roundabout in the nearside lane, travelling from the Brighouse direction with the intention of travelling straight ahead towards Cooper Bridge. The driver of the motor vehicle was travelling around the roundabout with Mr Norton driving his motorcycle alongside. Once at the entry to the slip road Mr Norton moved from his offside lane into the path of the Volvo resulting in a collision with the offside front wing of the Volvo and causing Mr Norton to fall from his motorcycle and collide with a wooden fence adjacent to the slip road, tragically causing him to sustain fatal injuries. During the inquest I heard evidence to suggest that the road markings painted on the road surface were worn and difficult to read with the potential for causing motorists to be in the incorrect lane to exit the roundabout onto the entry slip to the M62. Given two lanes on the roundabout and two lanes on the slip road, I heard evidence that this could give the impression that exiting the roundabout onto the slip road is possible from either lane.","To consider the existing legibility of the painted road markings

Hocking,Leicester City and South Leicestershire,East Leicestershire Clinical Commissioning Group; Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust; Minister for Health (Mr Matthew Hancock),"On 8 December 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of David Reginald Bert Stacey

The inquest concluded on 14 December 2018 before a jury.

Cause of death 1a) Chest injuries sustained in a road traffic collision.","Mr Stacey was in his Toyota car on the A4304 Theddingworth Road at 11:02 on 27 November 2017, after a road traffic collision. Despite medical treatment he was pronounced dead at the scene. The road traffic collision was attributed to Mr Stacey driving at approximately 78 mph and crossing the double solid central line into oncoming traffic.

On 27 November 2017 at 00:23 the police received a 999 call from Mr Stacey's neighbour that Mr Stacey was at his neighbour's home and had allegedly been attacked. The police attended and took Mr Stacey back to his own home. Mr Stacey was agitated and worried the I.R.A were after him. The police decided that Mr Stacey needed to be seen by Triage Car to be assessed and they were called. Triage Car arrived and the senior mental health nurse spoke to Mr Stacey and decided he needed to be assessed under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. The Mental Health Act assessment team were contacted and the Triage Car nurse gave a handover to one of the doctors. The doctors agreed he needed to be assessed and said they would attend after they had finished their current assessment. The Triage Car team informed the police the Mental Health Act assessment team were on their way and they could leave when the next Mental Health Act assessment team arrived. The Mental Health Act assessment team arrived and were given a handover by the police. We feel unanimously that the handover was appropriate. After the handover the police left and we feel unanimously that the police officers should not have remained at the property whilst the assessment was taking place. We feel unanimously that there was no further police presence needed, despite the calls made. During the assessment there was concern by the Mental Health Act assessment team, however we feel unanimously that Mr Stacey's behaviour did not warrant the Mental Health Act assessment team leaving the premises. The doctors made the recommendation that Mr Stacey should be detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act and the AMHP accepted their recommendations. We feel unanimously that the AMHP became responsible for Mr Stacey's safety.

After the assessment, the Mental Health Act assessment team decided to leave the building and Mr Stacey was left alone. We feel unanimously that the level of risk was assessed appropriately as a high level of risk. The Mental Health Act assessment team then convened in a car outside to finish paperwork and escalated the case on to their respective line managers. Mr Stacey had no further known contact until 10:12 on 27 November when a 999 call was made by him. In this call he repeatedly used the phrase 'violet line', so we unanimously feel, that Mr Stacey was still suffering psychotic symptoms. Mr Stacey was then involved in a fatal road traffic collision at 11:02 on 27 November 2017. We accept the admission by the Leicestershire Partnership Trust that a bed was available for Mr Stacey and find that it was not communicated properly due to a serious failure in their process.

Additionally we find that Mr Stacey's death was contributed to by neglect by the Mental Health Act assessment team due to the team leaving Mr Stacey's property before other safeguards had been put in place.",One of the issues he identified was a failure to identify availability of a bed for cases of special urgency. This is a statutory requirement under section 140 of the Mental Health Act 1983 that the relevant health bodies (local Clinical Commissioning Group and Local Health Board) give advice to every social services authority within the area of arrangements that are in force for the reception of mentally disordered patients in cases of special urgency. The expert was in no doubt that Mr Stacey would have fulfilled the 'special urgency' category. It transpires from my further communication with the Leicestershire Partnership Trust that there is no such facility in Leicestershire. It would appear to be a statutory requirement that is currently being ignored and I am concerned that another similar situation might arise when there are no beds available to or identifiable by the local Trust.,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

The medical cause of death was found to be:
1a Multiple Traumatic Injuries
1b
1c
II","At approximately 16.23 hours on 2 August 2018, [REDACTED] was driving his [REDACTED] X1 vehicle, registration number [REDACTED] along the A3054 Wootton High Street in an easterly direction towards Kite Hill. He was driving within the speed limit of 30mph. The weather conditions were dry, warm and sunny. An elderly lady (Mrs VALVONA) was walking along the nearside pavement outside the Sloop Inn, she had her back towards the traffic travelling in the same direction as she was walking. Several drivers of vehicles travelling in the opposite direction had sensed that she might have been about to step out into the road to reach the bus-stop on the other side, possibly as they had seen her looking in that direction a moment earlier. The sun was coming from the south-west. Due to her eyesight issues, Mrs VALVONA found bright conditions to be dazzling and tended to wear a wide-brimmed hat, as she had been on that day, to reduce the glare. It is possible that Mrs VALVONA had indicated her intention to cross the road before Mr Hinch’s vehicle was close enough for him to see her.

Mrs VALVONA stepped out into the road without looking to her right before she did so. This placed her right in the pathway of Mr Hinch’s vehicle. He was unable to avoid her. He braked hard before the impact but she struck his vehicle and was thrown up onto the bonnet before landing in the road.

Mrs VALVONA suffered multiple serious traumatic injuries. One of the drivers travelling in the opposite direction to Mr Hinch witnessed the whole collision. She was an off-duty paramedic. Immediately she went to Mrs VALVONA’s aid. An Air Ambulance was requested due to the severity of Mrs VALVONA’s injuries and she was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital where she was admitted to the General Intensive Care Unit.

After assessing her, the clinicians caring for Mrs VALVONA were of the opinion that the most appropriate treatment for her was palliative care as there was a poor prognosis and an almost inevitable risk of death from the multiple traumatic injuries that she had sustained, although she did have some surgical treatment to reduce the risk of infection in the open fracture in her leg. Mrs VALVONA’s family were in agreement with this approach.

Mrs VALVONA died at Southampton General Hospital at 13.50 hours on 20 August 2018.","1. I have concerns about the lack of a safe place for pedestrians to cross the A3054 at that point. There are a great many elderly people who visit the Sloop Inn due to the affordability of the roast meals there, and I heard evidence that there are over 40 elderly people living in Homebray House which is a short distance up the steep hill that is Wootton High Street many of whom enjoy visiting this pub/restaurant.

2. The A3054 is a busy single-lane carriageway road with one lane in each direction taking much traffic from the ferry terminal at Fishbourne to Newport, the County town, and beyond. It is the main link between Newport in the west and Ryde on the east of the Island and this stretch of road is predominantly residential in nature. Whilst there is a crossing higher up the hill on Wootton High Road, if pedestrians have mobility issues – as Mrs VALVONA did - they are unable to walk up the steep 4° hill incline to reach the crossing.

3. There have been 7 slight injury accidents in the vicinity in the 5 years leading up to 31.12.2017, and I heard evidence that there is a local pressure group which has been campaigning for a crossing of some sort to be installed to make this popular site for traversing the road to be safer. I also heard that there have been a large number of near-miss incidents which don’t feature in the statistics. There is an increased tendency for pedestrians to want to cross the road at this point as there is a bus-stop opposite the Sloop Inn which stops further up the hill, in the middle of Wootton High Street, and thereby means that those with mobility issues don’t have to negotiate the hill on foot.

4. Whilst the road is almost too narrow at that point to accommodate the inclusion of a traffic island (bearing in mind the number of HGVs that traverse that stretch of road), Senior Investigating Officer Police [REDACTED] said in evidence that he would support the proposition that either a pelican or zebra crossing be installed at this point to prevent future deaths as it would mean that the traffic has to stop to allow pedestrians to get across safely.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,90,Female,Pedestrian

Brown,Northumberland,"Legal Director, Volvo Group (UK) Limited","On 24 November 2017, assisted by a jury, I concluded an inquest into the death of Maurice Leslie Wrightson, a coach driver from Ashington, Northumberland, who died in France on 16 April 2013 as the result of a road traffic collision. The circumstances of Mr Wrightson’s death were summarised by the jury as follows:-

‘On 16 April 2013 at approximately 13.45 hours Maurice Leslie Wrightson was bringing 51 British passengers home to the United Kingdom on Departmental Road No. 211 between La Garde-en-Oisans and Bourg-d’Oisans approaching the hairpin bend number 21, when he realised the brakes were no longer responding. To stop the coach and not risk tipping into the ravine, he chose instead to crash into the rocks on the side of this bend, opposite the coach’s path. When it hit the boulders near the steep bend number 21 the coach burst into flames and as a result Maurice Leslie Wrightson’s death was pronounced at 14.45 hours on the same day’.",,"During the hearing evidence was heard that Mr Wrightson was using i-shift automatic gears while driving the coach, and a foot retarder, in addition to the normal vehicle brakes during the long mountain descent.

The inquest heard from a former Depot Manager [REDACTED] that following Mr Wrightson’s death, he checked with other coach drivers in the employment of Classic Coaches, Durham, at the time, as to their usual driving practice and found that their driving practices were equally divided. Some drivers engaged manual gears and others used automatic i-shift gears during mountain descents. Mr Shipley took the decision to instruct all drivers to use manual gears during long mountain descents.

Evidence was heard that driving uphill, an automatic gear system works on the principle of climbing with a low gear initially until the vehicle gains momentum and automatically steps up to the next gear as resistance lowers and speed increases. Conversely, going downhill the use of automatic gears would have less resistance and increased momentum, causing a need for additional braking. [REDACTED] informed the inquest that he had tried to clarify the position with Volvo as to the recommendations contained in the Vehicle Manual, which gave a clear recommendation as to the use of vehicle gears while going uphill but was silent as to any recommendation when going downhill. [REDACTED] said that in attempting to clarify the situation with the vehicle manufacturers, the reply he received was that drivers ‘should follow the information or advice contained in the Vehicle Manual’.

The manufacturers (Volvo) had not been recognised as an interested person or invited to attend the inquest because this was a point which arose during the hearing of [REDACTED] evidence at the inquest itself.

[REDACTED] evidence was that the Volvo handbook wallet for the B12B and B12M produced in 2004 has a driver’s handbook, operating instructions display booklet, operating instructions EBS booklet and operating instructions i-shift gearbox booklet which gives guidance only in relation to driving up a hill and the locking gear.

In respect of subsequent Volvo models the advice remains the same except that later dated manuals advise ‘caution in respect of brake fade in long descents’. There is no warning that automatic mode is likely to exacerbate brake fade in long descents (such as at Alp D’Huez).

[REDACTED] told the inquest that he would at that time, as a PCV driver himself, have done exactly the same as Maurice Wrightson and used automatic mode. The Volvo manual gives no guidance to drivers for downhill driving such that automatic gearbox mode would be selected rather than manual by most drivers. Owners and drivers are reliant on the manufacturer to supply adequate instructions on the use of these technological advancements fitted to their vehicles.

However, it seems to me that the lack of information contained in the Vehicle Manual may lead to a lack of understanding or uncertainty, and there is a risk that this may lead to future deaths.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 November 2018.

The Medical Cause of Death was:

Ia Multiple chest, abdominal and pelvic injuries

The conclusion of the inquest was that Rowan Lloyd died as a consequence of a road traffic collision.","On the afternoon of 6 June 2018, Rowan Lloyd was cycling home from school. He was cycling south on the eastern pavement of Portland Road. The road traffic was heavy, and there were both pedestrians and cyclists on the pavement at the time of the collision.

As Rowan reached the junction of Portland Road, Murley Road and Langton Avenue, he collided with the traffic signal pole and fell to his right, into the road. At that time, a Mercedes Arcos Heavy Tractor and semi-trailer was pulling away from the signal controlled junction. Rowan fell under the wheels of the trailer, sustaining multiple injuries. Rowan was pronounced dead at the scene.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. I heard evidence that the junction of Portland Road, Murley Road and Langton Avenue is a particularly busy junction during the rush hours and during the ""school runs"", as Portland Road is the main road into Portland and this junction is close to a number of schools. However, I heard evidence that there are no crossing points for pedestrians at the junction, no advanced stop line for cyclists, no cycle lane and no barriers between the road and the pavement on the approach to the traffic signals.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. Pedestrians have to ""guess"" when the lights are in their favour, depending upon the road they intend to cross at the junction: there is no pelican crossing at the junction to assist pedestrians, many of who are of school age, to cross safely at this junction.
ii. There is no barrier between the pavement and the road as the junction is approached from the north. This allows pedestrians and cyclists to potentially cross between cars that are held at the junction by the lights, and would mean cars travelling in a northerly direction up Portland Road would have an obscured view of those crossing the road between stationary vehicles.
iii. There is no accommodation for cyclists. Given that many of the cyclists using this road will be of school age, particular care needs to be taken to ensure that cyclists can use the road safely and be clearly seen by drivers using Portland Road, perhaps by way of dedicated cycle lanes and/or advanced stop lines at the traffic signals.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,14,Male,Cyclist

The cause of death was:

1a Multiple injuries
b Road Traffic Collision","i) At 17:03 hours on Monday 22 January 2018 a fatal road traffic collision occurred on the A4030 Bearwood Road, Bearwood, Birmingham.

ii) The sun had set, light was fading, but it was dry and visibility was good.

iii) A West Midlands Travel Volvo double decked bus, registered number BU51 RVM, was being driven in heavy traffic in a southerly direction along Bearwood Road by [REDACTED] towards the A456 Hagley Road.

iv) The bus stopped near to the junction with Poplar Road, which was ahead and to its relative nearside.

v) Mrs Tipper was crossing across the mouth of the junction of Poplar Road in a southerly direction, heading towards the carriageway of Bearwood Road.

vi) It appears that Mrs Tipper was most likely in the blind spot of the nearside “A” pillar of the bus, as the traffic and bus have started to move.

vii) Evidence suggests that as the bus continued to move forward and is likely to have been partially available to be seen in close relative proximity to the nearside “A” pillar of the bus.

viii) The bus driver would only have been able to see her in his peripheral vision as they both moved in a southerly direction, unless he had specifically looked in the region of the nearside “A” pillar.

ix) Evidence from witnesses suggests that once the bus had begun moving forward, the driver’s focus was directed forwards.

x) Mrs Tipper then collides with the bus and the nearside wheels of the bus have travelled over her legs causing severe crush injuries.

xi) The bus was travelling at a speed of around 6 mph.

xii) The driver has continued along Bearwood Road before coming to a halt at traffic lights with the A456 Hagley Road. Whilst stationary, members of the public have informed him there has been a collision.

xiii) Sadly, Mrs Tipper later died in hospital as a result of the injuries she sustained.",1.

Nana was confirmed as having died at the scene at 0425 on 24 December 2017 as a result of having sustained a chest trauma with haemorrhage when his Ford Fiesta motor car collided with a DAF light goods vehicle travelling in the opposite direction on a left-hand bend on the A429 heading south towards Lower Stanton St Quintin in Wiltshire (OS ref ST 911 817). It is unclear as to why Nana had been on the opposite side of the highway (restricted by worn road markings) and he was attempting to return to the correct side of the highway when the collision occurred. Nana had been drinking alcohol (96mg/dl blood alcohol) prior to the incident and this more likely than not was a contributory factor in the collision occurring.

Consistent with what I recorded elsewhere on the record of inquest as a conclusion I recorded – road traffic collision.",,"Whilst the state of the road surface appears to be in good condition what is not in good condition are the road markings. It is clear from the first picture that this section of road being a sharp left-hand bend travelling south is subject to no overtaking restrictions in both directions. Looking at the photographs the white lines that should be present in the centre of the highway have been significantly worn away to the extent that immediately approaching the left-hand bend they are non-existent. I was informed and as can be seen from the photograph in the police collision report, the cats eyes are also not in working condition.

I appreciate that one should drive at a speed relative to the road conditions but in this instance, it is clear from the photographs that the road markings effectively suddenly disappear as a result of road wear. Whilst I was not able to make a finding on a balance of probabilities that the absence and the poor state of these central road markings more likely than not contributed to Nana losing positional awareness on the highway and crossing onto the opposite side of the highway where upon a collision then ensued as he attempted to return to his side of the highway, it does remain a possibility hence this report.

I am sure you will appreciate road markings provide not only guidance to road users so that they can position their vehicle accordingly on the public highway but also serve to provide information to road users, as in this case, that this section of highway was subject to no overtaking in both directions. I would ask in view of this report that you urgently review this section of highway as its current state in terms of road markings is of great concern to me.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

Dorries,Yorkshire West Western,"Mr John Mothersole, Chief Executive, Sheffield City Council",In January 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Leslie Bingham. The investigation concluded following an inquest in June 2018 where the jury’s narrative conclusion (copy attached) was to the effect that Mr Bingham died from injuries received when he was hit by a police vehicle whilst crossing the A61 Penistone Road at Owlerton Green.,"Mr Bingham had approached the A61 along Owlerton Green on his way to a family celebration at the Greyhound Stadium. He was not affected by drink or other substances. The exact path taken from the kerb on the west side of Penistone Rd (ie: adjacent to the Pizza Hut) is unknown but Mr Bingham got safely onto the first pedestrian refuge which is roughly triangular in shape. At this point he had only crossed the lane for traffic turning left into Owlerton Green and still had the two northbound lanes of the A61 to cross. The evidence was that Mr Bingham then stepped into the northbound lanes of the A61 notwithstanding the approaching police vehicle. It is clear that the traffic lights for the police vehicle were on green.

The final conclusion of the jury as to the crossing itself reflected evidence (and in particular a viewing) as regards the positioning of the red/green pedestrian indicator lights on the triangular refuge. Mr Bennett from the City Council was present throughout and can no doubt assist you further but in summary the jury feared that a pedestrian approaching from Owlerton Green might be misled by a green pedestrian light intended only for those crossing the mouth of Owlerton Green in a northbound direction. The sequence is such that this (first) light will be green for a large part of the time that the pedestrian indicator to cross the northbound lanes of Penistone Road is red. The first light has been designed to be particularly bright with a narrow viewing angle but it is highly visible to those approaching from Owlerton Green, particularly if the corner to reach the refuge is cut very slightly. The jury were plainly of the view that Mr Bingham may have had only this bright green light in mind as he progressed towards the refuge and thought that this gave him clearance to cross the A61 in front of the approaching traffic which he may well have assumed was being shown a red light.

I would respectfully agree with the jury’s conclusion on this point. Whilst this is a difficult junction to provide for, it remains a significant hazard with a high likelihood of serious injury for anyone who makes this error.",The evidence showed that there was a significant possibility that a pedestrian approaching the A61 from Owlerton Green adjacent to the Pizza Hut may be misled by a green light intended for pedestrians crossing the mouth of Owlerton Green and thus miss a red light prohibiting them crossing the northbound lanes of the A61.,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Pedestrian

The jury found the medical cause of death to be:

1a. Blunt head and neck trauma

The jury determined that JJ Wilson died as a result of an accident.","At the time of his death, JJ had completed building a Tatuus Formula 3 car (“the Tatuus”) with some limited assistance from another mechanic. He along with 3 other work colleagues took the Tatuus to Longcross Race Track on 21 February 2018 for what is called a shakedown test, and JJ was the driver for this. The Court heard evidence that the shakedown was meant to be completed at between 50 and 70 miles per hour, but that JJ had driven at speeds of up to 137 miles per hour.
During the final laps of the shakedown, a bolt which was meant to hold the front nearside upper wishbone of the Tatuus came undone and the Court heard evidence this was because it had not been tightened to the correct torque when the Tatuus was constructed. This caused an irreparable loss of control of the Tatuus, which left the track and the front nearside wheel collided with a concrete block, became detached and caused the car to rotate and roll onto its offside before colliding with a tree. JJ suffered serious head and neck injuries as a result of this collision which caused his instantaneous death.","It is not obligatory for fire retardant overalls to be worn by test track drivers which creates a potential risk of death or serious injury in the event of a crash in circumstances similar to that which caused the death of JJ Wilson;

Caller,London Inner West,"Head of Legal Service, General Counsel Transport for London; Head of Shared Legal Services Wandsworth, Merton, Richmond and Sutton","On Friday 26 January 2018 Russell Caller, HM Assistant Coroner, conducted an inquest into the death of Lucia Ciccioloi which occurred on Monday 24 October 2016.

The view of the evidence based upon photographs and CCTV and the evidence of the collision investigator was that the collision took place on Monday 24 October 2016 just to the west of the cross road on Lavender Hill, junction with Elspeth Road, leading westbound towards Clapham Junction train station.

Lavender Hill runs east to west across the road. North of the cross road is Latchmere Road and south is Elspeth Road. Vehicles passing through this junction are controlled by a system of automatic traffic lights (ATS). Pedestrians are provided with crossing on each four mouths of the junction. It was clear and the road surface was wet.

The circumstances of the collision are that Miss Lucia Ciccioli was cycling westbound on Lavender Hill, heading westbound through the ATS controlled cross road junction with Elspeth Road. Miss Lucia Ciccioloi approached the road from lane one, which is a dedicated left turn lane into Elspeth Road. Approximately 20 metres west of the cross road junction the collision occurred.

[REDACTED] was driving westbound on Lavender Hill in a white/blue MAN, articulated lorry registration [REDACTED]. He continued straight ahead from lane two of Lavender Hill which is a dedicated lane for going straight ahead only.

As Miss Lucia Ciccioloi has exited the junction intending to head west (and not turning left into Elspeth Road) she has been struck by the MAN lorry approximately 20 metres past the junction.

Miss Lucia Ciccioloi received fatal injuries as a result of the collision and died at the scene. On Monday 24 October 2016 at 08.12 hours life was pronounced extinct by [REDACTED].

Attached to this report is a CCTV reconstruction plan (the ""Reconstruction Plan"") to assist with the description of the collision given above.","The evidence was that Miss Lucia CICCIOLOI moved from lane one (dedicated to the left turn into ELSPETH Road) into lane two as she crossed the junction (position 3 on the Reconstruction Plan) cycling towards LAVENDER HILL where the road appeared to narrow and Lucia CICCIOLOI travelled over a dip in the road where it appeared as if a pothole had not been repaired which caused her to lose her balance and fall and collide with the MAN lorry.

During the Inquest it was suggested that the cycle lane (see area coloured pink on the Reconstruction Plan) was possibly misplaced and cyclists had difficulty in using the same due to its very close proximity to lane two particularly when large vehicles (in particular lorries) were in lane two. Notwithstanding that cyclists wished to remain in the centre of the road cyclists felt obliged to place themselves in lane one even though that was a dedicated route to the left into ELSPETH ROAD.

Moreover, cyclists found it extremely difficult to keep to the middle of the road as they crossed the junction due to an apparent ""narrowing of the road"" and a yellow box junction positioned in the middle of the junction (in which they could not legally stop). Further cause for concern was that there was a pothole positioned between position 4 and position 5 of the Reconstruction Plan which required urgent repair.","1) There is an inadequate cycle lane leading up to the traffic lights at the junction with Latchmere Road and Elspeth Road (the cycle lane is coloured pink on the Reconstruction Plan).

2) There is inadequate protection generally for cyclists riding towards the junction with Latchmere Road and Elspeth Road, particularly for those cyclists that wish to go straight over the said junction towards Lavender Hill or for those cyclists that wish to turn right at that junction into Latchmere Road.

3) There is a yellow box in the middle of the said junction (situated between position 3 and 4 on the Reconstruction Plan) which causes concerns to cyclists when they are either proceeding straight on or turning right from the junction as they are prevented from legally stopping in the said yellow box.

4) There is no cycle lane provision in Lavender Hill immediately past the said junction.

5) The narrow aspect of Lavender Hill immediately past the said junction places cyclists in a vulnerable position when they arrive in Lavender Hill from the said junction.

6) The dip in the road in Lavender Hill (between position 4 and position 5 on the Reconstruction Plan) is dangerous and is in need of urgent repair.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Female,Cyclist

Smith,Greater Lincolnshire,Highways Department Lincolnshire County Council,"On 28 October 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Harry James Jellicoe aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 March 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Jellicoe died as a result of a road traffic collision, the medical cause of death being: 1a. Traumatic brain injury 2. Rib fractures and lung contusions","On 16 October 2016 Mr Jellicoe was driving his MG TF motor car, registered number YT 03 OSU eastbound on the A151 road between Colsterworth and Corby Glen, Lincolnshire. Although not raining at the time, it had previously rained heavily and the road surface was wet.

Shortly before reaching Corby Glen Mr Jellicoe reached a point at which the road passed underneath a bridge carrying a railway line.

Mr Jellicoe drove underneath the bridge. The road turned to his right at an angle of over 30 degrees and began to climb uphill. As Mr Jellicoe followed the road, he lost control of his vehicle which left the carriageway to the nearside, suffering a heavy impact with a roadside tree. Mr Jellicoe suffered severe injuries from which he died in hospital some days later.

Despite that history, the vehicle was found to have front tyres which were each extensively worn and displaying significantly less than the legal minimum depth of tread required. Evidence was received that the pattern of wear was likely to have resulted from a longstanding misalignment of a steering or suspension component within the vehicle.

The cause of the loss of control and consequent road traffic collision was found to be a combination of the speed at which the vehicle was driven, the wet road conditions prevailing at the time and the lack of tread on the front tyres which arose from the manner in which the vehicle had been set up.","(I) The section of road where this incident occurred is subject to no specific speed restriction. The national speed limit applied.

(ii) The nature of the bridge construction imposes a height restriction on vehicles passing underneath of 4.6m (15 feet 3 inches).

(III) The arch of the bridge is such that the full height is only available to vehicles using the centre of the carriageway. The bridge properly bears clear signage advising of that risk and guiding high sided vehicles towards the centre of the carriageway.

(IV) I received evidence that on both approaches to the bridge there is clear signage warning drivers of the existence of the bridge and its height restriction, and advising high sided vehicles to utilise the centre of the available carriageway.

(V) Although traffic approaching from the west has a clear view of the bridge for some considerable distance, the nature of the landscape is such that it is not possible to see any significant distance beyond the bridge arch to identify traffic, especially high sided vehicles which may be occupying the centre of the carriageway, approaching from the east.

(VI) Similarly, and for the same reasons, traffic approaching from the east has a much reduced view of the approach to the bridge and cannot identify traffic approaching from the west.

(VII) In light of the current signage and proper recommendation that high sided vehicles utilise the centre of the carriageway, given the restricted line of vision through the bridge arch, you may feel that the current speed limit is too high and requires revision. Likewise, there is no signage indicating priority of passage where high sided vehicles are required to utilise the full carriageway.

(VIII) Whilst I received evidence that there have been very few reported collisions involving HGVs at this location, there was a clear consensus among the local drivers who gave evidence that this location posed a significant potential hazard, for the reasons given above, particularly for those motorists who were not familiar with the area.",False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,26,Male,Driver

Shah,Northamptonshire,Northamptonshire Highways; Northamptonshire County Council Highways Agency,On 25/10/2017 I commenced an inquest into the death of Darryl Alfred Wayne Rego Souza aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23/03/2018. The conclusion was that Mr Souza died as a result of a road traffic collision.,"Mr Souza died on Saturday 7 October 2017 at the crossroad junction of Naseby Road and Longhold Road, Clipston, Northamptonshire as a result of fatal chest injuries sustained when the motorcycle he was riding was involved in a collision with a Mini motor vehicle.

Mr Souza had approached the scene on Longhold Road travelling from Sibbertoft. On Mr Souza’s approach, at a point 100m from the crossroads, the road negotiates a slight left hand curve and at the same location two warning signs are located at the near and the off side of the road with attached boards underneath that state “Give Way 100 Yards”. The road then straightens and it is possible to see straight over the crossroads through to the Kelmarsh road. Just prior to the junction, a “Give Way” sign is sited on the nearside grass verge. Faded, but visible give way lines then control the junction.

The Mini motor vehicle had been travelling on Naseby Road heading from Clipston towards Naseby. Approaching the scene from Clipston, the main Naseby Road leaves the village exiting the 30 mph zone and entering the 60 mph zone that is applicable up to and including the site of the accident which is 600m away. The road travels straight for a short distance before it then curves to the left round a slight bend. Once round the bend the road is straight and descends a slight decline towards the scene of the incident. As the scene is approached, the Naseby Road can be seen turning to the left up ahead and prior to this left hand bend, a crossroads warning sign mounted on a high visibility yellow board is situated to the near side of the road with a plate mounted underneath it stating “110 yards”. “Slow” is painted on the road surface adjacent to the road and although faded is visible. A further conventional cross road sign is situated towards the later end of the curve on the grass verge near the near side footpath and again, “Slow”, is painted on the road surface adjacent to this sign.

Mr Souza was riding a sports motor cycle which meant he had a low position in the road. There were hedges on his approach which obscured his view of Naseby Road ahead. There were windows of increased visibility but these closed down the closer that he got to the junction. Mr Souza had slowed to 10-15 mph then almost came to a stop at the crossroads.

At the junction, the maximum unhindered view of Naseby Road to his left was 79m. A vehicle travelling at the applicable speed limit (60 mph) would cover 79m in 2.9 seconds. The Forensic Collision Investigator concluded it was…
“possible that when Darryl emerged from Longhold Road, the driver of the Mini would not have had time to take any avoiding action”…
Mr Souza sustained serious chest injuries having collided with the A-pillar of the Mini and sadly succumbed to his injuries at the scene.

There was no evidence of dangerous or excess speed from either driver or rider. There were no defects in either vehicle that could have contributed to the accident. The weather and road conditions were favourable.","1. Paragraphs 6.11 – 6.14 of the Forensic Collision Investigator’s report is set out below.

6.11 There is no doubt that the visibility at this junction is compromised by the road geography and as such high visibility “Give Way” signs and crossroads signs together with “SLOW” painted on the road surface serve to highlight the location of the crossroads and the need to take care.

6.12 In view of the visibility at this junction and after reviewing the collision statistics at this junction there are to be some improvements carried out.

6.13 These improvements include renewing the signing particularly from the Sibbertoft direction and noise or rumble strips to be placed on the road again from the Sibbertoft direction.

6.14 At the time of writing this report, there is no time frame as to when these improvements will be completed.

2. Additionally, during evidence, the Collision Investigator recommended that the junction may benefit from the installation of “Stop” signs.

3869,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/molly-mills/,2018-0051,2018-02-21,H. Connor,Nottinghamshire,Anthony May – Chief Executive of Nottinghamshire County Council; Group Manager of Highways; Chief Coroner,On 20 September 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Molly Jean Mills. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 February 2018. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision.,"Jean was driving on the A6006 Melton Road, near to the village of Stanford on Soar in Nottinghamshire, on the morning of 6 June 2017. She was involved in a collision with a lorry at the junction which has entrances to Home Farm on one side, and the Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (‘DNRC’, currently under construction) on the other.

Jean was travelling in the direction of Zouch, and made a right turn towards Home Farm, into the path of a lorry travelling on the A6006 towards Rempstone.

Jean’s injuries were initially not thought to be life-threatening, but she died in hospital on 17 July 2017 after contracting bronchopneumonia, because of the rib fractures she suffered in the collision. Although Jean also suffered a fall in hospital, I concluded that the injuries she sustained in the collision were the cause of her bronchopneumonia and death. I was assisted in this respect by evidence from a consultant radiologist and a Home Office pathologist.

We had clear evidence (via tachograph and dashcam footage) that the lorry was not speeding. The driver was not under the influence of alcohol. Whilst the driver reacted quickly and applied his brakes when Jean’s vehicle appeared in front of him, he did not have sufficient opportunity to avoid the collision. I found no fault with the lorry driver’s manner of driving or the action he took to try to avoid the collision.

I found that Jean made her manoeuvre without checking adequately for oncoming traffic. Driver error undoubtedly played a part.

However, I also reached the conclusion that the layout of the junction made a collision like this more likely. The layout poses a risk of future deaths.","1. There is a significant incline on this road (in the direction the lorry was travelling). This makes the visibility issues referred to below much more significant.
2. If there are vehicles in the central carriageway waiting to turn right into both the DNRC and Home Farm, as here, there is a risk of them having an inadequate view of oncoming traffic on the A6006, before making their turning manoeuvres.
3. This is the case in both directions, but particularly for vehicles travelling in the direction towards Rempstone, because of the incline of the road.
4. The evidence of the lorry driver was that he did not see Jean’s car until she turned in front of his vehicle.
5. The evidence of the Forensic Collision Investigation Unit officer was that Jean’s view would have been largely or completely blocked by vehicles waiting to turn right into DNRC until 2.93 seconds before impact.
6. Witness evidence suggested that the right turn into DNRC is often backed up, resulting in queues in this central lane, making visibility worse. It was suggested this may be partly because of a security barrier in the DNRC grounds, which causes traffic to back up. This is likely to remain a busy junction when the DNRC opens.
7. If the oncoming vehicle (coming up the incline towards Rempstone) was a standard vehicle, rather than a lorry, visibility would be even worse, given that the cab of a lorry is higher up.
8. Similarly, if the vehicles waiting to turn right (into Home Farm and DNRC) were lorries or other large vehicles, such as ambulances, then visibility concerns would be heightened further.
9. There is an element of uncertainty at the junction – where both vehicles are turning right – there is no clear indication of who has right of way or how the vehicles should make their manoeuvres.
10. There is a solid double white line on the road just before the turning into Home Farm. This requires a driver turning right to make a sharp-angled turn.
11. The signs on either side of the junction warn oncoming traffic of the DNRC junction, but not the Home Farm junction. The fact that the Home Farm road is a private road should not reduce the need for adequate safety warnings to drivers.
12. I have been provided with a Nottinghamshire County Council Road Safety Audit regarding this junction, which is dated 21.9.15. This contains the following extract:
During the site visit we were approached by a member of the public (apparently the owner) from Home Farm, opposite the Stanford Hall Access. He brought to our attention an issue which he felt had safety implications. Drivers intending to turn right into the Home Farm access have to wait on their side of the A6006 centre line to give way to oncoming traffic, as previously. They then have to turn across both the right turn lane and the eastbound A6006 traffic lane. If a number of vehicles were occupying the right turn lane, he felt there would be potential to mask oncoming A6006 vehicles from view. Although the existing situation requires a right turner to wait in the westbound lane of the A6006, he also felt that he would be at greater risk of shunt type accidents than previously.
13. Sadly, this appears to have been the very risk that played a part in this collision.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Female,Driver

Griffin,Dorset,"Debbie Ward, Chief Executive of Dorset County Council","On 20 October 2016, an investigation was commenced into the death of Aaron George Nordass-Lacey, born on 6 July 1995.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 January 2018.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Aaron George Nordass-Lacey died when he fell from his bicycle and was struck by a motor vehicle, but the sequence of events as to how he sustained his injuries is unclear, even on the balance of probabilities.","On 13 October 2016, the deceased was riding his father's Corratec X-vert Cross Pedal Cycle along the A35, Barrack Road, Christchurch at Bailey Bridge. He made his way onto the central reservation of that road and fell from his bike towards the carriageway into the path of an oncoming motor vehicle. He sustained unsurvivable injuries to his head and chest and despite being taken to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, his death was confirmed there a short time later that day. The sequence of how he sustained his injuries is not clear, whether he hit the ground before he was struck by the car, whether the car struck him before he hit the ground, or whether both occurred at the same time.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. The road where the incident occurred that led to Aaron's death, the A35 Barrack Road, Christchurch, Dorset is a road which has a speed limit of 30 miles per hour. Evidence was given that people regularly drive at excessive speeds on this road. The location of the incident is near to a school and evidence was given that people, especially school children, do not always use the designated crossing just prior to the junction of Clarendon Road and Barrack Road. Evidence was given that school children often flood out of the school and run into the road. Evidence was given that this was perceived to be a danger and that there could be the death of a person in the future.

ii. The placement of barriers along this section of road would assist in reducing the access to the road and encouraging pedestrians to use the crossing to cross the road safely, reducing the potential dangers and risk to life. It was also suggested that a fixed speed camera may assist in regulating the speed of vehicles that use the road.

iii. Evidence was also given in relation to the cycle lane along Barrack Road. The cycle lane along Barrack Road heading towards Christchurch is on the footpath and is a shared cycle lane and footpath. The cycle lane comes to an end just before the junction of Clarendon Road and evidence was given by the Collision Reduction Team Manager that the expectation is that when the cycle lane comes to an end, cyclists will cross the road and use the cycle path on the footpath on the other side of the road. Although there is a sign at the end of the cycle lane it is not clear that the expectation is for the cyclist to cross over the road at the crossing. The lack of signage is therefore very confusing and could lead to a further collision.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. The safety of pedestrians and cyclists who use Barrack Road, Christchurch where the incident that led to Aaron's death occurred. I would therefore request that there is a review of the safety measures in place and consideration is given to the erection of barriers along the pavement and also along the central reservation to discourage pedestrians and cyclists from crossing the road in a dangerous manner.

ii. I would also request that a review is undertaken regarding the signage given to cyclists at this location and consideration be given to having a fixed speed camera at this location.",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,21,Male,Cyclist

II","At approximately 20.20 hours on 7 September 2016, [REDACTED] was driving her Nissan Almera in an easterly direction along Coach Lane, Brading, Isle of Wight. She indicated to turn right across Coach Lane at the junction with Park Road. She did not see any vehicle coming in the opposite direction.

Mr DANIEL was travelling on his motorcycle in a westerly direction on Coach Lane, Brading. He pulled out to overtake several legally parked cars (denoted on the attached map), necessitating that he was temporarily travelling on the wrong side of the narrow road. Forensic Collision Investigators have subsequently estimated that he was exceeding the speed limit of 30 mph and travelling at approximately 45 mph.

Mr DANIEL collided with Mrs Warrington’s motor car and was thrown off his motorcycle into the road. The driver in the vehicle which was travelling behind Mrs Warrington’s car had no opportunity to take evasive action, and Mr DANIEL was struck by this second vehicle too.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 December 2017. I made a determination of death by road traffic collision, when Mr Welsh was knocked over by a lorry whilst crossing Duke’s Road at the junction with Euston Road in London at approximately 9.30am on Thursday, 6 July 2017.

The medical cause of death was:
1a multiple injuries.","Despite travelling at just 7 miles per hour, the lorry driver turning left into Duke’s Road from Euston Road would only have had a second to see Mr Welsh as a hazard, through the front passenger cab window, before the pedestrian disappeared from his view.

The lorry would have been visible to Mr Welsh and it did have its indicator on, but because it had to swing out to make the turn, it might have appeared to him that the lorry was going to carry straight on along Euston Road, falsely reassuring him that it was safe to cross.","I heard at inquest that:

• Transport for London (TfL) made a decision in 2007 that it would not undertake any consideration of pedestrian crossings at that crossroads until after the completion of HS1;
• £50,000 was paid to TfL in 2009 by UNISON as part of planning permission to allow building on the opposite corner, £20,000 of which was used on a feasibility study in 2013, but TfL decided that traffic flow would be impeded by four pedestrian crossings, so none was installed and use was not made of the remaining £30,000;
• UNISON has made several complaints to Camden Council/TfL about the dangers of this particular crossroads, but TfL’s best expectation of delivery of any improvement is for the year 2020.

I appreciate that every decision about traffic control at one junction must be taken in the context of the whole network, but 13 years after the issue was first raised seems an inordinately long time to wait for some improvement at such a busy crossroads (about which there had been several complaints prior to this fatality).

Consideration of the junction was described to me as being based on four new crossings or none, which I did not quite understand.

The statistics upon which TfL decisions about traffic control are based, were described to me by TfL’s lead sponsor as only taking account of the proportion of collisions/accidents that result in serious injury or death, not taking into account the overall incidence of collisions/accidents (or even taking into account reported near misses).

The conclusion of the inquest was as set out in the narrative questionnaire completed by the jury, a copy of which is attached.","Mr Basalat was arrested on 09/12/16 for an assault after he had grabbed the steering wheel of a coach/bus he was a passenger on and forced it to crash into the central barriers.

The witnesses describe his behaviour as being strange. He was charged and remanded by Northamptonshire Magistrates Court. The reason that bail was refused was for his own protection.

He arrived at HMP WOODHILL at approximately 14:30 on Saturday 10/12/16. He refused to engage with prison staff during the interview stage and notes state that there were no indications of self-harm.

At 07:15 hours 11/12/2016 he was seen in his cell by prison officers and appeared fine. At 08:05 11/12/2016 he was found hanging from a bed frame with a blanket as a noose in his cell, CPR was commenced and he was taken to Milton Keynes Hospital where his death was confirmed.","(1) The deceased had been arrested for dangerous driving when, on 9 December 2016, he tried to grab the steering wheel of a bus travelling on the M1 motorway forcing it to collide with the barriers in the roadworks. Whilst in police custody the deceased was behaving in a bizarre manner and was assessed by a medical practitioner at the custody centre. When eventually transferred to Woodhill Prison after appearing on a Saturday morning at Wellingborough Magistrates Court the warrant simply stated that the offence was “dangerous driving.” Which did not in any way give a true picture of the offence and very little information was provided to the prison as to his behaviour or mental state. The prison informed me that it would have been helpful for them to receive a copy of the deceased’s custody record that gave the full picture.

(2) When the deceased appeared before the magistrates his solicitor was informed that it was not possible on a Saturday morning for a mental health assessment to be conducted. The court did not attempt to contact the prison to inform the prison of the problems being experienced by him due to his mental illness. Consideration should have been given as to the most appropriate place for the deceased to be held or to receive a mental health assessment.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 September 2017. The conclusion following the inquest was that Mr. Bhim’s and Miss. Sutaria’s medical cause of death was:

1. a. Multiple traumatic injury.

The summary of the facts was:

At approximately 22.30 on 3 December 2015 the deceased were driver and passenger respectively in a BMW vehicle, registration number [REDACTED] travelling southbound along the A46 close to the junction with the A606 at Widmerpool. It was raining heavily. By reason of the presence of standing water in the vicinity of the railway bridge which passes over the A46 and a gulley identified as SBA 14 in a diagram dated 3 February 2016, the vehicle in which the deceased was travelling left the carriageway, passed through a gap in the vehicle restraint barrier and came to rest in Fairham Brook. The drain from gulley number SBA 14 was blocked and unable to cope with the volume of water generated by recent rainfall.
It is likely the deceased survived that collision and climbed from the vehicle to the verge alongside the A46.
Shortly after the deceased’s vehicle left the carriageway, a Citroen van, registration number [REDACTED], driven by [REDACTED] and travelling at approximately 65 m.p.h. came unsighted upon the standing water which caused [REDACTED] to lose control of the van. The van left the carriageway and slid along a section of vehicle restraint barrier passing over Fairham Brook.
In the course of the van’s uncontrollable slide along the barrier the deceased were struck and sustained fatal injuries. They were pronounced dead at the scene.

The conclusion was:

Road traffic collision",,"1. The drain SBA 14 was blocked and unable to cope with the volume of water generated by recent rainfall;
2. The vehicle restraint barrier at the location of the road traffic collision (Highways England’s location code being X-465224, Y-328926) was and is not continuous. Accordingly:
a. It failed to prevent the vehicle in which the deceased were travelling from leaving the carriageway; and
b. Resulted in [REDACTED] vehicle being able to mount the barrier passing over Fairham Brook.
c. The scene of the collision is in a natural ‘bowl’ and that, unless effectively drained, it is a point at which standing water will accumulate during and/or after heavy rainfall;
d. The gap in the vehicle restraint barrier (Highways England’s location code X-465224, Y-328926) at the entrance to the land owned and/or occupied by [REDACTED] (and registered at the Land Registry under title number NT514257) is a hazard to traffic in that it permits vehicles to pass unimpeded from the carriageway.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,<NA>,<NA>,Pedestrian

The weather conditions were poor, it was raining, very misty and foggy. The driver of the car, Mrs [REDACTED], turned left at the Roundswell roundabout off the A39 with the intention of heading towards the Cedars roundabout between Sticklepath and Bickington near Barnstaple. This route would have taken her across two further roundabouts before turning right at the Cedars roundabout. In the fog, [REDACTED] became disorientated and made one wrong turn. Once she found her way back to the road linking the Roundswell roundabout with the Cedars roundabout she then proceeded but instead of turning right at the Cedars roundabout she turned left at the roundabout immediately before the Cedars roundabout. Continuing down this road without turning left into a residential development the road is closed off by a wall with which [REDACTED] collided.

His death was referred to the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Coroner. After a post mortem, an investigation was opened on 18 August 2016 and an inquest opened on 6 December 2016. The inquest hearing took place on 2 June 2017 at Truro Municipal Buildings. The cause of death was established as 1a) Multiple injuries; 2) Diabetes; renal, hepatic and vascular disease.","Henry Prow was returning from a weekly routine medical appointment at Derriford Hospital on 12 August 2016 in his Vauxhall Insignia VRN [REDACTED]. He had multiple medical and physical disabilities which required him to drive an automatic car with assisted steering. He was driving along the A38 Dobwalls by-pass at around 66 mph when he failed to reduce his speed for unknown reasons on approaching the Twelvewoods Roundabout resulting in the car colliding with the kerb by the separation barrier at around 12.36 pm. As a result of this collision, the car left the ground and rotated about its longitudinal axis and then collided with the chevroned sharp deviation of route sign and posts on the roundabout. Mr Prow received fatal injuries from the collision and died at the scene. He was not wearing a seat belt or using the required assisted steering at the time of the collision. A medical event prior to the collision could not be excluded.","At the inquest concerns were raised by the police and a friend as to the criteria required by the DVLA and Department of Transport for the issuing and surrendering of driving licences and the terms and conditions for ensuring appropriate modification of drivers' vehicles.

Mr Prow had been a very fit and active man and worked as a training instructor in the Army for 3 years. As a result of his deteriorating poor health he lost his mobility and he was keen not to lose his driving licence which would reduce his independence. At inquest it was considered that the collision was possibly preceded by Mr Prow having a medical issue/event.

The DVLA appears to have limited mechanisms for drivers to be formally medically reviewed for the purpose of being medically fit to drive. In particular in cases where drivers have deteriorating health or fluctuating health (of which they may not have insight) as in the case of Mr Prow.

It is understood that at present the treating GP/doctors or the driver themselves have a duty to advise the DVLA of medical issues which can affect a person’s ability to drive. A driver’s voluntary surrender of a driving licence (especially in a rural area with little public transport) may have a serious detrimental effect on their health and social/employment situation making it an unrealistic expectation on the driver in many cases. There was concern that the driver’s GP/doctors could have a conflict of interests in such situations as they would have a duty to inform the DVLA of medical issues which could result in the surrender of the driving licence which could/would result in deterioration of the patient/doctor relationship, e.g. such as patients withholding significant medical information with their doctors for fear of losing their licence.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 24 August 2017.

The conclusion of the investigation was that Terence Ryan died as a consequence of injuries sustained in a road traffic collision where no anti-coagulation treatment was available to him following his self-discharge from hospital.","1. Terence Ryan (hereinafter referred to as “the deceased”) died at [REDACTED] on 14 November 2016.

2. In August 2014 the deceased had a right Deep Vein Thrombosis in his thigh and a Pulmonary Embolus. In April 2015 the deceased had a further investigation for Deep Vein Thrombosis and it was not clear if this related to his previous Deep Vein Thrombosis or if this was a new event but he was commenced on Dalteparin injections as an anticoagulant for three months.

3. Dalteparin was subsequently changed to Rivaroxaban but this caused him to collapse and the Rivaroxaban was stopped and the Dalteparin injections restarted.

4. On 15 July 2016 the deceased attended the Deep Vein Thrombosis Clinic when a Consultant prescribed Edoxaban 60mg per day for long term anticoagulation on weekly repeat prescriptions to be issued by the General Practitioner. However when the Clinic letter was received by the General Practitioner from the Consultant, the prescription of Edoxaban was not added to the deceased’s repeat prescriptions.

The deceased had further consultations with the General Practitioner on 10 August 2016, 30 September 2016 and 14 October 2016 and during that time he had complained about pain and swelling in the leg and a repeat prescription for his medication had been issued. However, the anticoagulation was not discussed at the appointments and the repeat prescriptions did not include Edoxaban. Accordingly, the deceased did not receive Edoxaban or any other anticoagulation medication from 15 July 2016, when the Consultant issued a prescription, until the date of his admission to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wigan on 3 November 2016.

The General Practitioner giving evidence at the Inquest confirmed that, when the Clinic letter relating to the prescription of Edoxaban had been received by the Surgery, the prescription had not been added to Mr Ryan’s repeat prescriptions, as it should have been, and the anticoagulation had not been considered at subsequent appointments.

5. On 3 November 2016 the deceased was in collision with a motor vehicle whilst crossing Atherleigh Way, Leigh at the junction with Kirkhall Lane, Leigh. He sustained a tibia fracture to the left leg and he was taken to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wigan, where the fracture was treated conservatively with a plaster cast and splint and he was admitted to the Hospital for physiotherapy and non-weight bearing non-operative treatment.

6. In Hospital he was prescribed Dalteparin as prophylactic anticoagulation, which was to be continued for two weeks from the time of his admission.

7. On 10 November 2016 the deceased discharged himself from the Hospital against medical advice and he left the Hospital without any anticoagulation medication. The Dalteparin prescribed in the Hospital was not given to him because he walked out of the Hospital without waiting for a discharge notice and medication. Furthermore the Edoxaban, prescribed by a Consultant on 15 July 2016, had not been included on the repeat prescriptions by the General Practitioner.

8. On 10 November 2016 at 12:30 hours a Doctor had a bleep from the Ward where the deceased was receiving treatment and the Doctor was informed that the deceased wanted to discharge himself immediately. The Doctor met the deceased and tried to establish the reason for his self-discharge and the Doctor discussed the treatment and the mobilisation plan with the deceased. The Doctor explained the need for the deceased to stay in Hospital, particularly in view of the previous history of Deep Vein Thrombosis. The deceased agreed to stay in the Hospital but at 13:00 hours on the same day the Doctor received another call from the Ward stating that the deceased had decided to discharge himself from the Ward, against medical advice, and he had walked off the Ward and left the Hospital.

The Doctor was concerned that the deceased had left the Hospital and he asked a Nurse in charge of the Ward as to the Hospital protocol when a patient self-discharges against medical advice. The Doctor was told by the Nurse that there was no protocol and he did not need to take any further action.

9. Following the deceased’s self-discharge from the Hospital on 10 November 2016 there is no record of any contact with the General Practitioner and no record of any further contact with the Hospital.

10. On 14 November 2016 he was found in a collapsed and unresponsive condition at his home address at [REDACTED] Leigh when he was diagnosed as having died.","1. During the Inquest evidence was heard that:

i. On 15 July 2016 a Consultant prescribed Edoxaban 60mg per day for long term anticoagulation treatment to be collected by the deceased on a weekly basis by repeat prescription issued by the General Practitioner and the Consultant sent a letter to the General Practitioner to confirm that plan of treatment. The repeat prescription for Edoxaban was not put on the deceased’s repeat prescriptions by the General Practitioner and the deceased did not receive Edoxaban for administration after 22 July 2016 and he would not have had a supply of Edoxaban following his self-discharge from the Hospital on 10 November 2016.

The General Practitioner gave evidence that the Surgery had undertaken a “Significant Event Analysis” as to how the Edoxaban prescription had been missed and the investigation resulted in the following recommendations within the Surgery to prevent a recurrence:

a. GP to review “active problems” on the computer system when any patient comes in, in order to ensure patient is on the appropriate treatment.

b. In respect of discharge letters directing new medication – the letter will be sent on a task to a prescription clerk, who will add the new medication and issue a month’s supply. If necessary (depending on the type of medication involved) the task will include sending a request to the patient to see the GP for review in a month’s time.

However, the General Practitioner confirmed that the above recommendations had not been included in any formal documented protocol and I was not satisfied that there was to be a note on a patient’s record to alert a Doctor to a new medication subject to repeat prescription, bearing in mind that the deceased had seen a General Practitioner on 13 September 2016, 30 September 2016 and 14 October 2016 without the omission being checked.

ii. The evidence at the Inquest revealed that the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust does not have a protocol with regard to patients who self-discharge from the Hospital, particularly where they may be receiving necessary medication in the form of anticoagulation treatment. At the Inquest the deceased was identified as a vulnerable patient and the absence of a protocol is even more important in relation to a vulnerable patient.

There is no protocol to contact the Police, General Practitioner, Family or Social Services to bring it to their attention that a patient has self-discharged so that they become aware and they can make contact with the patient following his discharge to ensure that he has appropriate support and necessary medication.

2. I request the Senior Partner of the Grasmere Surgery, Leigh Health Centre, The Avenue, Leigh, to conduct a review of the documented protocols and systems relating to the recording of repeat prescriptions, particularly where repeat prescriptions are requested by a Consultant or a Health Professional outside the Surgery. The review should consider the training of Health Professionals, including Doctors, and check systems to ensure that any request for repeat prescription is recorded and within the knowledge of a Doctor treating a patient.

Cheema,Cumbria,Highways Department Cumbria County Council,On 20/04/2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jeffrey William Matthews born 19 April 1988. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest 31 August 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased Jeffrey William Matthews died as a result of a road traffic collision.,"On 26 March 2017 at about 13.35 hours, the deceased had been riding his motorcycle in a north westerly direction along the C1021 heading towards Great Orton village from the A595, when he collided with the offside of a Nissan Juke travelling in a north easterly direction towards Carlisle along the C2051. The deceased suffered fatal injuries as a result of the collision and was pronounced life extinct at the scene at 14.19 hours.","The C1021 is a minor country road that runs from the A595 at Orton Grange Roundabout in a north westerly direction and terminates when it joins the C2051 at Great Orton village. The road is generally unmarked and just wide enough for two vehicles to pass in opposite directions. The statutory speed limit is 60 mph. Approximately 220 metres prior to the scene of the collision on the C1021, is a left hand bend as you approach from the A595. The bend travels through an angle of approximately 16 degrees before the road straightens on the approach to the crossroads.

The C1021 is straight for approximately 196 metres from the bend to the crossroad and continues straight beyond the crossroads for approximately 159 metres before entering another left hand bend. The police collision investigation report dated 14 August 2017 identifies at paragraph 4.4 that at this point, the presence of the crossroad junction is not obvious to any approaching vehicle. The height of the roadside hedgerows and their close proximity cause a tunnel effect and as such obscure any sign of the crossroads. It is also noted that the presence of the ‘Give Way’ sign at the crossroad junction is lost in the background and therefore not obviously visible to approaching drivers from a distance.

Cumbria County Council is responsible for implementing measures on the county highway network that aim to reduce casualties and the risk of collisions. The C2051 Great Orton Crossroad was previously identified as having a sufficiently serious collision record during the period 1 October 2012 up to 30 September 2015. Capita were commissioned to carry out an independent investigation and inspection.

The finding in the police investigation report at paragraph 4.4 as set out above was not identified by Capita.

Evidence was heard at the inquest that the recommendations made by Capita in their report dated May 2016 were not implemented due to a lack of resources. The recommendations were;

1. The application of high friction surfacing on the north and southbound approaches
2. Vegetation trimming – cutting back vegetation to the south-east, north-east and north-west quadrant verge areas
3. Additional road markings on C1021 junction approaches – provide ‘SLOW’ markings on red patch on the C1021 approaches, adjacent to warning signs.

(1) The current warning signage on approach to the junction from a north westerly direction is inadequate.
(2) The height of the roadside hedgerows and their close proximity causes a tunnel effect obscuring any sign of the crossroads restricting visibility.
(3) Modifications to the junction on approach as recommended by Capita should be re-considered to minimise the risk of incidents and death in the future.",False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,28,Male,Other

Sigee,Greater Manchester North,"The Chief Executive, Bury MBC; The Secretary of State for Transport","On 2 April 2016 the senior coroner for the coroner area of Greater Manchester North commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Roger Hamer, aged 83 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 August 2017.

The conclusion of the inquest was that the medical cause of Mr Hamer’s death was (1A) traumatic brain injury and (2) multiple fractures.

The jury gave a narrative verdict in which they found that Mr Hamer had probably been caused to fall from his bicycle and to suffer the injuries from which he died by a pothole in the carriageway (“the Pothole”).","On 5 March 2016 Mr Hamer fell from his bicycle on Bury New Road, Ramsbottom, suffering a traumatic brain injury and multiple fractures. He was conveyed to hospital where despite maximal treatment he died from these injuries on 2 April 2016.","(1) When he inspected the carriageway in January 2016 and February 2016 the highway inspector did not photograph, measure and/or record any details as to the condition of the carriageway where the pothole developed despite it having started to deteriorate, wear and crack by October 2015.

This prevented the Highway Authority from effectively assessing the rate of deterioration of this part of the carriageway which may have helped to inform it as to the need for earlier repair.

Also, the lack of images and/or measurements of the pothole as at the date of the inspections restricted the Highway Authority’s ability to effectively supervise and monitor the highway inspector and it hindered the jury’s ability to make more detailed findings as to the circumstances of Mr Hamer’s death.

(2) The jury recorded its concern as to the lack of paint markings around the potholes which may have highlighted their presence to Mr Hamer thereby enabling him to avoid them.

(3) The Highway Authority does not have a procedure with a duty of candour for the effective investigation of, and learning lessons from, significant incidents comparable to those adopted by other public bodies (for example within the National Health Service).

(4) The Highway Authority is in the process of adopting a new procedure for highway management (“the New Procedure”), apparently based upon Well-Managed Highway Infrastructure: a Code of Practice published by the Department for Transport in October 2016.

With regards to defects in the carriageway, the Highway Authority’s current procedure for highway management has an intervention level of 40mm so that any defect which is found to be 40mm or greater is repaired.

Under the New Procedure 40mm will be redefined as the “investigation level”, so that once a carriageway defect is greater than 40mm a highway inspector will investigate it and consider whether a repair is needed.

If 40mm is specified in the New Procedure as the minimum threshold for investigation then defects which measure less than 40mm may not be investigated and defects of 40mm or above may not be repaired.

Whilst I was informed that highway inspectors have a discretion under both the current and new procedures to repair defects which do not meet the intervention or investigation criteria the jury noted inconsistencies in the application of the current procedure and I consider that the New Procedure will increase the risk of future deaths, in particular to cyclists.",False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,83,Male,Cyclist

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15.8.2017. The conclusion of the inquest was:

The deceased was an elderly pedestrian crossing a dual carriageway at an uncontrolled pedestrian crossing point when he was struck by a vehicle which failed to stop at the scene.","The deceased was 90 years of age. He mobilised well but was slow when walking and needed to turn his upper body when looking left or right due to neuralgia. On 25 November 2016 he had been to visit family and was returning home on the bus. At about 17.15 hours he alighted from the bus at the bus stop near to the Miller and Carter Public House on the A449 Stourbridge Road, Penn. He had with him a shopping trolley which he used as a walking aid and a walking stick. He had started to cross over the two lane dual carriageway at an uncontrolled pedestrian crossing point. He was probably at a point in the centre of the two lane carriageway when he was struck by a Volkswagen Scirocco motor vehicle registered number PJ59 WFO which was travelling along the A449 in the offside lane approaching from his right and from the general direction of Wolverhampton. This vehicle was overtaking other vehicles which were travelling in the nearside lane which may have obstructed the driver's view of the deceased. The driver of the vehicle failed to stop at the scene. There is a pedestrian crossing warning sign at the approach to the crossing. The speed limit at the scene of the collision is 60 mph. The estimated speed of the vehicle involved was 75-85 mph. It was dark but the road was well illuminated. The deceased was wearing non-reflective clothing. The weather was dry.","(1) The deceased had alighted from a bus and was crossing the very busy A449 dual carriageway at an uncontrolled pedestrian crossing point. The crossing is:

1. On a bend
2. Obscured by a brick wall in the centre of the carriageway.
3. The speed limit changes from 40 mph to 60 mph 260 m prior to the crossing.
4. Uncontrolled.
5. Adjacent or very near to a public house, an elderly care home, a housing estate, a bus layby and a road junction.

In this case the view of the pedestrian was obscured by vehicles travelling in the nearside lane. The deceased was elderly, another young female passenger had also alighted from the bus and crossed the road at the same point. She needed to hurry to avoid the approaching vehicles.

Caller,London Inner West,TFL; Principal Lawyer TfL Legal,"On the 17 February 2017 Dr Fiona Wilcox, HM Senior Coroner, for the Coroner Area Inner London West submitted a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 which was sent subsequent to preliminary evidence taken by the Senior Coroner at a Pre-inquest Review touching the death of Milan Dokic on 14 February 2017

Subsequent to the aforementioned Pre Inquest Review the Inquest took place on 11 July 2017

the view of the evidence based upon CCTV recordings and the view of the collision investigator was that Mr Dokic was travelling east on a motorcycle and overtaking a van from the inside on Battersea Park Road on the 1 March 2016 in wet conditions, when he lost control of his vehicle when he drove onto the blue cycle lane just past the pedestrian crossing opposite the junction with Forfar Road. The CCTV clearly shows the motorcycle losing grip and sliding along the road. Sadly, Mr Dokic came off, and hit a bollard sustaining injuries that led to his death at the scene.

At the Inquest I stated in my summing up, that the death was caused by a combination of factors including the manoeuvre Mr Dokic made from the main highway into Cycle Super Highway 8 (""CSH8"") and the speed he was travelling at the time and the lack of grip on the blue area on the CSH8 set at 56.5 being below the recommended level of 60 set for the blue area on CSH8","The evidence was that the blue cycle lane of the CSH8 at the point where he came off when later tested by the collision investigator offers a much lower grip than the conventional road surface with a skid resistance value of 56.5 compared to the road surface of 77.05 and the CSH8 before the pedestrian crossing an even higher skid resistance value of 89.85.

I understand that some cyclists have raised concerns that the CSH8 appears in places to have lower grip than other areas of road surface.

The collision investigator was also concerned that Battersea Park Road at the junction with Forfar Road is an area in which turning manoeuvres are frequent and so it may be an area of particular danger to vulnerable road users prone to slip such as motorcyclists and cyclists.","1. There is an inadequate system of determining grip levels on CSH8 and on other Cycle Super Highways and on other roads in London.

2. There has been a failure to monitor grip values on Cycle Super Highways in London.

3. Urgent research needs to be carried out on having a clear scientific way of determining grip values which can be applied to roadways in London.

4. Urgent research should be carried out into the adverse effects of having adjacent areas of road with very different grip values and, subject to such research, remedial response is needed once that research has been carried out.",False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Other

The medical cause of death was 1a ruptured right atrium; 1b fractured thoracic spine.,"On 24 April 2016, Philip James Clayton was a passenger in a Zcar Mini. The vehicle had been purchased earlier that day in a private sale by a member of Philip Clayton's family. The car had some defects and would not have passed an MOT.

Philip James Clayton died on 24 April 2016 at Buxton Road, High Lane, Stockport.","The vehicle in question was a Z car which is a type of vehicle built using a kit and to which a high powered engine is fitted. There are a number of sellers of such vehicles in the country. None of these sellers have to provide any form of driving course in the use of such vehicles before they are sold. These vehicles once built have to undergo a rigorous test to comply with Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency under the Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA). This test is a lot more involved than a normal MOT and checks things from the conformity of switches to the actual construction of the vehicle body and everything in between. Each item fitted to the vehicle is checked to ensure it conforms to the current legislation, if the vehicle passed the IVA then it is assigned a registration number more often than not a “Q” plate. However once this designation has been given it appears that the vehicles do not undergo such rigorous testing on a regular basis.

In addition, the driver of the vehicle was relatively inexperienced and had very limited experience of driving vehicles such as the one involved in this case. The current legislation allows a person to drive any modified or powerful vehicle once they have passed a normal driving test within the UK.

Ridley,Wiltshire and Swindon,Head of Highways & Transport Swindon Borough Council,"On the 1 March 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nina MAGGS and an Inquest into her death was opened on the 8 March 2017. On the 19 July 2017 I concluded Nina’s Inquest. I found that the medical cause of death was 1a) Multiple Traumatic Injuries and under 1b) Road Traffic Collision. In box 3 of the Record of Inquest I recorded how, when and where Nina came by her death the following:-

Nina died from multiple traumatic injuries at the scene when she was struck by an Iveco road sweeper (left hand drive) travelling slowly along Hyde Road at the junction with Ermin Street, Kingsdown Road and Beechcroft Road in Swindon. Nina was attempting to cross the road close to a dedicated pedestrian crossing heading northeast from Beechcroft Road at about 1623 on 23 February 2017. It is more likely than not that Nina had not appreciated that the driver was sat on the nearside of the vehicle and due to the presence of the A pillar and her height, Nina’s actions went unnoticed by the driver even when Nina was in front of the vehicle due to the height of Nina relative to the windscreen.

Consistent with what I recorded elsewhere on the record of Inquest as a conclusion I recorded – Road Traffic Collision",,"The general safety of pedestrians crossing this junction with Ermin Street, Kingsdown Road and Beechcroft Road in Swindon.

During the course of the inquest I was satisfied that the reason Nina was not using the designated location pedestrian crossing across Hyde Road was due to the fact that in crossing the road she would not have had a clear view of approaching vehicles up Beechcroft Road which could be turning left into Hyde Road. It concerns me that whilst modifications had been carried out to the road to allow pedestrians to cross the road including those for example using disability scooters having regard to the lowering of the pavements they do so at significant risk of harm and even death. Whilst the junction is controlled by traffic lights there is no assistance given to pedestrians, such as a “green man”, an active sound indicating that it is safe to cross or vibrating module at the side of the road that can be sensed by somebody with a visual and hearing impairment. In fact I heard evidence during the course of the hearing that whilst there was a period of time when all the lights at the junction were red this lasted a matter of 4 seconds which is totally insufficient in my view in giving a pedestrian and in particular one that may have a physical impairment time to safely cross any of the roads at the junction.

An illuminated advertising board positioned close to the kerb obstructed Jack’s view of the road and the car driver’s view of the pavement.

Loxton,Surrey,"Gareth Llewellyn, Chief Executive, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency; The Rt Hon John Hayes, Minister of State for Transport, Department of Transport; [REDACTED], Managing Director, Honda UK Manufacturing Limited",The inquest into the death of Raymond Dathan Berry was opened on 6 January 2016. A pre-inquest review took place on 14 October 2016 and the inquest was concluded on 3 April 2017.,"Raymond Berry was travelling home from visiting relatives shortly before midnight on 25 December 2015 in a Honda Jazz car driven by his wife, along the B311 Red Road. The car drove onto the roundabout at the junction with the A322 Guildford Road and crashed into a tree. Mr Berry was not wearing a seatbelt at the point of collision and sustained serious head and chest injuries and died at the scene early on 26 December 2015. [REDACTED] suffered serious injuries and has no recollection of the event.
Airbags in the vehicle were not deployed. Honda UK examined the vehicle having been contacted by police who queried the fact the airbags had not deployed and gave evidence that parameters had not been met to activate the Supplementary Restraint System. Sensors at the front of the car were located either side of the front bumper, below the headlights. The collision with the tree had occurred at the centre of the front of the car and Honda gave evidence the crumple zone in this area absorbed much of the impact meaning the rate of deceleration was not sufficient to trigger the airbags to deploy. It was not possible to calculate the speed at which the car had been travelling at the point of impact but the police collision investigation officer estimated this to be around 30 miles per hour. No faults were found with the vehicle.","- The parameters required to activate the Supplementary Restraint System may require adjusting or amendment to activate airbags in cases where a collision occurs away from the vicinity of the sensors, for example to the front centre of the vehicle

Dorries,Yorkshire West Western,"The Chief Executive, Sheffield City Council; The Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police; The Chief Executive, Amey PLC; The Chief Executive, Yorkshire Water PLC","In December 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Sean Craig Salvin. The investigation concluded following an inquest in February 2016 where the narrative conclusion set out that:
Sean Craig Salvin died on 30 December 2015 in consequence of severe injuries sustained when his car left the road in the area of Sheffield known as Woolley Wood Bottom. The road was heavily flooded at the time (a period of very heavy rainfall) primarily because of a long standing under-capacity of the sewers, albeit possibly with more recent blockages. Because of failures to collect, share and collate information, opportunities had been missed during the month of December 2015 for authorities to recognise that there was an increasing problem of flooding at that location. Thus no remedial measures were taken which could have avoided the incident in which Mr Salvin lost his life.","The circumstances of the death are set out in the narrative conclusion shown above. In short, the evidence showed that whilst individual authorities had taken some actions on some issues that they became aware of there was a lack of co-ordination in the collection and collation of information between those authorities. This meant that the wider picture of an increasing problem at the location was never fully appreciated.","a) The evidence showed that there was insufficient system for the collation and sharing of information to assure that each of the authorities was aware of potentially important incidents. If national guidelines were being followed, as was stated, then the evidence suggests that those guidelines are themselves deficient.
b) In particular, such sharing of information as there was did not always fully or even properly identify the location concerned. The inquest showed that it was not difficult to identify that a number of incidents had occurred in the same place prior to the fatal collision.
c) Further, the system did not apparently require ‘damage only’ incidents to be shared. It is appreciated that the sharing of minor incidents could easily become burdensome but the case of [REDACTED] (August 2015) which was recorded as ‘damage only’ was actually a serious matter indicating that greater care is needed in the collection/sharing of information and subsequent categorisation.
d) [REDACTED] had suffered unpleasant injuries including a fracture to his lower back. Although this became known to the South Yorkshire Police, no adjustment was made. Amey advised the court that they had not been made aware of this incident.
e) The risk assessment of this location was also of concern to the inquest, both in respect of prioritisation of funding for major work and in terms of the recognition of the degree of risk. This was a location where traffic might be expected to be travelling comparatively quickly with the major hazard of trees immediately adjoining the carriageway. The emergence of a propensity to flood was a most important addition to the risk calculation.
f) Whilst it is recognised that steps have been taken which are believed to remove or significantly reduce future risk at this location, the authorities may wish to consider continued close monitoring until they can be sure that this is the case.
g) Witnesses reported the street lighting as ‘adequate’ and a site inspection did not suggest otherwise. However, the growth of trees and the development of leaves in spring and summer will inevitably reduce the lighting available on the road unless proper (and probably substantial) trimming takes place. The court was told that this is a recognised and regular maintenance issue but a concern would arise if this was reduced for any reason such as future budgetary constraints.
h) Finally, and not a matter of risk to the public, the court noted that a timing submitted by Messrs Amey was significantly different to a time provided by South Yorkshire Police which the court accepted as accurate. It was explained that the timing came from a computer and there is no reason to suggest that it was put forward in anything other than good faith. The matter became irrelevant to the inquest – but that might not always be the case and Amey may wish to review the technical aspects of the timing to prevent future difficulties.",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

I concluded the investigation by way of a one day inquest on 2 March 2017.

I concluded that death was due to road traffic collision.","On the 14th day of May 2016, at approximately 10:30am, Mr Langford was walking along Albert Road, Caversham, Berkshire, with his wife.

Albert Road is a residential road with two lanes, one in either direction, and is subject to a statutory speed limit of 30mph.

There are a number of roads leading off Albert Road, one of which is Highmoor Road.

The junction of Highmoor Road with Albert Road is marked by a stop sign, solid white lines and a section of red tarmac. The junction has restricted visibility due to houses on either side, fences and trees.

Vehicle 1 was driving along Albert Road, in the direction of Mr Langford. Vehicle 1 was driving within the speed limit.

Vehicle 2 approached the junction with Albert Road from Highmoor Road. Vehicle 2 started to pull out of the junction and collided with vehicle 1, causing it to veer off course.

Vehicle 1 crossed the opposite carriageway, mounted the pavement and collided with Mr Langford, knocking him into the road. He sustained a non-survivable head injury and died the same day.","During the inquest, the court heard evidence from [REDACTED] Forensic Collision Investigator for Thames Valley Police. He attended the scene shortly after the collision and examined the junction. His evidence was that visibility at the junction is restricted, particularly when looking to the right, due to a house with a large fence and trees. The following four important points were elicited during the inquest:

(1) a vehicle stopped at the stop line on Highmoor Road is first able to see the front offside corner of a vehicle travelling north along Albert Road at a distance of about 35 metres;

(2) a vehicle stopped at the stop line on Highmoor Road is first able to see the full width of the front of a vehicle travelling north along Albert Road at a distance of about 24 metres;

(3) if a vehicle is travelling at 30mph along Albert Road, it will take only 2.6 seconds from being completely out of view of drivers on Highmoor Road to reaching the junction. It will take only 1.8 seconds from the time that the front of the vehicle is visible until it reaches the junction;

(4) given a typical rate of acceleration, it is not possible for a ‘normal’ driver in a ‘normal’ car to pull safely out of Highmoor Road junction even when Albert Road appears to be clear. The only way to negotiate the junction safely is to edge forward, maintaining a constant look-out.

Mr Henderson was of the opinion that the junction could be improved by bringing it forward, thereby increasing visibility along Albert Road, and reducing the likelihood of further collisions.",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Pedestrian

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 January 2017. The conclusion of the inquest was that the medical cause of death was 1(a) traumatic rupture of thoracic aorta. Multiple rib fractures. Fractured pelvis and the short-form conclusion was that the death was due a ‘road traffic collision’.,"The circumstances of Mrs. Jones’ death was that on 5 September 2016 she was driving her Ford Tourneo (Registration [REDACTED]) along Branch Road, Hinton Charterhouse in the direction of the A36. She was alone in the car at the time. Her daughter was driving the car ahead with two other occupants. At around 13:24 hours Mrs. Jones was emerging from the Branch Road junction on to the A36 with the intention of turning right (south east). Her daughter had just performed the same manoeuvre. As she commenced the right turn on to the A36 a collision occurred between her vehicle and a Scania R450 44 tonne articulated lorry travelling north, the driver of the lorry being unable to avoid the collision.

As a result of the collision Mrs. Jones received serious injuries from which she died at the scene. She was pronounced dead at 14:20 hours. The driver of the lorry was physically uninjured.

During the Inquest I heard evidence from witnesses to the collision as well as from [REDACTED] of the Collision Investigation Unit, Avon & Somerset Constabulary who conducted the collision investigation. In evidence I heard that the weather at the time of collision was dry, overcast with good visibility. The carriageway surface was mostly dry. Junction markings were worn but visible. The high friction coating of the A36 in the vicinity of the junction was worn in places. I heard evidence that the speed of the Scania R450 immediately before the collision was approximately 35 mph. The speed limit on the carriageway at the scene of the collision is 60 mph and 50 mph for large goods vehicles.

The Ford Tourneo and the Scania R450 were both examined by specialist vehicle examiners of the Collision Investigation Unit who reported that there were no defects in either vehicle which would have caused or contributed to the collision. A medical episode, alcohol and mobile phone use by either driver were not factors in the collision.

During the Inquest I heard evidence that opposite the junction were unauthorised road side traders making and selling sizeable carved wooden objects. In addition I heard that Mrs. Jones, who was following her daughter, was anxious not to lose sight of her daughter as she was unsure of the route. This anxiousness on the part of Mrs. Jones and the possible momentary distraction due to the traders opposite the junction I found to be contributory factors to the collision.

During the course of the Inquest I heard evidence from [REDACTED] that there had been a number of road traffic collisions at this junction involving vehicles emerging from Branch Road, with both the speed of vehicles and traffic density being contributory factors.

Ormond-Walshe,London Inner South,[REDACTED] Head of Legal Department London Borough of Southwark; [REDACTED] Managing Director Service Transport Transport for London,On 03/06/2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Esther Hartsilver. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16/2/2017. The conclusion of the inquest was that she died of multiple injuries in a road traffic collision.,"Esther Hartsilver died having been involved in a road traffic collision on her way to work on 28 May 2015. She was cycling to King's College Hospital where she worked as a physiotherapist. She was cycling along Denmark Hill. When she got to the junction of Denmark Hill with Orpheus Street she was cycling in the left hand (bus) lane. I will call this Lane 1. There was one further lane in the same direction. This was Lane 2. Denmark Hill forms part of the A215.

An HGV lorry was being driven in Lane 2. This lorry was due to turn left at the junction, turning into Orpheus Street. Just before the junction there is a pedestrian crossing with no phased traffic lighting. It is pedestrian controlled.

Lane 2 traffic was busy with traffic. The bus lane was more free. At 07:58 hours, as the lorry began to turn left, it came into collision with Miss Hartsilver's bicycle. It is not known whether Miss Hartsilver was using a route to work that day which involved her planning to turn left into Orpheus Street or cycling straight ahead along Denmark Hill.

The HGV lorry's indicator was on before it began its turn. Tragically, Miss Hartsilver's bicycle was caught by the lorry when the lorry turned into her lane and she was very seriously injured in the collision. She was seen by paramedics and the HEMS team and taken to King's College Hospital. Despite quite extraordinary efforts of her colleagues at King's College Hospital, she could not be saved and died there approximately six hours after her arrival. She was pronounced dead at 15:00 hours.","This report concerns the design of the junction of Denmark Hill with Orpheus Street (""the junction"").

The junction predisposes itself to the very risk materialising that sadly caused Miss Hartsilver's death. Traffic wishing to turn left may, at the moment, turn left from lane 2. This means that they cross a lane of traffic that may well be travelling straight ahead. Miss Hartsilver was an experienced London cyclist and the HGV driver an experienced driver also. It is the junction that is unusual.

It may not be unusual for a lorry turning into a side road to have to cross a bus lane. This junction can be distinguished from this, however. This is a more major junction than it appears. It is major because it feeds all the traffic that would have wanted to turn right as well as left, from a very busy road into what is effectively a side road. Further, it has a pedestrian crossing just before it. This means that although there is an early sign warning traffic of the banned right turn and to turn left instead, there are mandatory zig-zag lines on the road leading up to the junction and therefore there is no signage on the road surface warning any user of the potential for conflict.

The red coloured road surface that is present in the bus lane goes across this junction and will make vehicles think it is still a bus lane. Officially, the bus lane stops because the zig-zags take over as there is a pedestrian crossing present immediately before the turning on the left.

I accept that changing the layout of the junction requires experts to consider the safety of not just cyclists - of other road users and pedestrians too. The problems also must not be moved to another geographical location. The road, also, is 'what it is' - a relatively narrow road for the amount of traffic it serves. I fully appreciate the difficulties and challenges in catering for the huge amount of traffic whilst keeping safety as a high priority.

This is a complex matter and different risks must be weighed up very carefully. There are a large number of buses flowing at this junction. There are 80 buses in each direction every hour. It is under consideration moving the pedestrian crossing further north.

I am told if the bus lane were to end earlier there would still be a risk with larger vehicles needing to swing into lane 2, from lane 1, in turning the corner. It would not reduce the risk to zero. I understand all that. If I was cycling in that bus lane, even having seen the sign saying that there is a left turn for those wanting to turn right ahead, I would not be reminded of the risk of vehicles turning by anything in the road layout. There is also a significant amount of traffic turning across a bus lane.

[REDACTED] says that she saw a number of near misses when she visited the scene soon after the incident. She explains a near miss would be where a cyclist, for instance, would have to stop or slow to avoid a collision with traffic turning.

I am concerned that [REDACTED] says that there have been 18 collisions (reportable collision involving personal injury) in 5 years ending 6 2016. Involved were 7 motorcyclists, 7 pedestrians, 4 cyclists and one involving two cars.

This junction essentially comes under the shared care of both Transport for London (""TfL"") and the London Borough of Southwark. They both have different functions and duties but it would take both working together to agree a change to the design.

As this case tragically shows, cyclists are at high risk of severe injury and death if they come into collision with other road users. I write this report to ask that the experts in TfL and the London Borough of Southwark come together (with the assistance of the police) to explore what can be done to reduce the risk to all vulnerable road users at this junction.

Since 2011 there has been an application in place to improve Camberwell and in particular two large junctions, and within this proposal the Orpheus road junction is included. My understanding of that proposal is that there are still fairly major decisions to be made about, for instance, whether it would be beneficial or not to allow traffic travelling in the direction Miss Hartsilver was travelling to turn right or whether the current system of traffic turning left stays.

The family think that changes have been put into place in the junction, as a temporary measure. They have not. It has already been decided by the London Borough of Southwark not to put in temporary measures in the junction as it was judged that such measures would not minimise risk to vulnerable road users such as cyclists.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Female,Cyclist

How, when and where and in what circumstances the deceased came by her death:

The preliminary view of the evidence based upon CCTV recordings and the view of the collision investigator was that Mr Dokic was travelling east on a motorcycle and overtaking a van from the inside on Battersea Park Road on the 1 March 2016 in wet conditions, when he lost control of his vehicle when he drove onto the blue cycle lane just past the pedestrian crossing opposite the junction with Forfar Road. The CCTV clearly shows the motorcycle losing grip and sliding along the road. Sadly, Mr Dokic came off, and hit a bollard sustaining injuries that led to his death at the scene.

Conclusion as to the death

No conclusions have yet been reached as the inquest has not been heard.","The preliminary evidence was that the blue cycle lane of the cycle super-highway (CSH) at the point where he came off when later tested by the collision investigator offers a much lower grip than the conventional road surface with a skid resistance value of 56.3 compared to the road surface of 77.05 and the CSH before the pedestrian crossing an even higher skid resistance value of 89.85.

I understood that some cyclists have raised concerns that the CSH appears in places to have lower grip than other areas of road surface.

I am also due to hear evidence in another death in slightly different circumstances than this of Mr Dokic where low grip on the CSH may also have played a part. This death also occurred in Battersea.

The collision investigator was also concerned that Battersea Park Road at the junction with Forfar Road is an area in which turning manoeuvres are frequent and so it may be area of particular danger to vulnerable road users prone to slip such as motorcyclists and cyclists.","1. That the use of the road surface with reduced grip on the CSH compared to the usual road surface represents a hazard to road users making it more likely that they will lose control of their vehicles.
2. That the surface of the CSH with reduced grip may be widespread and as such other dangerous areas may exist.
3. That TfL should therefore undertake an urgent review of all areas treated with such road surface and replace it with the higher grip surface.
4. That the CSH should all have increased rather than reduced grip compared to the ordinary road surface since cyclists are vulnerable road users.

Smith,Greater Lincolnshire,The Department for Transport,"On 13 July 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Robert Arnold Dearing, aged 49. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 July 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Dearing died as a result of a road traffic collision, the medical cause of death being: 1a. Head injury","On 3 July 2015 at approximately 08:10 am Mr Dearing was riding his pedal cycle along the C420 road, known locally as Sand Lane, Barkston, Grantham, Lincolnshire.

He had almost reached the Sand Lane Railway Bridge, which carries the railway line across Sand Lane, the road passing under the bridge for a distance of approximately 20 metres.

The weather was bright and sunny, the sun being ahead of Mr Dearing, and slightly to his left hand side.

The immediate approach to the bridge had substantial hedges and mature trees which overhung the carriageway, causing substantial shadows. The area of the road beneath the bridge was in deep shadow.

Mr Dearing was wearing dark coloured clothing.

Mr Dearing was struck from the rear by a motor car being driven in the same direction of travel. The driver failed to see Mr Dearing prior to impact.

I received evidence that the driver offered by way of explanation for her failure to see Mr Dearing, that she had been distracted by the sun shining between her rear view mirror and sun visor, and also that he had been hidden in the shadows which were accentuated by the sudden change from bright sunlight to deep shade. At the time of the collision the driver was using a non-standard anti-glare visor fitted to the internal visor.","(I) I received evidence that an examination of the motor car involved in this collision revealed that at the time of the collision it was fitted with a non-standard “Sunblaster” anti-glare sun visor which had been clipped onto the standard internal fitted visor.

(II) The additional visor measured approximately 30cm x 10cm when folded. It was of bi-fold design, which allowed it to be opened down, to measure 30cm x 20cm. It was possible for the visor to be used with either one, or both sections of the visor in use, i.e. either single or double thickness.

(III) At the time of the collision the driver had been using the visor folded, so that it was being used in “double thickness” mode.

(IV) I received evidence that whilst there is specific legislation governing the light transmission qualities of vehicle windscreen glass, that the legislation does not currently extend to such devices, which are unregulated. I received evidence that there is currently no British Standard certification for such items.

(V) I received evidence that there was a legal requirement that the vehicle windscreen should have a Visual Light Transmission (VLT) reading of not less than 75%.

(VI) I received evidence that an analysis of the anti-glare visor demonstrated that if used in single thickness mode, it had a VLT of between 17.5% and 22.1%. When used in double thickness mode, as in this case, the VLT readings were greatly reduced, to between 3.9% and 4.2%.

(VII) I received evidence that such results could be considered dangerous in that the driver’s vision of the road ahead may be considerably obscured. In addition I received evidence that, if used in single mode, the fold line between the two sections may fall across the driver’s eye-line and present a further impediment to the driver’s field of view.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,49,Male,Cyclist

Brown,Northumberland,"Yvonne Ormston, Chief Executive, NEAS NHS Foundation Trust; Chief Clinical Officer, NHS Northumberland Clinical Commissioning Group","On 30 January 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kyle William Lowes aged 16 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 August 2016 with the following narrative conclusion:-
‘Kyle William Lowes was riding his motor scooter at North Road, Berwick-upon-Tweed at approximately 10.00 p.m. on 30.01.15 when his motor scooter collided with a Vauxhall Astra motor vehicle being driven directly across Kyle’s path when turning right from the opposing carriageway. Emergency services were contacted at 10.02 p.m. by a witness to the collision. An ambulance crew was not called by ambulance control from the nearby Berwick ambulance station because they had been stood down for their meal break at 10.00 p.m. An alternative paramedic was directed from Wooler who attended at 10.28 p.m., followed very shortly after by the Berwick crew who had on request from the Wooler paramedic, agreed to come off their meal break. Despite determined attempts at resuscitation Kyle could not be revived and his death was pronounced at 10.56 p.m. by paramedic [REDACTED]. The forensic pathologist [REDACTED] found that the medical cause of Kyle’s death was due to a blunt head injury and gave his view as pathologist though not as a practising specialist who treats patients, that the severity of Kyle’s injuries and the distance from a major trauma hospital meant that it was unlikely the fatal outcome for Kyle would have been any different had the paramedics been able to arrive sooner.",The incident was reported to North East Ambulance Emergency Control Centre at 22:00 on 30.01.15. Two minutes earlier the Berwick paramedic team day shift had gone off duty because there are only two ambulance crews provided between 10:00 and 22:00 and one overnight crew operating ‘mid shift’ between 18:30 and 06:30 who were instructed to take their statutory meal break. They could not therefore be contacted by ambulance control. This resulted in a travelling time of 26 minutes to the incident from the nearest paramedic resource (Wooler) instead of 3 minutes from Berwick-upon-Tweed. The practical difficulties encountered with Kyle Lowes’ emergency attendance were that Kyle required urgent advanced life support for the restoration of his breathing and a period of 26 minutes while waiting for a first responder from Wooler might have affected his chances of survival.,"The new Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital now makes better provision for the County of Northumberland as a whole, but extends still further the long journey times for emergency care from Berwick-upon-Tweed, a sizeable border town, with a population which trebles throughout the tourist season because of its location as a holiday destination. By having only one paramedic crew after 22:00, if that crew is on a meal break, or as they regularly need to do, attend duties in another part of the County, risk is created to the population of Berwick-upon-Tweed by significant delays in attending life-threatening incidents after 22:00, as there was in Kyle’s case.

I was informed at the inquest that NEAS are introducing a scheme whereby paramedic crews will be asked at the start of each shift whether they are willing to be contacted for emergency calls during their meal breaks, which might go some way towards helping to resolve the concerns but does not provide any certainty while resting only on the goodwill and agreement of ambulance personnel concerned. This proposal for response to emergency calls during meal breaks would also not address the risk of delayed response times when the single Berwick ambulance crew after 22:00 is called upon for duties out of the area.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,16,Male,Other

Meadows,Manchester City,"Medical Director, North Manchester General Hospital; Medical Director, Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust","On 10 December 2014 I opened an investigation into the death of Nicholas Patrick Sullivan. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 August 2016.

The cause of death was found to be:
Ia Traumatic brain injury
Ib --
Ic --
II Schizophrenia

The conclusion of the inquest was:

Narrative conclusion: The deceased suffered from a chronic and enduring mental illness, namely paranoid schizophrenia, which was remitting and relapsing in nature and treated by depot and oral medication with which he was compliant. Despite this he was prone to rapid deterioration in his mental state and on the 10/11/2014 he suffered an acute deterioration in his mental state and attended an emergency department of a hospital and he was reported to be expressing suicidal ideation and suffering auditory hallucinations. He was not triaged by a nurse nor referred for a mental health assessment in a timely and appropriate manner but left the hospital after a period of time when his condition seemed to have improved accompanied by family members. Some hours later he expressed general suicidal ideation and ran across a highway and then stopped in the middle of the road before he was hit by a car which could not have avoided the collision. It was not possible to determine whether he had deliberately intended to cause his own death by his physical actions. He died some time later from the injuries sustained.","Sadly, the basic background circumstances echo the Court's previous experience in Manchester, but also some 10 years ago in R(Takoushis) v HM Coroner for Inner North London [2004] EWHC 2927 Admin.

He was well known to psychiatric services and had previously been admitted to mental health units, both on a voluntary basis and compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act. In March of 2014 he suffered an acute deterioration in his mental state and was taken by his mother to the Emergency Department of North Manchester General Hospital. This resulted in an admission to a psychiatric unit lasting about three weeks, before he was discharged. He had a long term care coordinator, with whom he had a good working relationship. He enjoyed a period of stability for a few months, before there was a further rapid deterioration in his mental state in August 2014. Once again this resulted in his mother taking him to the Emergency Department at North Manchester General Hospital. This in turn led to his admission to a psychiatric unit for about ten days, before he was then discharged. The hospital computer system indicated that he had a history of 27 previous admissions.

His responsible clinician changed in September 2014 and he saw him for a review appointment. At this stage he was being given monthly depot medication, supplemented by a small amount of oral medication. The deceased presented very well at the review appointment. On 6 November 2014 he saw his newly appointed care coordinator for the first time and presented as being quite well and stable. He was cooperative and wishing to engage with services. He had also just had his monthly depot medication administered. He attended a family meal on 9 November 2014 when he appeared to be quite well.

At about 16.30 hours on the 10 November 2014 he attended his mother's home and was in an obviously agitated state and was voicing suicidal ideation. His sister phoned the Crisis Team at about 5.00pm and was advised to seek assistance from his GP or alternatively take him to the Emergency Department at North Manchester General Hospital.

The family opted for the latter and he arrived at about 5.15pm and was booked in by reception at 5.18pm by his sister. She was particularly concerned about his presentation because she had not experienced him expressing suicidal ideation before. Prior to arrival he had consumed a tablet of Zopiclone. He remained outside for significant periods of time, as the Emergency Department was particularly busy.

He was meant to be triaged within 15 minutes but was never seen. After waiting over an hour he indicated to his family members who were present that he was feeling a little better and described himself as ""healed"". He wanted to leave and go to his mother's address. His sister spoke to the receptionist again to point out that he had been suicidal and had not been seen, but now wanted to go home. She was directed to speak to a member of staff. It is recorded in the Emergency Department's computer records that he left the Department after 1 hour 19 minutes.

He ingested a tablet of Zopiclone medication and was taken by his sister to the Emergency Department of North Manchester General Hospital, which had experienced excessive demand for services from about 10.00 hours. There had been a serious and significant failure to trigger an escalation policy at the hospital and set up a secondary triage point and seek additional resources. The deceased was booked into reception by his sister at 17.18 hours and the receptionist was told that he was suicidal and was suffering auditory hallucinations, although she only recorded that he was hearing voices. The Court found as a fact that the receptionist had been told that he was suicidal. He was not suffering from any physical condition requiring assessment or treatment and was meant to be triaged by a nurse within 15 minutes, but he was not seen at all in a period of about 1 hour 19 minutes despite his sister reminding the receptionist that he was suffering from suicidal ideation and speaking to a member of the nursing staff.

There was a serious and significant failure to ensure that he was triaged in accordance with long established national guidelines. Had he been so then he would have been referred for a mental health assessment to be undertaken in the Emergency Department by a mental health nurse. At the time, the mental health team were located in a portacabin and not within the Emergency Department. The deceased indicated that he was feeling better and wanted to go home. He returned to his mother's address and consumed two further tablets of Zopiclone and went off to sleep. He awoke some time after 22.00 hours and told his mother that he wanted to get some fresh air and go to a local shop. He reiterated that he felt suicidal.

A short time later he left that address and at about 22.48 hours on 10 November 2014 the deceased ran across the carriageway in Rochdale Road, Blackley, Manchester near to Smethurst Street, but came to a sudden halt in the carriageway and was in collision with a motor car. He sustained multiple serious injuries and was taken to the Salford Royal Hospital for assessment and treatment of a serious head injury but died there on the 30 November 2014. On the evidence it was not possible to conclude that despite the serious and significant failures to initiate the escalation policy and/or triage him or make a consequent and necessary mental health referral that he probably would have survived or his life would have been prolonged.

The records suggest that he was going to see his GP but the family indicated that they actually said they would try and contact his CPN. The Emergency Department had been experiencing excessive demand for their services from about 9.00am that morning, which should have triggered the initiation of the escalation policy and setting up of a second triage point. It seems that by late afternoon the national standard of 15 minutes to be triaged from arrival was being missed for a number of patients. The deceased suffered from no physical condition requiring assessment or treatment but if he had been triaged it is obvious that he would have been referred for a mental health assessment.

The available mental health staff on duty that day had also experienced significant demand for their services and there was one Registered Mental Nurse on duty who would ordinarily undertake the assessments.

On arriving home the deceased ingested two further Zopiclone tablets and then went to sleep, but awoke shortly after 10.00pm. Sometime after 10.30pm he told his mother that he needed to go out and have a breath of fresh air and was also going to visit a local shop. He reiterated that he was still having suicidal thoughts.

At 10.48pm, a short distance away from his mother's address, he ran across Rochdale Road but then came to a sudden halt in front of moving traffic and was hit by a motor car. He sustained serious injuries and was then admitted to the Salford Neural Head Injuries Unit for further assessment and treatment.

Sadly, his condition deteriorated and he died on 30 November 2014.","5.1 Whilst recognising that Emergency Departments can be busy, reception staff did not work to a short bullet point pro-forma checklist which identifies issues of mental disorder/conditions and check and record important background issues, such as self-harming behaviour or suicidal ideation. This information is vital to record and should trigger urgent triage/mental health assessment.

5.2 There was no clear system to trigger urgent triage and safeguarding steps prior to that.

5.3 There was no clear system following triage and mental health assessment referral, to safeguard the patient pending that assessment.

5.4 There should be a clear and well-understood escalation policy which is activated appropriately.

5.5 Consideration should be given to co-locating mental health staff in the Emergency Department.

5.6 Consideration should be given to having a suitable safeguarding room(s) available.

5.7 Both Hospital Trust and Mental Health Trust staff should be able to access their respective computer systems.

5.8 Consideration should be given to training hospital reception staff, clinical and nursing staff about the issues that arise from patients attending, presenting with either acute mental disorder or mental health problems, and how best to triage and safeguard these individuals.

5.9 Both the Hospital Trust and the Mental Health Trust should consider having simple working protocols between them.

5.10 The Mental Health Trust should consider whether the staffing is sufficient to meet the needs/demands of the service.

5.11 Both Trusts should consider utilising a simple urgent alert system for patients with an acute mental health presentation that can be accessed and acted upon even before an initial triage by hospital nursing staff by mental health staff.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Nathan died from a severe head injury on 5 March 2016 at approximately 01.25 hours at Long Lane, Todd Hills, Binchester, County Durham when his car left the road, hit a tree with such force as to disable the airbags and rolled. The road was icy and had not been gritted. It had been a road traffic collision.","Nathan was travelling on a road with which he was familiar. He was travelling home after work.

The car was in good working order and he was wearing a seatbelt. There was nothing to suggest that he was driving at a speed above the legal speed limit. His mobile phone was in a back pocket and therefore he was not using it. The evidence of the police officer from the Collision Investigation Unit of Cleveland and Durham Police Specialist Operations Unit and of the senior officer overseeing the investigation was that the probable cause of Nathan’s car leaving the road was the road surface being slippery and icy. They described its condition as “unsafe”. The officer of the Collision Investigation Unit said it had been too dangerous to conduct a post incident skid test. Other officers attending the scene were reported to have stated how they had nearly lost control of their 4 x 4 police vehicle at the same point in the road. The officers giving evidence concurred that a “microclimate” at the point where Nathan had left the road had produced extremely icy and slippery conditions which were “freakish and extreme” which had resulted in the incident in which Nathan had been killed. The road was untreated. The evidence of the Highway Services Manager who had taken the decision at 12:00 on Friday 4 March, based on the 11:42 hours weather forecast, with regard to winter maintenance action for Friday evening and Saturday morning was that he was following the policy (which he exhibited to his statement) and the weather forecast.

Hassell,London Inner North,Deputy Assistant Commissioner Fiona Taylor Metropolitan Police Service,"On 24 December 2014, I commenced an investigation into the death of Henry David Hicks, aged 18 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 June 2016. The jury made a narrative determination, a copy of which I attach to this letter.","Henry Hicks died as a consequence of a road traffic collision that occurred on 19 December 2014.

He lost control of the moped he was riding at 53mph in a 20mph limit on Wheelwright Street in Islington (adjacent to HM Prison Pentonville), clipped a taxi and came off, landing in front of an oncoming vehicle.

Two unmarked police cars had been following the moped up Caledonian Road, suspecting the vehicle was a ringer and the rider was drug dealing. Both cars activated their warning equipment. One turned into Wheelwright Street after the moped, and the other carried on up Caledonian Road.","The driver and operator of police car 1 and the driver and operator of police car 2 (Officers A, B, C & D) all gave evidence in court that they were never in a position to signal to the rider of the moped to pull over, though this was what they wanted to happen.

All four gave evidence that they believed at the time of the collision, and that they still believed at the time of the inquest, that the rider was unaware of police behind him wanting him to stop.

For these reasons the officers said, they did not consider themselves to be in pursuit and therefore did not seek authorisation to continue.

The jury made a determination that Henry Hicks was aware of the police behind him and that this was a police pursuit within the definition of the Metropolitan Police Service standard operating procedure. The jury also made a determination that Henry’s attempt to avoid the police was a contributory factor in the collision.

Whilst I appreciate that we do not know whether, if the police officers had sought authorisation, this would have been granted, and so whether, if they had treated this as a pursuit, the outcome would have been different, it seems to me that this is a matter I must bring to your attention. All four officers gave a proper understanding of the MPS relevant standard operating procedure. However, by implication, the jury did not accept that this SOP was complied with on 19 December 2014.",False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,18,Male,Driver

An investigation was commenced by my colleague coroner in Avon on 7 December 2015 and the conduct of the investigation into his death was transferred to me following which I opened George’s inquest on 16 December 2015 at which time upon being satisfied as regards identification I duly released his body back to his family following an examination after death. My conclusion at inquest was that George had died as a result of road traffic collision which had occurred on 21 November 2015 in the village of Lockeridge, Wiltshire.","• The road traffic incident involving George occurred at approximately 1044 on Saturday 21 November 2015; • George was a pedestrian who was walking his dog along the nearside of C38 in the village of Lockeridge, Wiltshire (OS grid ref 148677) more likely than not heading south. • George was struck by a Vauxhall Zafira travelling in the same direction through the village. The collision caused George to strike the nearside windscreen and “A” pillar of the Zafira which resulted in George sustaining a serious head injury. • The driver of the Zafira more likely than not was blinded by the sudden appearance of sunlight through a gap in the tree-line and as a consequence was not aware of George’s presence on the nearside of the road. The exact point where the driver would have been affected by the sun is unclear but it more likely than not was approximately just short of 30m from the northernmost give way markings at the junction with Ryles Lane. • The precise speed the Zafira was travelling was unknown but was not likely to have exceeded 25 mph at the time of the collision. • As a result of the collision George was taken to Southmead Hospital, Westbury-on-Trym where he died as a result of his head injury on 3 December 2015.","During the course of hearing evidence I heard from [REDACTED] who, whilst not making any recommendations directly relating to the exact circumstances of George’s death, did indirectly highlight a concern relative to a nearby children’s playground, the access to which from the village, which included the route George was on at the time, highlighted the fact, not unsurprisingly given the location, that there were no pedestrian pavements. I think the simplest thing is for me to enclose with this report a copy of [REDACTED] report which highlights the location of the playground in question, which lies to the north of the collision point involving George, which took place at OS grid reference 148677. The similarity with the circumstances of George’s death relate to the fact that George at the time was struck by the Zafira whilst walking on the highway due to the absence of any pavements.

My initial reaction when reading [REDACTED] was that there could be many scenarios whereby villages, due to their history in relation to highways, may not be wide enough to accommodate pedestrian pavements, but the location here of the playground and also regards its safe access by villagers, including children, does cause me concern. Whilst it is fair to say there have been no incidents in the previous four years, I am sufficiently concerned so as to support [REDACTED] recommendation that motorists and other highway users ought to be alerted to the fact that there are no footways and that pedestrians are likely to be walking at the side of the road, and as such I am satisfied that there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and as such I was satisfied that my statutory duty to report those concerns has been triggered.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Pedestrian

On the evening of 8 November 2015 Harold James Davies was driving his Volvo motorcar along Station Road, Collingham, Nottinghamshire towards its junction with the A46 dual carriageway.
2. From the surrounding evidence, it is likely that Mr Davies was intending to cross over the northbound carriageway of the A46 and turn right into the southbound carriageway towards Newark.
3. Mr Davies did not stop at the junction or give way to oncoming traffic in the northbound carriageway, and collided with a Jaguar motorcar travelling in lane 2.
4. Subsequent investigation of the vehicles involved in the collision and of the collision scene itself concluded:
(a) There were no mechanical or electrical defects in either vehicle that would have caused or contributed to the collision
(b) Neither driver was under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants
(c) The weather conditions were reasonable
(d) Both lighting and visibility were good
(e) The carriageways were free of any defects or contaminants that might have caused or contributed to the collision
(f) The warning signs on the approach to the junction were clear and unobstructed.","1.

2. Highways England and their maintenance contractor A-One+ have undertaken an extensive risk assessment of the junction and there is a proposal to undertake the following remedial safety work:
(a) vehicle activated signs on both carriageways of the A46 to alert oncoming traffic of the presence of vehicles at the junction waiting to join or cross the carriageways
(b) the installation of slim line bollards at the Station Road junction
(c) appropriate demarcation of the central reservation/turning area.

3. Evidence was given at the inquest that there is no date for the approval of funding or the commencement of the remedial safety work.

4. The national speed limit on Station Road on its approach to the junction with the A46 is 60 mph. The SCIO gave evidence that additional warning signs and a possible reduction in speed limit on the approach would provide additional safety for drivers who were unfamiliar with the Station Road and its approach to the junction.

Tomalin,"County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay",Devon Highways; Devon County Council,On 15 July 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of David Alan Curtis. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 26 February 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was “Road traffic collision”. Mr Curtis died from “moving blunt force trauma to the head and chest”.,"Mr Curtis was riding his Suzuki motorcycle [REDACTED] along the A3079 Holsworthy Road, Okehampton, Devon. The motorcycle was travelling north-westerly towards Thorndon Cross from Okehampton in the general direction of Halwill. The motorcycle collided with a John Deere tractor travelling in an easterly direction towards Foley Cross. The registration of the tractor is [REDACTED]. The weather conditions were good, the road was dry and in good condition.

As the motorcycle crested the hill from the Okehampton direction, instead of negotiating the left hand bend at the top of that hill, it travelled straight on, colliding with the nearside front wheel of the tractor. The motorcycle and the rider finished up in the gateway to a field and lane entrance on the opposite side of the road.

No mechanical defects were found with either the tractor or the motorcycle. The Police Forensic Collision Investigator concluded that the motorcycle was not travelling at a speed in excess of the national speed limit and, in any event, the left hand bend, if the motorcyclist knew it was there, could have been negotiated at a speed above the national speed limit. The tractor had remained at all times in its correct carriageway.

There was nothing that the motorcyclist or the tractor driver could have done to avoid the collision once the motorcyclist had crossed into the opposite carriageway in front of the tractor.","When approaching from the Okehampton direction (the direction in which the motorcycle was travelling), there is a warning triangle sign advising motorists that they are approaching a 12% decrease in the gradient. There is no warning triangle indicating a left hand bend ahead. Conversely, when travelling from the opposite direction (Halwill towards Okehampton) there is a warning triangle indicating a right hand bend ahead and immediately below that there is another warning traffic sign indicating a slippery road. There was no prior signage warning vehicle users approaching the Halwill direction; the apparent course of the road ahead is denoted by the convergence of hedge lines towards the right.

Photographs taken of the road from Halwill towards Okehampton (the direction the motorcycle was travelling) show the crest of the hill but does not indicate that there is a left hand bend immediately beyond that crest until the driver or rider arrives at that crest. If it was deemed necessary to warn drivers travelling from Halwill towards Okehampton that there is a right hand bend ahead, which can be seen from some distance away in that particular carriageway, it would seem appropriate to consider that drivers travelling from Okehampton towards Halwill should have the benefit of a warning triangle sign indicating the left hand bend ahead, particularly where that bend cannot be seen until the hill is crested.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Other

Griffin,Greater Manchester West,"The Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP, Secretary of State for Transport","On the 14th August 2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of Norah Mary Fairhurst, born on the 21st December 1952.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 5th January 2016.","At around 14.47 hours on Saturday 8 August 2015 a Volvo FRH, articulated lorry, registration number [REDACTED] was being driven along Gerard Street on the A58 in Ashton in Makerfield, Wigan by [REDACTED]. The vehicle is a left hand drive model which was registered in the UK. As the lorry approached a puffin crossing on Gerard Street, the traffic lights changed to red and [REDACTED] slowed down in accordance with the requirements of the red light. At this time Mrs Fairhurst crossed Gerard Street a considerable distance from the puffin crossing at a diagonal angle, approaching the vehicle from the right hand side. As the lights changed to green [REDACTED] continued on his journey and the vehicle collided with Mrs Fairhurst, who at this point was directly in front of the vehicle, causing her multiple injuries which led to her death.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. The heavy goods vehicle involved in the collision was in good working condition and had visibility mirrors in accordance with legislation. [REDACTED] driving was in accordance with that of a reasonable and competent driver. At the time of the collision Mrs Fairhurst had crossed the road in such a manner that she would not have been visible to [REDACTED] prior to the collision, either in any of the mirrors of the vehicle, or from his direct line of vision from the vehicle.

ii. I heard evidence that there are many blind spots on a large goods vehicle, but one of the most concerning blind spots is in front of the vehicle. Due to the size and height of a large goods vehicle a driver is unable to see directly in front of the vehicle and so if a pedestrian or cyclist were in front of the vehicle, the driver would not see them.

iii. I heard evidence that in 2008 legislation came into force that required any large goods vehicle registered after a certain date to have a Class VI mirror, also known as a cyclops mirror, fitted to the front of the vehicle so that the driver would be able to see directly in front of the vehicle. If used appropriately this mirror could therefore identify anyone, or anything, in front of the vehicle. The legislation however, did not provide for the fitting of such mirrors to large goods vehicles registered before 2008.

iv. I have since been made aware that pursuant to Directive 2007/97/EC, it became mandatory for all goods vehicles manufactured over 7500 tonnes to have a Class VI mirror fitted to the front. I understand however, that it was agreed and is stated in the Heavy Goods Inspectorate Manual that 'vehicles registered from 26 January 2007 but before 26 January 2008 in excess of 7500kg may not have a front mirror'. Accordingly, any vehicle registered from 26 January 2008 must have a front mirror fitted, but those registered before do not require one.

v. The large goods vehicle involved in the collision with Mrs Fairhurst was registered on a date before 26 January 2008 and as a result did not have a Class VI front mirror attached to the vehicle. [REDACTED] stated in evidence that this would have assisted him in seeing something directly in front of his vehicle.

vi. I heard evidence from [REDACTED] the Forensic Collision Reconstruction Officer, that there have been a number of fatal incidents in similar circumstances as occurred in Mrs Fairhurst's death, and that if used appropriately the Class VI mirror would identify persons in front of a vehicle and could therefore prevent a collision and serious or fatal injury occurring to pedestrians or cyclists.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. Due to the lack of Class VI front mirrors on large goods vehicles registered before 26 January 2008, future deaths could occur involving pedestrians or cyclists who are positioned directly in front of such a vehicle due to the fact they cannot be seen by the driver of the large goods vehicle.

ii. I therefore request that a review be conducted of the regulations regarding the use of Class VI mirrors, designed for pedestrian and cyclist activity at the front of large goods vehicles, in order to consider the requirement to use such mirrors on large goods vehicles registered prior to 26 January 2008.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,62,Female,Pedestrian

Ellery,"Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin",Mr David Shaw – Chief Constable West Mercia Police,"On 9 June 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Stefen Neil BOSWELL and opened an inquest on 12 June 2014. The inquest, with a jury, was concluded at Shrewsbury Coroners Court between 12 and 15 October 2015. The deceased died from multiple injuries and the conclusion of the jury was that the death was due to road traffic collision.","Following a car key burglary in Craven Arms on 6 June 2014 a police pursuit shortly occurred. The driver, Stefen Neil Boswell, lost control of the vehicle at Emstrey island resulting in his death. The actions taken by the police officer involved in the pursuit were justified and did not contribute to the fatal outcome and death of Stefen Neil Boswell.","Training and policies – police pursuit

1) The West Mercia Police policy states that ‘at no time must police patrols pursue the wrong way along dual carriageways/motorways’.

2) This policy appears at variance with national policy. A report from the Association of Chief Police Officers, Police Pursuits Review Group, dated 3 November 2014 (the ACPO report) states, in part:

• ‘we draw reference to the views of the national ACPO portfolio on pursuits, which consider that in exceptional circumstances such decision making may be justifiable’.

• ‘entering a dual carriageway contrary to the normal directional flow is extremely high risk and potentially very dangerous for reasons which are obvious. Such decision making is one for the officer himself to justify ... It is the view of the ACPO pursuits group that such decisions should only be made in rare and exceptional circumstances’.

• ‘travelling the wrong way down a dual carriageway is not something we would endorse as suitable unless exceptional circumstances prevail and it is necessary and proportionate to attempt this tactic based upon the high degree of threat, risk and harm required to justify this decision’.

3) The evidence of the police driver training instructor, since retired, was that he had trained the police driver concerned in accordance with national guidance, in so far as the police driver, as accepted by the jury, followed the stolen car on the wrong side of the dual carriageway and justified his decision to do so.

4) Without challenging the evidence given by the driver training instructor West Mercia Police state that the training, as given, differed from and was not their policy.

5) On the face of it therefore is a difference between local and national policies, resulting in the possibility that a police officer, in one area, may pursue a vehicle on the wrong side of a dual carriageway, when another officer in the same set of circumstances, in another area, may not.

6) The ACPO report stated that the national Authorised Professional Practice (APP) document covering police pursuits should be the guide and accepted policy for pursuit management, thereby ensuring consistency and standards are applied.

Local Knowledge

7) At the time of the pursuit the pursuing police driver believed that the supervising inspector would have known that he was travelling on the wrong side of the dual carriageway. The supervising inspector, who was not based in the immediate area, did not know and when she did the pursuit was abandoned. Local knowledge cannot be guaranteed in a regional police force and systems should be in place that if such a situation were to reoccur, the police driver should expressly state, and the supervising inspector expressly request, if the police vehicle is travelling on the wrong side of a dual carriageway.

Other issues.

8) At the time of the collision West Mercia Police was in transitional stages of the alliance with Warwickshire Police. That included amalgamating similar but different police fleet vehicles with different on-board recording equipment. At the time of this report West Mercia Police/Warwickshire Police are seeking to address these issues and, subject to due sensitivity of any operational matters arising, confirmation of the position is sought.

9) The pursuing police vehicle did not have a dash cam recorded on-board. If it had considerable time would have been avoided at the inquest in seeking to establish and/or resolve the factual circumstances leading to and the course of the police pursuit.

Brown,Birmingham and Solihull,The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority,"On 09/07/2015 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Francis Driscoll. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 December 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that the deceased died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham on 30 June 2015 as a result of the effects of injuries sustained in a road traffic collision on 23 June 2015. At the time of the collision the deceased was a pedestrian proceeding appropriately along the pavement of the Lordswood Road, Birmingham when he was hit by a vehicle from behind that had left the road and mounted the pavement. The driver of the vehicle which hit him had lost control of the vehicle due to an epileptic seizure. The driver did not know she was suffering from epilepsy but there was an opportunity for further investigations into her health to have been made as a result of a DVLA assessment in early 2015 that was itself a result of a road traffic accident in September 2014. It is likely that with further investigation of her medical condition the driver would have been diagnosed with epilepsy before the accident with the deceased and as a consequence would not have been driving at that time.","On 24 March 2015 the third party driver’s GP [REDACTED] had completed a POLN 3 form at the request of the DVLA following a referral to the DVLA by the police arising out of damage only RTC when the third party driver, [REDACTED], was driving on 27 September 2014. Following the RTC on 27 September 2014 [REDACTED] had no recollection of how the accident came to occur and the referral was made because the police that attended were concerned that it may have been the result of a medical condition. [REDACTED] had been diagnosed with Transient Global Amnesia (‘TGA’) in July 2014 as a result of Transient Ischaemic Attacks, the last known attack taking place in April 2014. [REDACTED] filled out the POLN3 correctly in 2015 and in response to question 17 provided the name of a ‘Relevant Consultant’ [REDACTED] at City Hospital, Birmingham. [REDACTED] had made the diagnosis of TGA in 2014. At no point did the form allow [REDACTED] to explain why he thought [REDACTED] was ‘relevant’ and he did not do so. At no point did the form allow Dr. Chan to express any general reservations or concerns about [REDACTED] fitness to drive. [REDACTED] was not contacted and was therefore unaware that [REDACTED] had suffered a further episode of amnesia whilst driving.",[REDACTED] gave evidence that if he had been aware of the incident in September 2014 he would have carried out further investigations revealing the epilepsy that was ultimately diagnosed in August 2015 and thus preventing [REDACTED] from driving before the collision with the deceased. It appears that there are serious deficiencies in the medical assessment process as regards the limited investigation into the health conditions on the form POLN3 and/or in not following up the GP’s identification of a ‘Relevant Consultant’.

The conclusion of the inquest was road traffic collision. The medical cause of death was found to be: 1a multiple injuries. 1b 1c 2","Jonathan Edward Hawes was born on 7 November 1966. At the time of his death, he was 48 years of age.

Mr Hawes was a very experienced motorcyclist, having ridden motorcycles for in excess of 30 years.

On 24 May 2015, he was riding with 2 friends in convoy, with Mr Hawes leading the group. They were travelling at a leisurely pace, between 20-30 mph on the A3055 Cowleaze Hill, Shanklin from the Ventnor direction. The road is a single lane carriageway in both directions, subject to the national speed limit, i.e. 60 mph.

A white Renault Megane motor vehicle was travelling in the opposite direction being driven by a man, accompanied by his wife (in the front passenger seat) and 2 children in the rear of the vehicle. This vehicle was travelling below 30 mph.

The road twists and turns with bends in both directions and is subject to a degree of camber in places. As the car driver rounded a left-hand bend, there was a blind kink in the road to his right. He suddenly became aware of a motorcycle appearing from the other direction which was leaning heavily to its left side. The motorcycle dropped flat to the ground and slid across the carriageway slamming into the front of the car.

The car’s airbags immediately inflated. The driver exited the vehicle and found the motorcyclist appeared to have died instantly in the collision with the front of his vehicle.

Assistance was provided from people living near to the scene of the collision, and paramedics arrived shortly after the incident, but they were unable to resuscitate Mr Hawes and pronounced him life extinct at 17.15 hours.

Examination of the vehicles involved revealed no defects, however it is likely that Mr Hawes was in 5th gear (out of 6), when the other experienced motorcyclists and Police witnesses suggested that a more appropriate gear to take that bend might be 2nd or 3rd gear.","1. During the course of the evidence, it became clear that whilst this stretch of road is subject to the national speed limit of 60 mph, all of the witnesses who gave evidence and who traverse the road regularly suggested that it would be dangerous to attempt to drive that stretch of road where there are blind bends and cambers, at 60 mph.

2. I am concerned that a reconsideration of the speed limit on Cowleaze Hill should be undertaken.

3.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 August 2015.

The medical cause of death was 1a) Multi organ failure, 1b) Multiple injuries, II) Calcified aortic valve stenosis.

The conclusion of the inquest was George James Ainsworth died as a consequence of injuries sustained in a road traffic collision on a background of naturally occurring disease.","George James Ainsworth died at the Salford Royal Hospital, Eccles Old Road, Salford on 13 December 2013.

On 29 November 2013 Mr Ainsworth was struck by a bus on Knowsley Street, Bolton, near to its junction with Deansgate, Bolton. The bus was being driven east along Deansgate and was negotiating a left hand bend where the road name changes to Knowsley Street, Bolton. The nearside of the vehicle was in collision with Mr Ainsworth, who had entered the carriageway from the driver's nearside.

Mr Ainsworth, who suffered from naturally occurring calcified aortic valve stenosis, suffered multiple injuries and he was taken to Salford Royal Hospital, Salford where he subsequently deteriorated and died.

The evidence at the Inquest was that the collision occurred in Bolton Town Centre which is a busy shopping area with high volumes of pedestrians and vehicular traffic throughout the day. Prior to the formation of pedestrian areas at the location of the collision a crossroad junction was in place with Deansgate having priority over Knowsley Street and Oxford Street. Following alteration in the road layout Deansgate on the eastern side of the junction and Oxford Street to the south were closed to vehicular traffic, where Deansgate (to the west) and Knowsley Street became a through road with Deansgate running generally west to east and Knowsley Street south to north. The transition point at which the road name changes now forms a bend at 90 degrees.

The Greater Manchester Police investigation noted that the bend where Deansgate becomes Knowsley Street creates a ""pinch point"" when two large vehicles, such as buses, attempt to negotiate the bend at the same time resulting in one or the other having to give way.

Traffic on both roads on the approach to the bend is controlled by an automatic traffic signal to stop vehicles whilst the pedestrian crossing at the junction is in operation. The traffic signal incorporates a pedestrian crossing facility located at the apex of the bend operated by various demand boxes. The bounds of the pedestrian crossing are highlighted by metal studs embedded in the road, creating a cross crossing that is some 9.5 metres wide.

Travelling south along Knowsley Street towards the collision scene the southbound lane comprises a bus lane only separated from the northbound lane on the immediate approach to the bend by hazard warning lines. The lane markings terminate at the stop line controlling the southbound traffic some 20 metres from the centre of the crossing on the apex of the bend.

Travelling east along Deansgate towards the collision scene the east and westbound lane are separated by a hazard warning lines and there are no restrictions regarding access by specific vehicles. The lane markings terminate at a stop line controlling eastbound traffic some 17 metres from the centre of the crossing from the apex of the bend.

Beyond the restrictive stop lines there are no lane dividers through the bend and the area of the crossing.

There are no guard rails on the footpath on either side of the road both before and after the pedestrian crossing. Accordingly pedestrians are free to cross the road outside the pedestrian crossing without restriction by guard rails.

The evidence considered the steering of a bus around the left hand bend at the junction of Deansgate into Knowsley Street. The steering wheels on the bus are set back from the front of the vehicle by some 2.3 metres and are behind the driver's seat position. Therefore, when negotiating a tight turn such as the left hand turn through the junction onto Knowsley Street the front of the vehicle will be beyond the arched path taken by the front wheels.

The evidence at the Inquest accepted that there were blind spots which affect the driver's view of the road, specifically to the front nearside of the vehicle in this collision. Blind spots are created by the structure of the vehicle such as the ""A"" pillars at either corner of the front windscreen, as well as the various panels such as those which make up the framework of the passenger doors and the presence of mirrors; all of which present physical obstruction to the driver's view. The view is further compromised by the installation of bandit or security screens around the driver's cab which were fitted in the vehicle in the collision.

The Greater Manchester Police evidence was that the blind spots on the bus were sufficient to fully obscure the presence of a pedestrian in certain areas to the front nearside of the vehicle.

The evidence at the Inquest revealed the fact that the building line at the junction of Deansgate and Knowsley Street, on the side from which Mr Ainsworth was crossing the road, would also restrict the view of the driver in relation to a pedestrian crossing from that side road when the driver was making the left turn.

It was accepted that Mr Ainsworth was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing but there is nothing to prevent a pedestrian crossing the road from that location. Mr Ainsworth entered the carriageway outside the bounds of the crossing and against the pedestrian signals, which were showing red for pedestrians, when the collision occurred. At the time the bus driver had negotiated the apex of the bend and continued through the turning manoeuvre passing, over the pedestrian crossing, as Mr Ainsworth continued to walk out towards the centre of the road. Calculations indicated that the bus was travelling at less than 10 miles per hour on the immediate approach to the collision.

Evidence was also given at the Inquest, as an incidental comment, that some pedestrians find the time allowed to cross the crossing within the pedestrian crossing phase to be insufficient and further evidence was given that the time allowed for pedestrians to cross at the pedestrian crossing could be extended by an adjustment to the automatic traffic signal.","1. During the inquest evidence was heard that

i. The junction of Deansgate into Knowsley Street is a 90 degree left hand bend with no restrictions on the vehicles entering the junction, other than the pedestrian crossing. Greater Manchester Police gave evidence that there is a ""pinch point"" when two large vehicles, such as buses, attempt to negotiate the bend at the same time resulting in one or the other having to give way. There was further evidence that the driver of a bus at the junction from Deansgate into Knowsley Street would have blind spots on the vehicle together with a limited pre-junction view around the bend due to the building line, which would affect the driver's view of the road, particularly to the front nearside of the vehicle. The blind spots and limitations to the driver's view of the road occur at a time when a driver is negotiating a narrow bend where there is a ""pinch point"" at the apex of the bend. Accordingly pedestrians who are free to cross the road outside the areas of the pedestrian crossing are at risk due to the driver's restricted view.

The presence of guard rails, particularly along the stretch of pavement on the left hand side from Deansgate into Knowsley Street from where Mr Ainsworth crossed the road, with the exception of the area of the pedestrian crossing, would take account of the driver's restricted view and would prevent pedestrians crossing the road outside the area of the pedestrian crossing, where a driver would have a restricted view.

ii. The time allowed for a pedestrian to cross the pedestrian crossing may not allow sufficient time for some pedestrians to cross the junction between Deansgate and Knowsley Street and an increase of the pedestrian crossing time would allow sufficient time for all pedestrians to cross the junction.

iii. The evidence raised concerns that there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken to review the above issues.

2. I request you to consider the above concerns and to carry out a review with regard to the following:

i. A general review of the pedestrian crossing at the junction of Deansgate and Knowsley Street with specific consideration of the erection of guard rails to limit pedestrians crossing the road to the confines of the pedestrian crossing.

In evidence at the inquest, the expert crash reconstruction police officer confirmed that if the crossing which traverses Curzon Road were to be positioned further away from the mini roundabout and the footpath by the roundabout to be protected by pedestrian barriers, this would be a much safer environment.

Turner,"West Sussex, Brighton and Hove","Andrew Jones MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport, Department for Transport","On 10 July 2014 the West Sussex Coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Giuseppina Incisivo, aged 79. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 28 July 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Collision.","Ms Incisivo was crossing North Street in the centre of Midhurst whilst the traffic was stop/start. She moved in front of a medium sized (27 gross tonnes) lorry, very close to the front, when the traffic suddenly moved off. She was run over and suffered catastrophic, traumatic injuries, dying at the scene within minutes. The driver’s evidence was simply that he did not see her. Other witnesses suggested he could not have done so directly, and a reconstruction by the Sussex Police Forensic Collision Investigation Unit showed that Ms Incisivo would have come well under the height of the bottom of the windscreen. The vehicle had a front ‘blind spot’ mirror fitted and in good working order, but the evidence was that either a. The driver had visually swept the mirror (his evidence) but in the time delay before moving off Ms Incisivo had then moved in front of the vehicle, unobserved, or b. The size and shape of her image in the convex mirror, and lack of visual contrast between Ms Incisivo, a dark-haired, greying, lady around 5 feet tall, in light clothing, and the road surface, meant that she was insufficiently conspicuous (the Investigating Officer’s expert opinion). In short, the driver, even using the mirror when she was in its reflection, would have found it very hard to distinguish Ms Incisivo.","(1) That whilst the relevant EU Directives (2003/97/EC and 2005/27/EC) and associated legal requirements for some high-fronted goods vehicles require the fitting of a ‘front blind spot mirror’ (Class VI) of a certain size, shape and resulting view, the actual shape (convex) and size of such mirrors does not provide sufficient visibility of slow moving pedestrians (especially the elderly), or of those not wearing highly visible clothing, especially when very close to the front of the vehicle.
(2) That the lack of secondary ‘front obstruction’ warning systems, such as sensors which sound an audible alarm (similar to front parking sensors), or show a red/amber/green ‘safe to move’ light in the cab, or a forward facing camera with a screen in the cab, which would supplement the mirror means that over-reliance is placed on the mirror when, patently, it may not always serve its purpose.
(3) That pedestrians, especially the elderly and children, whose height makes them difficult for drivers of such vehicles to observe may assume (wrongly) that a vehicle with a front ‘blind spot’ mirror ‘must’ see them when the reality is the opposite.
(4) That, it seems, a general lack of awareness may persist of the risk posed when passing in front of such vehicles, and an assumption persist that because someone may be able to see the windscreen of the vehicle, that the driver ‘must’ be able to see them directly or indirectly.

I am aware that other Coroners have reported similar concerns as regards older or other high fronted vehicles which need not have such mirrors.

Newman,Derby and Derbyshire,Department for Transport,"On 17 November 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Richard Anthony Marshall Turner, a 64 year old gentleman. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 June 2015. I determined that Mr Turner had died as a result of a fat embolism resulting from rib and vertebral column fractures as a result of a reversing road traffic collision. The conclusion was of an accidental death.","On 13 November 2014, a light goods vehicle, a Mercedes Sprinter van, was engaged in courier duties in Cherry Tree Square, Tideswell. The vehicle was a standard vehicle, owned by the delivery company, and which had a fully enclosed rear. No reversing aids were fitted to the vehicle.

Cherry Tree Square, Tideswell, although a designated highway, had limited vehicular access and appears to be used regularly as a parking area. It was further described as an area of limited space, and where pedestrians would be a significant potential hazard.

At around 14:10 on 13 November 2014 the driver of the delivery vehicle returned to his vehicle, having made a delivery off Cherry Tree Square. There was then a 46 second delay between returning to the vehicle, and commencing a reversing procedure. During this 46 second window, Mr Turner entered Cherry Tree Square from the rear, and would have appeared briefly (for a matter of seconds) in the right wing mirror of the Mercedes Sprinter van.

Mr Turner suffered with marked ankylosing spondylitis (curvature of the spine) resulting in him presenting as almost constantly looking at the ground and therefore his visibility would have been markedly reduced.

The Mercedes Sprinter van proceeded to reverse slowly for a total of 19 seconds at low speed, before colliding with Mr Turner, and causing him to be thrown to the floor.

Following the collision, Mr Turner did not appear to be physically injured, although in any event emergency services attended. Initial assessments of Mr Turner’s head, neck and spine by paramedics did not identify the injuries that Mr Turner had sustained, and Mr Turner wished to return home, a distance of some 80 metres from the scene of the collision. In order to continue the physical assessment the paramedics agreed to walk Mr Turner home, where he agreed to undergo more thorough examinations.

Having made it almost home Mr Turner collapsed and despite intensive resuscitation attempts passed away at 15:46 on 13 November 2014.","(1) In evidence before me, forensic examination of the delivery vehicle found no mechanical defects that may have caused or contributed to the collision, although the evidence of both the driver of the vehicle, and the investigating officers identified a significant blind spot behind the enclosed back Mercedes Sprinter, which extended the width of the vehicle, and would have reached back almost to infinity behind the vehicle.

(2) This is a form of vehicle, under 3.5 tonnes, that is used nationally, in great numbers which would be expected to reverse in potentially confined areas, where pedestrians could be expected.

(3) The evidence from both the driver and the attending officers were that had this vehicle been fitted with some form of reversing aid this collision may have been avoided. In particular the use of an audible reversing warning may have provided Mr Turner with an opportunity to avoid the collision, although the evidence of the driver and the attending officers of Derbyshire Constabulary was clear, and uncontested, that the use of a rear facing camera system would have prevented this fatality.

(4) Whilst it is appreciated that there is currently no legislation to require the fitting of reversing aids, I note that a large fleet of light goods vehicles are used daily around the United Kingdom, with significantly obstructed visibility and without the need to employ any reversing aids that could prevent similar deaths.

(5) In terms of the figures relating to such deaths evidence was provided from the ‘Mast Online’ database indicating a total of 1475 incidents relating to goods vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. I am conscious, and concerned, that such figures only represent those incidents that occur on public highways, and that I personally am aware of at least one other similar incident in my jurisdiction, that occurring on private land would not be included in any such figures. On the evidence of the senior investigating officer, reported figures could only be the ‘tip of the iceberg’.

(6) I understand that this is not simply a national concern and reference was made to the following research papers/bodies in indicating that this appears to be of international concern, not solely regarding light goods vehicles, but in cases, all vehicles.

The medical cause of death was multiple injuries due to a road traffic collision. Alcohol intoxication was a contributory, but not a direct, cause.","At about 19.30h on 2 August 2014 CT was cycling north over London Bridge. The carriageway was clear of traffic on his side of the road, as shown on CCTV. For unexplained reasons his cycle veered across the northbound carriageway, struck the kerb and precipitated him off the cycle, his body then straddling the central reservation but with his head and upper thorax thrown into the offside of the southbound carriageway where he was struck by a motor car travelling south over London Bridge.

The car had travelled southwards from north London and entered the northern end of London Bridge, behind a London bus. As soon as he was able to overtake the bus, which moved nearer towards the bus stop, the driver accelerated past. The City of London collision investigator calculated the speed of the vehicle to have been 38 mph. At the time the speed limit on the road had then recently been reduced from 30 mph to 20 mph.

The driver of the car, a foreign national unfamiliar with roads in London, believed the speed limit to have been 30 mph at the time. Even had he been correct in his belief, the evidence of the collision investigator was that at 30 mph he would probably have been able to avoid the collision. Had he been travelling at or below 20 mph he would assuredly have avoided the collision.","A review of the signage and road layout suggest that there is opportunity to take steps to try to prevent a recurrence of deaths in comparable circumstances. A driver unfamiliar with City roads, having been stuck in slow-moving traffic through the city, and on seeing the road over London Bridge open out from, first, one lane, to two lanes then to three lanes, is tempted to accelerate to a speed above the new statutory limit.

I suggest that some improved signage is desirable, to remind drivers that the speed limit on the bridge remains 20 mph. I was informed in evidence that there is no prominent speed limit signage at the commencement of the bridge and that in other places in the City only the smaller 20 mph repeater signs are displayed.

A driver travelling from south to north over Southwark Bridge will see a large 30 mph speed limit sign at the north end. If the driver turns right onto Upper Thames Street and then goes under London Bridge and turns left into Fish Street Hill, then left onto Monument Street and then left onto London Bridge there is no prominent signage to make clear that the speed limit reduces from 30 to 20 mph.

Burke,Yorkshire West Western,The Chief Constable West Yorkshire Police; Chief Executive Kirklees Council,"On 28 September 2012, an investigation was commenced into the death of Nicholas Gary Stocks aged 55 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 March 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr Stocks died from multiple traumatic injuries and I recorded a conclusion that Nicholas Gary Stocks had died as a result of a road traffic collision.","On Thursday 27 September 2012, Mr Stocks and his partner walked along Lower Denby Lane, Huddersfield and were waiting to cross the A635 Barnsley Road. At that point in time a road traffic collision occurred between two vehicles. A BMW which was travelling along the A635 Barnsley Road in the direction of Holmfirth. This vehicle was struck by a Vauxhall Astra which emerged from Dry Hill Lane without stopping. As a result of the collision, the BMW vehicle struck Nicholas Gary Stocks and his partner. Tragically, Mr Stocks suffered fatal injuries and his death was confirmed at the scene.","West Yorkshire Police
(1) I am concerned that the system that was in place to ensure that matters of concern identified by Officers of West Yorkshire Police who attend the scene of Road Traffic Collision in November 2011 were not fully reported to Kirklees Council.

I would ask you to review the system presently in place to ensure that all future reports are made and fully reported

(2) On the afternoon of the 27 September 2012 following the earlier road traffic incident, a Police Officer identified the need for a repair to the Give Way sign which had been demolished. The Police Officer in attendance would have been able to also identify that the road markings at the scene were no longer visible and therefore any road user who was travelling along Dry Hill Lane would have had no visible signs or road markings on the approaching Give Way junction. In essence the Officer would have been able to undertake a risk assessment and identify the level of urgency for remedial repair works to be undertaken.

I would invite West Yorkshire Police to liaise with the relevant department of Kirklees Council and undertake a review and consider whose responsibility it should be to undertake a risk assessment at the scene of a road traffic collision in order to determine the level of urgency of remedial work which is required to be carried out so as to ensure the safety of road users and to develop a system so as to ensure that risk assessment process is implemented and carried out.

(3) I would also ask you to liaise with the relevant departments of Kirklees Council in order to carry out investigations to determine which departments of Kirklees Council was contacted on the afternoon of 27 September 2012 to report the damage to the give way sign. I heard evidence that Kirklees Council Customer Services, the relevant department which should have been contacted, and who are contactable between the hours of 8.00 and 18 hours. Outside of these hours an answer machine message provides an emergency contact number. If the control room unit had contacted the customer service centre then this telephone line should have been manned and a response received rather than sending an email which was acknowledged by an automated response. I wish to ensure that firstly West Yorkshire Police have the relevant contact number which needs to be used in the future and secondly if the Customer Service centre at Kirklees Council was contacted it clearly was not manned at the appropriate time, I wish to ensure this is rectified.

Kirklees Council
(1) I have concerns with the regard to the wide variation of how road inspections are undertaken by your Safety Inspectors. During the course of the enquiries undertaken by West Yorkshire Police a number of interviews were conducted with a number of safety inspectors. I have reviewed those interviews and note that there was a wide variation on how Safety Inspectors undertook inspections of a highway. One Inspector indicated that they would inspect one side of the road one month, and when inspecting the road the following month would inspect the other side of the carriageway. Another Inspector indicated that they would inspect the whole of the carriageway on each inspection. Another Safety Inspector stated that the driver also had a role to place in inspecting the road in addition to driving the vehicle which transported the Safety Inspector who would be seated in the front passenger seat.

(2) I have concerns with regard to how Safety Inspectors identify issues at the junction of two roads and which inspection has responsibility to consider matters at the actual junction. There appeared to have been vague and unclear responses from the Inspectors who gave evidence, as to whose responsibility it would be to actually inspect the junction of the two roads.

(3) I was concerned that neither of the two Safety Inspectors who gave evidence, considered that the lack of road markings at the junction of Barnsley Road and Dry Hill Lane, and upon Dry Hill Lane itself posed a safety risk to road users and applying appropriate risk assessment should have been repaired. I heard evidence from a highly qualified independent expert who was fully familiar with the Kirklees inspection policy and who stated that the lack of road markings at the junction with Barnsley Road and upon Dry Hill Lane itself, were identifiable and reportable defects applying Kirklees Council Policy criteria and should have been reported by the Safety Inspectors and repaired. In addition the independent expert stated that the poor state of the road markings would have been present for a considerable and significant period of time. Certainly, when each of the roads had last been inspected by a Safety Inspector from Kirklees Council.

(4) I also have concern that there is no ongoing training and assessment of Safety Inspectors after initial training has been given so as to ensure consistency and appropriate standard levels of inspections are maintained.

I would invite Kirklees Council to undertake a comprehensive review of the training of all of their Safety Inspectors and consider what further retraining requirements are required now and in the future.

(5) I would refer you to the comments I have made in the West Yorkshire Police section of this report in respect of the operation of Kirklees Council’s Customer Service Centre. I would ask you to liaise directly with West Yorkshire Police and review and ensure the Customer Centre Service facility is fully operational at all relevant times

(6) I would also ask you to liaise with West Yorkshire Police in respect of the comments made in the West Yorkshire Police Section of this report concerning risk assessments when a road traffic collision occurs and West Yorkshire Police are in attendance and identify the need for repair works to be undertaken, so as to ensure that an immediate risk assessment is undertaken to safeguard members of the public.

(7) From details provided in the course of this investigation, it appears that remedial work was required to be undertaken by Yorkshire Water at the junction with Barnsley Road and Dry Hill Lane. This work was to identified on 13 March 2010 and the 5 March 2012, but there was no record that such work had been undertaken, and no follow up was implemented by Kirklees Council, so as to ensure that this work was carried out. I would invite you to review your systems so as to ensure that work is undertaken by other agencies and checks made to ensure that all necessary works are completed.

(8) Evidence at the inquest also revealed that members of the public had reported the lack of road markings to Kirklees Council, some months prior to this incident occurring. Although Kirklees Council records show no further action required. I am concerned with regard to this finding in light of the evidence provided to me by the independent expert who confirmed that the lack of road markings was clearly a defect which fell within the Councils existing guidance as an identifiable defect which required rectification. I would invite you to review the present system that Kirklees Council has in place with addressing complaints made by members of the public in respect of the roads and highways which fall within your designated area.

9. I understand that major road works have been undertaken by Kirklees Council at the scene of this incident. However, at the inquest it was clear that the speed limit still remains to be 50 mph. I would invite you to review the speed limit not only on Dry Hill Lane, but also Barnsley Road and Lower Denby Lane.

The symptoms became more acute she came under the care of the Mental Health Team in the form of both the Crisis Team and Community Mental Health Team. Her parents had arranged for her to be seen by private clinicians and subsequently the NHS Mental Health Team and there was a brief period of overlap of care.
While expressing suicidal ideation, Miss Nigam had never attempted serious self-harm. On 4 February 2014 she was struck by a train at Twyford Railway Station.","(1) During the course of her ongoing care, Miss Nigam was being seen by a private psychiatrist and psychologist. When she reverted to NHS Mental Health Team care she still had ongoing sessions with the private psychologist. There was an opportunity to gain history and input from the private clinicians as to Miss Nigam’s history, previous treatment and what had been successful and less successful.

Ridley,Wiltshire and Swindon,The Minister of State for the Armed Forces; Ministry of Defence,"On 5 July 2010 I opened the inquests into the deaths of Colour Sergeant Martyn Horton, Lance Corporal David Ramsden, Private Douglas Halliday and Private Alexander Isaac following the repatriation of their bodies into the United Kingdom from Afghanistan. I resumed the inquest on Monday 10 November 2014 but regrettably had to adjourn proceedings on 14 November 2014 as a result of potential evidence from an expert witness necessitating, in my view, the need to recognise additional interested persons. The proceedings finally resumed on Monday 21 April 2015 and I concluded all four inquests on 24 April 2015. As a conclusion I recorded a combined short form conclusion, that of road traffic collision, combined with a narrative conclusion. I recorded in relation to the cause of death that all four had died as a result of drowning when their vehicle became submerged following a road traffic collision that occurred on the Bandi Baq Road, south of Gereshk, shortly after 2200 hours on 23 June 2010 in Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan.","I have set out below the narrative conclusion that I recorded that sets out the circumstances of death:

Road Traffic Collision whilst on Active Service in Afghanistan combined with a Narrative Conclusion as follows:

Shortly after 2200 on 23 June 2010 the front left hand side of the Remote Weapons System variant Ridgeback that Martyn, Doug and Alex were travelling in and that David was driving, collided with the front right hand side of an Afghan National Police (""ANP"") Ranger vehicle that had been parked on Bridge Harry with the front end of the vehicle protruding onto the Bandi Baq Road, South of Gereshk, Helmand Province, Afghanistan. As a result of the collision the Ridgeback veered to the left off the Bandi Baq Road and entered and overturned in the Nahr-e-Bughra Canal that ran parallel to the road. Water quickly filled the Ridgeback and Martyn, David, Doug and Alex were unable to escape and consequently drowned inside the vehicle.

The following matters contributed to the collision:
a) The speed the Ridgeback was travelling (more than 30mph but less than or equal to 40mph) at the time of the collision;
b) The inconspicuous presence of the unlit and darkly coloured ANP patrol vehicle when set against the dark background in the locality of the collision.

The following matters more likely than not impeded the ability to escape from the submerged vehicle thereby contributing to the drowning:
c) The incident occurred at night and in the dark;
d) The water was cold and murky;
e) The force of the impact when the Ridgeback hit the water causing a blunt impact head injury resulting in momentary grogginess/unconsciousness (will appear in respect of Martyn, David and Alex) and;
f) The wearing of essential body armour.","(I) Suspension issues. During the course of the inquest I heard how Ridgeback had been introduced into UK operational service as part of an urgent operational requirement to provide greater protection to UK service personnel on operation in Afghanistan due to the ever increasing threat that had been developing from improvised explosive devices. I heard how the original shell vehicle provided by the US manufacturer was modified to UK specifications by UK Government contractors and I heard that the resultant additional weight appears to have in particular resulted in an unusually large number of failures to the front spring hanger assembly, mounting bracket as well as leaf spring failures with normal usage. Morgan Advanced Materials have been contracted to remedy the problem and I understand that additional information following the involvement of [REDACTED] and members of the team of 710 Naval Squadron will be helpful in trying to find a solution. I have been provided with a timetable in respect of which various steps will be covered leading to a solution being found and rolled out which will exceed the usual 56 day time period to respond to a Regulation 28 Report. As part of my Regulation 28 duty I would like to monitor the resolution of the issue relative to the failures in the front suspension area and I am sure that the families of the four who died on 23 June 2010, even though that the failure to that particular vehicle (spring hanger bolt failure) did not cause or contribute to their deaths, would also like to be appraised of developments insofar as sensitive material is not disclosed. I am however still concerned that the focus appears to be solely on the front suspension where the vast majority of the failures occurred. I would therefore ask for confirmation that given the modifications affected the overall operational load of the vehicle that the whole suspension system is reviewed with a view that ultimately it is fit for purpose having regard to the additional operational load that UK specification vehicles are required to deal with as compared to its American counterparts. In this respect I have suggested quarterly updates as a way forward. For the avoidance of any doubt although the inquest focussed on the Ridgeback, I am aware from the same Cougar family that the problem affected Wolfhound and Mastiff as well which of course the UK Government purchased as well.

(II) Height restrictions. During the course of hearing evidence, I heard that there were height restrictions relative to the driver of Ridgeback vehicles as well as the designated Commander of the vehicle. Ordinarily both the driver and Commander sit in the two front seats of the vehicle. The vehicle involved in this particular incident was a remote weapon system variant Ridgeback and unlike other variants, the right hand seat is occupied by the remote weapon gunner and the Commander is moved to a position sitting at right angles to the driver who of course is occupying the left hand front seat. Depending on operational assessment, I am concerned that if there is a height restriction for a driver and Commander that if a gunner is required to occupy the front right hand seat, as is the case in the remote weapon system variant, that a height restriction ought to apply to the gunner as well. In this particular tragic incident I found no evidence that the height of Private Alexander Isaac contributed to his inability to escape from the stricken Ridgeback once it had entered the canal as he was able to remove his helmet and body armour and in fact was one of the first bodies to have been recovered through the top hatch.

(III) Lighting. At the end of the day a Commander of a vehicle has overall control and a driver is required to use his or her skill and judgement relative to road conditions and the vehicle capabilities to drive at an appropriate speed taking into account speed limits. When responding to an emergency such as in the QRF (Quick Reaction Force) role as is the case when UK civilian emergency response vehicles are responding to a legitimate emergency, speed limits may not ordinarily be adhered to and I very much take the view that it should be a matter of military judgement taken by those who have situational awareness at the time. The evidence I heard was that operationally drivers could realistically only see using white light approximately 10-15 metres in front of the vehicle. There was an issue with the Ridgeback involved in this incident in that for some reason the main head lights had a lower specification bulb fitted 75/70 watts as opposed to the specified 100/80 watt bulb. The Ridgeback is also fitted with 70 watt fog lamps and set of 70 watt additional lights which were moved following the incident to the outside of the bar armour. The main lights however still lie behind the bar armour and that must impede their effectiveness. I would like you to review the effectiveness of Ridgeback lighting and arguably as it is part of the Cougar fleet, the lighting of the Mastiff and Wolfhound also as they are similar vehicles with the addition of an additional axle, as regards operational effectiveness especially if such vehicles are intended to be used in a QRF role or when operational requirements dictate a need to travel at speed. An operational limit of only 10-15 metres in front of the vehicle is in my view restrictive and significantly restricts the safe speed of the vehicle allowing for reaction and stoppage time. [REDACTED] (retired) attempted as part of the LAIT investigation to carry out tests on Salisbury Plain, although I do have some concerns in relation to the accuracy and usefulness of the data obtained from those tests.

(IV) Tyre pressures. The Ridgeback in question following recovery was found to have under inflated rear tyres some 13% less than the recommended PSI which I believe is 110. During the course of the evidence I heard that the REME maintenance crew at MOB Price did not have equipment to inflate tyres to that pressure and the on board compressor again did not have the necessary capability to inflate tyres over and above 100 PSI. I was told that if the required tyre pressure was to be achieved that the only equipment available was at Camp Bastion and of course the vehicles were not regularly, when on operational service in Afghanistan, travelling to Camp Bastion. I would ask that you review this concern. Tyre pressures are important. Both under inflated and over inflated tyres can materially affect the handling of the vehicles and if there is a specification for a certain tyre pressure then those operating or maintaining the vehicle ought to have the ability to ensure the correct tyre pressure is achievable. Again this potentially is applicable across the Cougar family fleet.

(V) AESP Torque references. During the course of the evidence I heard that the maintenance of the Ridgeback vehicle was governed by AESP documentation. I was told by Craftsman [REDACTED] that regularly at MOB Price during Herrick 12 whilst maintaining these vehicles that he was unaware of the correct torque settings in relation to the front spring hanger assembly bolts and would ensure in the circumstances that the bolts, to quote him, were “fucking tight”. There were however torque settings but those settings appear to have been contained in the repair section of the AESP documentation in Section 5 as opposed to the maintenance section in Section 6. I fully accepted the evidence I heard that the AESP documentation is voluminous but I am concerned and believe that it would be of assistance to REME personnel and those responsible for the maintenance of the vehicles that consideration be given to ensuring mention of a cross reference pointing in Section 6 at the relevant section to where the torque settings can be found in Section 5 rather than repeating the verbatim the torque settings again. I would ask that you give consideration to this so as to ensure correction maintenance procedures are carried out.

(VI) Ridgeback emergency lighting. I was pleased to hear that the luminescent tape that was introduced following this incident is in the process of being replaced by an emergency lighting system called VELS. I believed that the additional work and installation of this system has only just started to be rolled out and I would be grateful for a timetable as regards its completion and also given the similarity between Ridgeback, Wolfhound and Mastiff as to whether or not it will include the other members of the Cougar family.

(VII) Component failure awareness. It was clear in 2010 that failures associated with the front suspension and spring hanger assembly in the Cougar fleet were starting to develop and following an incident involving a Ridgeback vehicle in Bovington in 2012, Qinetiq were instructed to analyse these failures. During the course of the evidence I heard from those that were maintaining these vehicles back in 2010 that the bolts on the front spring hanger assembly were in need of regular tightening and the vehicle was subject to 21 day inspection checks. The joint opinion of both [REDACTED] and members of the team at 1710 Naval Squadron was that it should not be necessary to repeatedly have to tighten the bolts relative to a component such as the spring hanger assembly. The need for the retightening of bolts was in their view indicative of a component issue and I would ask that you review from a learning point as regards raising the awareness of Craftsmen and Technicians and not just in relation to Ridgeback or Mastiff but in relation to any component across the services, that if an issue arises requiring regular or unusually frequent tightening of component bolts that that matter ought to be highlighted as a concern warranting proportionate investigation relative to other similar pieces of equipment experiencing the same issue, such as was the case here with the Cougar fleet of vehicles. The retightening of bolts on a regular basis was something that was not captured as an issue in itself.",True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver;Other

Travers,Surrey,Professor Dame Shirley Pearce – Independent Chair of the College of Policing; Chief Constable Suzette Davenport – ACPO National Road Policing Lead,"The inquest into the death of Mr Joshua Brown was opened on 6 December 2012 and was resumed on 19 January 2015 with a jury. It was concluded on 17 April 2015.
The jury found that the cause of death was:
1a – Head and neck injury.
The jury concluded with a narrative and a short form conclusion of ‘Road Traffic Collision’.
Within their narrative conclusion the jury determined that the driving of the police officer was appropriate prior to joining the A31 and on the A31, in accordance with his driver training, he took the outside lane.
However, in the brief time between his initial contact with the patchy fog and the collision, his dynamic risk assessment and hence his speed was inappropriate. They also found that, at the point of collision, Mr Brown was walking in lane 2 with his back to any potential traffic. The jury concluded that both these elements had contributed to the road traffic collision.","At shortly after 03.30 hours on 1 December 2012, a police vehicle driven by a Surrey police officer left Guildford town centre in order to respond to a grade 1 call in Farnham. The route taken by the vehicle left Guildford on the A3 and went onto the A31 Hog’s Back, west bound. The Hog’s Back is situated on top of the downs and is an isolated road. At the point where the collision occurred it is an unlit dual carriageway where the two sets of lanes are divided by an area of mature trees and bushes. The weather in Guildford was reasonably clear, but as the vehicle climbed the hill onto the downs it became increasingly foggy. On the Hog’s Back itself there was patchy dense fog. At the time of his death Joshua Brown was serving in the REME and was based at an army camp in the Farnham area. He had been in Guildford the previous evening and had become separated from his friends. At the point of the collision he was about one metre into the outside lane of the dual carriageway from its offside edge. His arm was outstretched with his thumb uppermost, as if he was ‘thumbing a lift’.
At the point of impact the speed of the vehicle was 81 mph and visibility was reduced, by reason of the fog, to 30 metres. In the circumstances it would not have been possible to have avoided a collision.","Night-time driver training

Ridley,Wiltshire and Swindon,"Secretary of State for Transport, Department for Transport; Mr Simon Thurley, Chief Executive, English Heritage; General Manager, Wiltshire Landscape, National Trust; Mr Tim Parker, Chairman of the National Trust; Corporate Director, Wiltshire Council","On 1 September 2014 I commenced an investigation into the death of Patrick Derek Sturivant, aged 37. The inquest was opened on 8 September 2014 and the final hearing was originally scheduled for 6 February 2015 however this regrettably had to be adjourned due to a breakdown in communication as regards the availability of a witness. The investigation however was concluded on Wednesday 15 April 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that Patrick, known to his family as Pat, had died as the result of a traumatic brain injury sustained in a road traffic collision. My formal conclusion on the record of inquest as to death was “Road Traffic Collision”. The collision itself occurred on 29 August 2014 with Pat passing away the following day (30 August 2014).","The collision involving Pat and a Mercedes motor vehicle occurred shortly before 2041 on the Friday 29 August 2014;

The incident occurred in the westbound lane of the A303 at Stonehenge Down near Amesbury Wiltshire approximately 1.4 mile east of its junction with the A360 and at a point adjacent to Byway 11 positioned to the south of the carriageway;

The Mercedes was travelling westbound at a speed of between 40-50mph.

Pat was crossing the carriageway with one of his passengers intending to get back in his car which was parked at the entrance to Byway 11 having escorted one of his passengers to the north side of the carriageway in order to view Stonehenge when he was struck by the Mercedes;

The sun had set over half an hour previously and it was dark;

Pat was wearing dark clothing, his passenger wearing marginally more noticeable clothing;

The headlight glare from oncoming traffic would have made both Pat and his passenger not easily visible on the far side of the road verge when approaching from the east and they more likely than not were first visible when they were crossing the eastbound side of the highway and would have been silhouetted as moving objects by the oncoming vehicle headlights;

There was insufficient time for the driver of the Mercedes to take avoiding action once Pat had started to cross the carriageway and the driver had become aware of Pat on the carriageway;

As a result of the collision Pat sustained an unsurvivable brain injury and having been taken to Southampton General hospital died at 2130 on 30 August 2014.","(1) At the end of the inquest I heard live evidence from [REDACTED] who had prepared a helpful Traffic Management and Road Safety Assessment. I have enclosed a copy of that report with this letter as it includes helpful diagrams and maps to help explain the issue.

He gave evidence having visited the scene that indications of activity on Byway 11 would appear to be limited to the area in the immediate vicinity of the A303 itself being used by the public as a car park or a stopping point so as to enable the occupants of vehicles, as indeed was the case with Pat and his passenger, to get a better view of the Stonehenge Monument lying to the north of the A303. Clearly the public are using this area in this manner and I am therefore concerned that there is a risk of future deaths occurring in similar circumstances if action is not taken.

It was not [REDACTED] opinion that the rest of Byway 11 was being actively and frequently used as a green lane. Byway 11’s current designation is as a BOAT (Byway Open to All Traffic). In Highway Law the right of the public to use such a right of way is to pass and repass along it. The right does not extend in the absence of an emergency to parking.

[REDACTED] explained that discussions have taken place with the owner of the land, The National Trust and also with Wiltshire Council Rights of Way Department and their legal team with a view to possible closing of the terminal 600 metre section of Byway 11 laying immediately south of the A303 and the Stonehenge Monument, downgrading Byway 11 down to a bridleway and then diverting the bridleway along a current permissive path on National Trust property so that the diverted right of way will then join Byway 12 approximately 400 metres south of the A303. The explanation and a plan are found on the final page of [REDACTED] report.

I can entirely see the logic of this proposal and fully support the proposal as a means of addressing my concern relative to the area at the northernmost point of Byway 11. Such a modification would stop this area being used as a car park so as to facilitate free viewing access to the Stonehenge Monument.

(2) Even if the above proposal is adopted in co-operation with the National Trust and Wiltshire Council I have however a further concern that in my view it is reasonably foreseeable that the problem currently associated with the area adjacent to the point at which Byway 11 joins the A303 will move approximately 390 metres west to the point at which Byway 12 connects to the A303. I know the area well and I can just see the problem shifting to this particular location and that concerns me from the point of view of the prevention of future deaths as if not addressed at this point could again lead to another fatality occurring in similar circumstances following the closure of Byway 11. I heard evidence from [REDACTED] that Byway 12 is actively used as a green lane and I am fully aware that any modification to Byway 12 due to its use as a connecting green lane between the A303 and the A360 is likely to be highly controversial and political but that does not remove the concern that I have that there in my view is a reasonably foreseeable risk in the future if the terminal end of Byway 11 is closed. It is with this in mind and having considered the matter further after the inquest that I have included in the list of recipients of this Regulation 28 report, the Department of Transport and English Heritage. The reason for this is of course last year the issue of the A303 generally in this area, following the closure of the A344, has prompted a review of the highway infrastructure in this area from the point of view of diverting the A303 or indeed as regards the funding of a tunnel through which the A303 would pass underground in the vicinity of the Stonehenge Monument and I would therefore like my concerns relative to the issues raised in this report relative Byway 11 and Byway 12 south of the A303 to be taken into consideration.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,37,Male,Pedestrian

The cause of death was 1(a) septicaemia due to 1(b) perforated gangrenous cholecystitis and 2) traumatic brain injury, diabetes mellitus and HIV infection. The conclusion which was a short form was accidental death.","Maurice Camfield's medical history was that of suffering from back pain, type 2 diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

On 21 April he was involved in a road traffic collision in Bangkok whilst riding a motor cycle which caused him to suffer a traumatic brain injury. He was repatriated to the United Kingdom on 16 May 2013 whereupon he was admitted to Pinderfields General Hospital, Wakefield.

The injuries he had sustained in Bangkok were subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhages, fractured ribs, left obstructive uropathy and hydronephrosis and dilatation with linear skull fracture. He developed post injury agitation and seizure activity and he was transferred to the stroke unit where a new diagnosis of HIV was made.

Mr Camfield was deemed ready for rehabilitation and was transferred to Dewsbury District Hospital for stroke rehabilitation where his condition deteriorated. On 27 June 2013 he was transferred to the intensive care unit at Dewsbury Hospital where he developed sepsis. He required blood pressure support and inotropes and he was fed by a nasogastric tube.

On 5 July 2013 he was transferred back to Pinderfields General Hospital but became immediately unresponsive on the journey and died in the ambulance.","1. I heard evidence at this inquest from [REDACTED], a consultant in neurological rehabilitation, who expressed the view that it was important that in Mr Camfield’s case those involved in his care and treatment should do so strictly in accordance with the agreed plan, which dictated that he should have one-to-one nursing care at all times.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 March 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was road traffic collision. Gordon N Davidson’s cause of death was given as 1a) traumatic injuries related to a road traffic accident and Grant T Benson’s cause of death was given as 1a) immediate effects of fire related to a road traffic accident.",Both deceased were travelling in a motor vehicle which crashed and hit a tree. The passenger died either at the time of the collision or soon thereafter. The driver survived the initial impact and died in the ensuing fire.,"Between the time of the impact and him being incapable of further speech the driver had a conversation with an Ambulance Control call handler with a view to securing the attendance of the Emergency Services. This call lasted for several minutes and it is clear from listening to the recording how frantic the driver became as the fire began and took hold. The driver gave quite an accurate description of his approximate location to the call handler but the call handler was unable at any time during the call to accurately locate the whereabouts of the incident. Technological information given by GPS gave an inaccurate location for the incident. The emergency call was routed to Yorkshire Ambulance Service rather than to North East Ambulance Service which would have been based in Newcastle upon Tyne. The call handler with Yorkshire Ambulance Service was based in Wakefield. She had no personal knowledge of the area. Despite having a map in front of her and the assistance of two other members of staff looking over her shoulder and trying to assist it was not possible for an ambulance to be dispatched. The call handler in evidence said that she repeated certain key information to the caller but that is not recorded. She gave evidence that she would have covered the microphone to speak to colleagues in trying to locate the incident. Her evidence was inconsistent. It is accepted in evidence that an option might have been to have sought further and urgent advice from a more local agency, the North East Ambulance Trust or possibly Durham Police or Durham and Darlington Fire Rescue Service. Evidence was given that it is not possible to transfer responsibility for calls from one emergency service to another and the only means of further communication would be by telephone. The evidence was clear that in cross boundary area situations there are inadequate systems in place to secure the best possible response to an incident. It is not possible for one ambulance service to dispatch an ambulance from another ambulance service. Evidence was given that a suitable ambulance had been identified to be sent to this incident based at Richmond North Yorkshire with an estimated journey time of 28 minutes. There was an ambulance station situated in Barnard Castle (and incidentally a police station and fire station) which is only some 5 minutes or so travelling time away from the incident location. Because of the difficulties in establishing an exact location, at no time did Yorkshire Ambulance have sufficient information to despatch an ambulance. Emergency services only attended the scene of the incident once a further call had been made to the Emergency Services by a member of the public. The evidence in this case was that even if the local fire brigade had been promptly summoned, an appropriate appliance would not have reached the incident scene sufficiently quickly to have changed the outcome i.e. the death of the driver. The evidence however, reveals system shortcomings which may in other circumstances lead to avoidable deaths taking place and therefore a review by the Emergency Services of a joined up approach could be particularly useful, in addition to a comprehensive review of call handling procedures in difficult circumstances such as these.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,26,Male,Driver

Rebello,Liverpool and the Wirral,"The Chief Executive, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust","On 19 July 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Gerard McCrory, aged 50. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30 January 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was Ia multiple fractures, injuries and burns. Michael Gerard McCrory intentionally ended his own life and the cause of death was aggravated by neglect.","At approximately 10.40 on 16 July 2013 Michael Gerard McCrory died in a collision between his motor car, a Ford Ka and a tree on Lever Causeway in Bebington, Wirral. No other vehicle was involved in the collision and Michael McCrory was the sole occupant of his vehicle. It is found so as to be sure that he intended his death by his actions. The fact that this could occur ought to have been known by those caring for him, at the time, as a real and immediate risk to Michael McCrory’s life and there were failings to take steps which might have been expected to avoid that risk. Michael McCrory had suffered from a mental illness diagnosed as a Bipolar Affective Disorder since 1998, in spite of which he was a respected, high achieving professional teacher who had been stable with treatment in the community. Michael McCrory was honest, eloquent and clear in his communications with mental health professionals. He self-reported to an emergency department and was admitted to in-patient treatment on 12 January 2013 by the crisis team as a result of the manifestation of unmanageable suicidal thoughts. After 12 days he was discharged to outpatient care. He had a brief second admission from 8 to 13 February 2013 and again continued with out-patient care. His third admission was from 2 to 31 May 2013. Finally on 8 July 2013 he was admitted having presented himself at the outpatient service with an overwhelming urge to end his life. He was admitted to manage risk of suicide as a voluntary patient initially on level 2 that is 15 minute observations with only escorted absences from the unit, however the following day he was placed on level 1 - hourly observations whereby he could leave the unit with permission, the staff knowing his whereabouts when off the unit. On 13 July 2013 Michael McCrory reported to his wife, when she was visiting the unit that unbeknown to the mental health team he had left the unit taken a train from Spital Station to Eastham Rake and had considered throwing himself under a train. One reason for not doing so was out of consideration for the train driver. His wife reported this incident and these ideations to a nurse – however the fact that he had visited a train station was not understood by the mental health team - Michael McCrory was placed back on level 2 - 15 minute observations the same day. On 15 July 2013 there was an emergency multi-disciplinary meeting for which Michael McCrory had prepared a clear but concise note of his explanation of his symptoms. He significantly stated, amongst other matters, “I do not want to kill myself, but suicide is a very attractive option when feeling this awful. Therefore I would like to stay ward based until such time as I start to feel better (I know I would be kept ward based anyway)” – The professionals in the meeting did not read his communication and made a decision to reduce his observations to level 1. The reasoning for this change in observations is difficult to understand from the evidence but appears to be due to some concerns that Michael McCrory had been bored over the weekend and that the restrictions from the level 2 observations had a counter therapeutic effect giving him time to ruminate on negative thoughts. Michael McCrory’s wishes were overridden. On 16 July 2013 Michael McCrory had left the ward with permission and had drawn cash from a machine by 09.15. He had gone home taken his car and by 10.40 he had died from the effects of the collision. Given the eloquent, honest and clear communications he had with healthcare professionals though there was always a risk of a completed suicide, the long term risk of suicide could have been managed with specialist services and his support network with him receiving inpatient care as he requested when required. His death was facilitated and enabled in part by the fact that the poor state of his mental health on 15 July 2013 had not been fully appreciated, his care, treatment and supervision was not adequate and he was not listened to; in particular from the general trust of the evidence the following were all more than minimally or trivially contributory factors to a lesser or greater degree Michael McCrory’s death: a. Inadequate discharge planning and failures to refer to OT in February and June, resulting in a lost opportunity to provide an OT programme, (including documentation failing to identify a care coordinator following the 13.2.13 discharge). b. Failure to record Michael McCrory’s mobile phone number in the medical records. c. Failure to complete the doctor’s health assessment documentation and failure of the consultant to identify that this had not been done d. Inadequate medication review by reason of the failure to consider if lithium was at a therapeutic level and therefore to consider in line with NICE guidance e. Failure to consider bloods at any point during the medication review f. Failure to provide PRN medication diazepam / lorazepam – in response to Mr. McCrory’s request g. Failure to record the rationale for medication decisions and risks/ benefits h. Care plan recording that the 72 hour intervention plan was “met” when it had not been done save for one recording within a 12 hour period i. Delay in completing the care plan (12.7.13) j. Allocation of Michael McCrory as a complex patient to a “designated nurse” who was a new member of staff who had not been trained or received an induction. Inability of ward manager to identify what was mandatory training was k. Failures to update the care plan including failure of the consultant to consider the care plan and key information and failure of the ward manager to “audit” the care plan and identify that 72 hour intervention plan was not completed l. Inadequate recording [system and individual], no evidence of objective assessment of mood, depression, no documented risk assessment process in the notes in respect of risk of suicide m. Inadequate engagement with Michael McCrory to assess and consider his mood “proactively” – no staff asked at any point to consider his writings seen by him to be making to inform thoughts and feelings and risks n. Use of a system for making entries which was not covered by a policy and which encouraged a culture of limited entries in care notes which did not give a clear picture as to presentation. o. Insufficient time for staff to engage with patients to assess mood, feelings p. Failure to identify Michael had been off the ward on 12/7/13 – this failure is linked to inadequate / no systems – this failure is significant and gross and impacted significantly on the further failures and the failure to keep Michael McCrory safe q. Inadequate system of recording for level one observations and the fact that the system operated was in breach of trust policy which was within the knowledge of senior nurses/managers – there being no system to record the location or whereabouts of a patient given permission to leave the ward or the time they left – and further the policy operated breached the trust leave policy in that it permitted patients to leave the hospital. Complete lack of understanding of the therapeutic observation policy in respect of level 1 - when Michael McCrory left the ward on 16/7/13 he merely asked for his cigarettes with no enquiry as to his whereabouts thereafter r. Failure to record key information shared on 13/7/13 that Michael McCrory had been off the ward and to the train station with a plan to throw himself under a train – the full extent of the seriousness of this incident was not handed over to staff and appreciated in respect of the significant risk and had a significant impact. This was simply recorded as thoughts to throw himself under a train that had not been shared with staff – this in itself was significant information but the fuller information was essential to have been recorded, acted upon and investigated and it was not. Failure to accurately update the care plan and risk assessment on 13/7/13 and to carry out a ward based investigation by the ward manager and DATIX incident report and trust investigation as at 13.7.13 s. The mental health team being depleted at the time of ECT clinics – both 12/7/13 and 15/7/13 when Michael left the ward were ECT clinic days t. On 15/7/13 when there was an emergency multidisciplinary meeting there was a failure to invite/contact [REDACTED] and to obtain her views in respect of downgrading observations u. Failure to inform [REDACTED] that Michael was no longer ward based v. Complete disregard for the patient’s views expressed on 15/7/13 in the morning at the meeting, in the letter and at the time of the decision to downgrade, in particular by failing to read the letter brought to the meeting w. The decision to downgrade the observation was a gross failing – this caused and contributed to the death directly letting Michael off the ward when he had communicated what he would do if not ward based x. Failure to identify at the meeting that the care plan and risk assessment had not been updated with no documented risk assessment having taken place on 15/7/13 with no rationale recorded for the decision to downgrade to level 1 in the notes y. Failure to tell the patient that consideration had been given at that time by the consultant to a referral to the specialist service in Manchester in response to his documented comment “I will try anything”. This comment is also at odds with the comment that ECT did not work last time and it being documented that “would be futile” which would more likely have depressed Michael McCrory’s mood. The onus was inappropriately placed on Michael to approach staff - “Take self-responsibility” * Not revisiting the decision to downgrade to level 1 when making the entry at the end of the shift and having seen the further entries made including “immense sadness”. z. The delay in responding to Michael McCrory being missing after 9.30 on 16/7/13, by not contacting [REDACTED] earlier given the unit had failed to record Michael McCrory’s mobile phone number.","a. I report the above findings for your attention and comment with regard to action taken to prevent future deaths.

b. In addition, clear evidence was heard that though the therapeutic observation policy had been amended, the amended policy still required the whereabouts of a patient on level 1 observations to be known, but the practice was still to just record that the person was O (off the ward) as opposed to (out with permission from a specific time going to a specific location).

I determined that Mrs Moock died as a result of multiple skeletal injuries including severe head and chest injuries and Mrs Taylor died as a result of multiple skeletal injuries including severe chest injuries and a ruptured heart and that their deaths were the result of a road traffic collision.","On Saturday 28 September 2013, at approximately 10.45pm [REDACTED] was driving his Volkswagen Golf motor car northbound along the A285 from Chichester to the home address of his friends, [REDACTED] and Mrs Taylor namely [REDACTED]. They had all been to the theatre in Chichester.

[REDACTED] and Mrs Moock were guests of [REDACTED] and Mrs Taylor and had been planning to stay with them over the weekend of 28 and 29 September 2013

[REDACTED] was at the time accompanied by Mrs Janice Taylor, who was sat in the front passenger seat, [REDACTED], who was sat in the rear offside seat, and Mrs Hilary Moock who was sat in the rear nearside seat. [REDACTED] and other guests had gone in a separate car.

Travelling south on the same road and at the same time was [REDACTED] who was driving his Honda Civic motor car. The evidence he gave at the inquest was that he was driving at between 55–60 miles. The speed limit for this road was the national speed limit of 60 miles per hour. [REDACTED] admitted that he had consumed at least 1.5 pints of lager. A roadside breath test showed that his alcohol reading in breath was 21 micrograms which was within the legal limit of 35 micrograms of breath.

As [REDACTED] approached the entrance to St Mary’s Farm and Benges cottages it appears that there may have been some confusion by the occupants in the car as to exactly where the entrance was. [REDACTED] was relying on Mrs Taylor giving him instructions. The entrance is difficult to negotiate as it is close to the brow of a hill, there is no lighting and the entrance is straight onto unmade road which is full of potholes.

It appears that as [REDACTED] approached the entrance he slowed right down and then turned right and travelled across the southbound lane. As he did so he was impacted broadside (in a T-bone configuration) by [REDACTED] car which was travelling through the junction.

Tragically both Mrs Moock and Mrs Taylor sustained fatal injuries from the collision.","(1) The A285 is an ancient rural road and it does not meet the design standards of a modern road. It is noted that this road features in the list of persistently higher risk roads under the EuroRap fatal and serious collisions per kilometre travelled analysis.
(2) The location of this accident is in a dark unlit area and there is no clear indication that there is an entrance into St Mary’s Farm and Benges Cottages. This is a difficult turn to make from the northerly approach as the line of sight to the brow of the hill is only 90 metres.
(3) There is only limited amount of asphalt at the entrance into St Mary’s Farm and Benges Cottages of some 2 metres. The road then becomes “unmade” and uneven with several large potholes. It appeared from the evidence that because of this drivers are somewhat cautious when driving into the road.

Salter,Oxfordshire,"Mr Graham Dalton, Chief Executive, Highways Agency","On 26 June 2014 I opened an inquest into the death of Mr Kevin Lawrenson who was 39 years of age when he sadly died following a road traffic collision on the M40 motorway (just past Junction 6) in Oxfordshire. I concluded the inquest on 17 December 2014 at Oxford Coroner’s Court. A copy of the record of inquest is attached. It will be seen that I gave a conclusion of ‘Accident’ and made the following findings:

Kevin Lawrenson was driving his works van at approximately 18.55 hours on 18 June 2014 southbound on the M40 motorway between Junction 6 towards Junction 5 at Lewknor near Stokenchurch, Oxfordshire when he collided with the rear of a slow moving lorry in lane 1 on an incline uphill.

There was oral evidence at the inquest from 4 witnesses. This included the police collision investigator and [REDACTED] from the Traffic Management Unit of Hampshire Constabulary/Thames Valley Police Roads Policing. Additionally, I arranged for a representative from the Highways Agency to attend and give evidence. Mr Michael Freeman, departments representative, based at Bedford, gave evidence. My office provided the Highways Agency with a copy of the inquest file prior to the hearing. Consequently, I have not provided you with a copy of the file with this letter but I do attach a copy of the report of [REDACTED] collision investigator, and the report prepared by [REDACTED] dated 31 July 2014.",The circumstances are briefly set out above but are explained in more detail in the report of the Collision Investigator. Mr Lawrenson drove into the rear of a Romanian HGV as it drove very slowly (22 mph according to the tachograph) uphill in lane 1 of the M40. The collision occurred just past Junction 6. The HGV was loaded with 23 tonnes of bricks. It was not overloaded however. It is understood that the HGV was initially driving behind a recovery vehicle which was towing a vehicle and that this is also partly the reason why the HGV was driving so slowly.,"The matters of concern are in relation to slow moving vehicles at the location, signage and steps that may be possible to reduce the likelihood of a similar accident occurring in future.

It will be seen from paragraph 2.3 of [REDACTED] report that there have been a large number of similar accidents at or near this location, including 3 fatalities since 2008. It will also be seen from paragraph 3.1.1 that there are two signs prior to the location of the scene warning of slow moving vehicles. On page 10 of [REDACTED] report there is a photograph of the first of the 2 signs. It does not appear to be a very large sign; it is sited quite low down.

I heard oral evidence from Mr [REDACTED] about the system of monitoring and reporting in place and that, as recommended in the 2013 Safety Monitoring Report prepared on behalf of UK Highways Limited, a further study between junction 5 to 6 has been undertaken and a report is due to be completed very shortly. It is understood that the report is likely to outline possible improvements to signage and other steps. For example, there is the potential of increasing signage and/or making the additional signs more visible. I was told there was insufficient room in the central reservation to place a sign. I understand chevrons for lane separation is a possibility, as is an electronic sign which detects slow moving vehicles and warns other motorists.

She was hit by an articulated lorry when she attempted to cross at a pedestrian crossing.

High Bullen Road is a dual carriageway consisting of two lanes and is subject to a 30mph speed limit. The carriageway in which the collision occurred is on the approach to the traffic island at the junction with the A462. The collision occurred at a pedestrian crossing approach to the traffic island.

The type of crossing is described as a pedestrian activated, traffic light controlled puffin crossing. There is a traffic island a short distance from the crossing if a driver is heading away from the M6 motorway. It is evident that if a vehicle approaches queuing traffic, then there is a risk that it may cause confusion to pedestrians at the pelican crossing who may be tempted to cross not appreciating that the lights were against them because there is no audible sound to indicate this.

During the inquest, evidence emerged that Mrs Sheridan had pressed a button to activate the pedestrian crossing sequence. A lorry had slowed down due to the queuing traffic and that she may have misinterpreted this and crossed not realising the lights were in favour of the lorry and a collision took place.

Rose,Somerset,"Chief Executive, Network Rail","On the 4th and 5th September 2014 I held an inquest before a jury into the death of William Dennis France who died at Athelney Railway Crossing on 21 March 2013. The jury returned a narrative conclusion namely:-
“Dennis William France died on 21 March 2013 when his car was struck by a high speed train when he attempted to drive across a railway crossing at Athelney when the automatic half barriers were down.
In all probability the decision to do so was influenced by a desire to get to work on time pending his retirement and the prolonged period the barriers had been down due to an earlier movement of an engineering train.”","The circumstances were that the deceased who was on his way to work either thought that he had time to cross the main Taunton to Westbury railway line before the arrival of a train and/or the automatic half barriers had not been functioning correctly. Whilst crossing the Upline the deceased’s car was hit by a high speed train going from Exeter St Davids to Paddington at a speed of approximately 100 miles per hour. The car not being visible to the driver of the train until 1 or 2 seconds before impact.
Whilst the accident was entirely brought about by the deceased’s own actions, part of the problem was due to the automatic half barriers being down for a period between 75 and 103 seconds, instead of the normal 29 seconds. This had been caused initially by an earlier Tamper train activating the strike in treddle whilst proceeding in the wrong direction on the Upline. As the treddle only had one arm, the mechanisms had become out of synchronisation causing the barriers to come down and 4 minutes later rising again and setting signal E93 at red. At either this stage or a later testing by the signalman at Exeter led a cyclist to cross the line when the barrier was down. However the lowering of barriers prior to the deceased’s death was the result of the signalman at Exeter setting sign at E93 at green so as to clear the yellow signal UA136 prior to the arrival of the Paddington bound train.
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch prepared a very detailed report that was published on 24 February 2014 and I assume that you are in possession of a copy.","Subsequently the strike in treddle on the upline which is located 1.1 miles from the crossing has been fitted with a two armed lever which if it had been installed prior to the accident would have prevented the long delay.

There is also concern that:
(1) Motor vehicle drivers approaching the crossing from either side have to go up a rise and their visibility towards Taunton is obstructed in part by the barrier controls and the road crossing which is also at an angle.

He was taken by ambulance to Milton Keynes Hospital where the serious nature of his injuries were not recognised; there was a failure to adequately monitor his condition and a failure to escalate his care for a senior review resulting in a series of lost opportunities to render further medical attention and he died on 3 April 2013 from haemothorax.

On the 20 November 2009 the inquest into the death of Robert John Graham was opened by Dr Robert Hunter HM Coroner for Derbyshire and on the 19 November 2009 the inquest into the death of Richard Alan Barker was opened James Nigel Anderson (Deputy Coroner). I was ordered by the Chief Coroner of England and Wales to assume jurisdiction of these matters and continue the investigations by order dated the 4 April 2014. The investigations concluded on the 27 August 2014 and the conclusion in each case was one of Accidental Death. The medical causes of death were as follows:-

Richard Alan Barker: 1a Cervical vertebral complete dislocation with cord transection.

Ryan Reece Bramwell: 1a Multiple trauma
1b Road Traffic Accident

Robert John Graham: 1a Multiple soft tissue and bony injuries","On 13 November 2009 Robert Graham was driving his Ford Mondeo motor car along the A619 from the Chesterfield direction towards Baslow. As he was proceeding up what is known as Chandler Hill, his car was struck by an out of control Mercedes coming down the hill in the opposite direction, which had aquaplaned on an excessive amount of water on the carriageway.
The following day at the same location a line of cars was proceeding from the Chesterfield direction towards Baslow when a Ford Escort RS 2000 overtook them at speed and in so doing it aquaplaned, crossed the centre of the carriageways and collided with an oncoming ambulance before careering down an embankment and into some trees. Two of the occupants of the Ford Escort were killed.","(A) Both the Mercedes vehicle involved in the first collision and the Ford Escort involved in the second collision had tyres which met the requirements for the minimum amount of tread depth, but the rear tyres had considerably less tread depth than those on the front. Evidence was given by the expert vehicle examiners and police accident investigators, that this arrangement with the ‘better’ tyres to the front, is undesirable and did contribute to the effects of aquaplaning and loss of control in each case. It occurred to me that at the very least strong advice by tyre fitters should be given to any driver seeking to have the better tyres placed on the front, and preferably it should be made a legal requirement.

1a – Medullary transection
1b – Fracture of the cervical spine

The jury returned a narrative conclusion:

On 21 February 2013 Mr. Friend died as a result of a road traffic collision on the A217 Dovers Green Road. On the balance of probabilities the manner in which the motorcycle was ridden was one of three material contributions to his death. The other material factors that contributed to his death were the positioning of the lights and signs associated with the road works and risk assessments carried out by Sutton and East Surrey Water PLC were inadequate. Finally, the conduct of Surrey Police following attendance at a road traffic collision on 20 February 2013 involving the inadequacy or otherwise of Surrey Police’s assessment, response and failure to identify risk to life following the incident on 20 February 2013.","On 20 February 2013 Sutton and East Surrey Water placed road works and a two-way traffic light system beyond what was described as a blind bend. The placing of the lights meant that traffic held by the lights backed up towards the blind bend. A member of the public expressed concerns to the Council that same morning about the proximity of the lights to the bend. That afternoon there was a road traffic collision at the location, which was attended by Police. Despite having concerns over safety to the public the Officer attending did not report these concerns to the relevant authority. The following morning (21 February 2013) there was a similar road traffic collision at the same place. As a result the traffic was stationary just beyond the blind bend. Mr Friend, a motorcyclist travelling at speed, negotiated the bend and collided with one of the stationary cars before being projected into the path of an oncoming car thereby sustaining the injuries from which he died.","1.

Further, guidance or training should be provided to operatives as to placing traffic lights near to blind bends or where waiting traffic will encroach upon blind bends.

2. Action is required by Surrey Police to formulate a clear policy/protocol for all officers to follow when they identify a risk created to the public by road works which should include a clear route to allow them to locate who is responsible for the placing of the road works if no apologies board is seen/present.

3. Action is required by Reigate and Banstead Council to ensure that any calls from members of the public to the council about serious safety issues relating to the road network are passed directly to those with responsibility to take action.

Salter,Oxfordshire,"Ms Suzette Davenport, Chief Constable, Gloucestershire Constabulary","On the 14 October 2013 I opened an inquest into the death of Suzanne Cammell, aged 71, who died on 3 October 2013 at a layby on the A361 near Burford Golf Club. I concluded the case at inquest on 16 July 2014 at Oxford Coroner’s Court. A copy of the record of inquest is attached. It will be seen that I gave a conclusion of suicide and stated that…

""At approximately 06.00-07.00 hours on 3 October 2013 Suzanne Cammell lay underneath the wheels of a lorry trailer parked in a layby on the A361 near Burford Golf Club and was killed instantly when the lorry drove off at approximately 07.00 hours.""

An investigation was initially carried out by TVP and a file of papers was submitted to me. There was oral evidence from [REDACTED] of Gloucestershire Constabulary, TVP officers and from mental health professionals.","At approximately 01.20 hours on 3 October 2013 a call was made to TVP by the owner of a kebab van situated in the layby on the A361 near Burford Golf Club. He reported that he was concerned about a woman in the layby (Suzanne Cammell) who was seen lying or trying to lie under a lorry parked in the layby to go to sleep. He went on to say that he woke her up when he saw her under the lorry as he was concerned she may get run over in the morning.

TVP Officers attended. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] took Ms Cammell and her vehicle back to her home in Lechlade. They left her at her home address at approximately 02.20. There was communication between TVP and Gloucestershire Constabulary and at about 03.30 [REDACTED] and another Gloucestershire Officer attended and spoke to Ms Cammell at her home to check on her welfare. The Gloucestershire Officers then left.

According to CCTV footage at Burford Golf Club, it appears that Ms Cammell returned and parked her car up in the grounds of the Golf Club at approximately 05.30. At 07.00 hours the lorry in the layby (the only one parked there overnight) drove off. Ms Cammell appears to have been lying underneath the wheels of the lorry and sustained devastating crush injuries to her head, chest and abdomen. The medical cause of death from the Pathologist, [REDACTED], was severe blunt head injuries.","(1) There was also an incident on 23 September 2013 in Gloucestershire when Ms Cammell had been sectioned under Section 136 of the MHA because she had been seen placing her head under the wheels of a recycling lorry where she lived. She was seen by neighbours and/or the driver in time.

This information about the incident on 23 September 2013 was held on the Police National Database which, presumably, Gloucestershire control and [REDACTED] would have had access to.

The concern therefore is in relation to communication between TVP and Gloucestershire Constabulary and, in turn, communication between Gloucestershire control and its officers. At inquest, I did not have available to me details of the specific information passed by TVP control to Gloucestershire control in the early hours which subsequently led to [REDACTED] and his colleague carrying out the welfare check at approximately 03.30. The evidence of [REDACTED] at inquest is that he did not know that she had been found lying underneath the wheels of the lorry earlier in the morning. He gave evidence that, if he had known this, he would have put in hand arrangements for a MHA assessment.

[REDACTED] also gave evidence that he did not know about the previous similar incident on 23 September despite the fact that it was on the PND and, furthermore, on Gloucestershire’s “Unify” intelligence database.

The issue of concern therefore is the fact that specific information, of a high risk nature, was not or may not have been passed by TVP to Gloucestershire Constabulary or, if it was, it may not have been available to [REDACTED].

Bedford,Berkshire,Bracknell Forest Borough Council; Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation,On 9 October 2012 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Arthur Warren. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10 July 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative as attached.,Michael Arthur Warren died from serious head injuries suffered when the car he was driving was struck on its roof by the large branch of a mature oak tree that unexpectedly fell without warning as he drove beneath it on 5 October 2012.,"(1) The evidence at the inquest revealed that Bracknell Forest Borough Council employ highways inspectors to carry out driven and walked inspections in order to attempt to identify any potential hazards that might impact adversely on road users.
(2) The highway inspectors were expected to identify a range of potential problems including potholes in the road, damaged or obscured signage and potential hazards from trees abutting the highway which were often of considerable height. There was little by way of guidance given to highways inspectors who had developed their own system of drive-by investigations conducted at a speed rarely less than thirty miles per hour.
(3) The evidence highlighted the limited nature of training provided to highway inspectors in identifying potential hazards from trees. The two inspectors who conducted a drive-by survey two days before the branch fell and killed Mr Warren and who had noted nothing of concern, had not completed any form of tree training since a two day course some seven years earlier. Another highway inspector who gave evidence at the inquest, had never attended a formal training course with regard to tree hazards.
(4) There is therefore a need for appropriate guidelines to be provided by Bracknell Forest Council to highway inspectors to ensure that they are properly trained in tree issues; that they have an appropriate system of work that ensures that they drive at a speed appropriate to maximise the chances of identifying tree hazards and that there should be a series of inspections which are limited to only the inspection of trees.
(5) The evidence also revealed that there was very little by way of clear, detailed guidance available to local authorities as regards the appropriate systems of highway inspection of trees abutting the highway. There is a potential need for clear direction from a suitably qualified source to assist local authorities in this crucial role.
(6) The owner of the land on which the relevant oak tree stood lived abroad and had no arrangements for professional review of the trees on his property, in particular those that were close to the highway and therefore a potential hazard to road users. It was of concern that the lack of active management of the owner’s land continued some two and a half years after Mr Warren’s death.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Driver

The inquest was concluded on 7 May 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was open, the medical cause of death being multiple injuries.",Stuart Long was a pedestrian on the A30 eastbound lane just past Launceston when he was seen to step/run out into the carriageway at around 05:50 on 22 December 2013. He was struck by a Peugeot Boxer van registration number [REDACTED] resulting in him lying prone on the road carriageway. He was run over/hit by at least three other vehicles that did not see him or were unable to avoid him in the road. As a result he received fatal non-survivable injuries. He had been seen stepping/running out in front of vehicles earlier that morning. He suffered from low mood/anxiety/alcohol misuse and had told health professionals he had thoughts of self-harm by stepping out in front of vehicles/trains. He had been removed from his home address in Launceston by the police earlier that morning due to being drunk (212 mg/100 post mortem blood alcohol) and being aggressive to another. He was known to have mental health issues after using alcohol by front line workers,"In the early hours of the morning of his death, Mr Long was removed by police from his home address due to inappropriate behaviour (involving a vulnerable adult) while in drink. Mr Long had long-term mental health issues and misused alcohol and was known to behave inappropriately when both of these issues deteriorated. On this occasion he was seen by members of the public to be jumping in front of cars. This behaviour was known to the mental health professional who worked with him.

It appeared from the inquest that there was some confusion as to how to appropriately deal with anti-social behaviour when someone was in drink/mentally unwell.

The cause of death following post mortem examination was that of 1a) Multi-organ injury. I finalised the inquest on 25 June 2014 with a conclusion of 'Road Traffic Collision'.,A combination of inexperience and excessive speed contributed to the driver losing control of a motor vehicle which was being driven in lane 2 of 2 on the A627(M) whereupon the vehicle rotated anti-clockwise through 90 degrees as it crossed lane 1 and mounted the embankment to the nearside where the rear offside of the vehicle collided with a tree which impact resulted in the vehicle rolling up onto the tree and rotating clockwise through 180 degrees before coming to rest.,"1. The section of the A627(M) where this incident occurred forms the south bank carriageway of the motorway, approaching Junction 1 at Chadderton, Oldham. The A627(M) is a two lane, dual carriageway and is subject to motorway regulations including the national (70 miles per hour) speed restriction.

2. The introduction of the interim requirements for road restraint systems in 2002 identified that all trees with a girth exceeding 500mm (or several closely spaced trees) located within a distance of 4.5m from the paved carriageway require protection. The re-issued requirements in 2004 identified that trees above 300mm in girth should be protected by a suitable vehicle restraint system.

3. Current design standard TD19/06 includes a site specific risk process where topographical features, together with adjacent sources of risk are reviewed in order to identify the most appropriate restraint facility and containment levels and that in relation to the presence of trees adjacent to the nearside verge and protection requirements, it is unclear as to when these germinated and it is likely that they are all 'self-seeded' with the larger specimens being over 10 years old. Whilst the vehicle restraint systems in place comply with identified requirements at the time of the construction of the route, there are no current requirements to inspect soft estate as it develops in terms of assessing protection requirements. The application of more recent design standards would have required some of the trees at this location to be protected (as well as the lighting columns) or removed within the 4.5m threshold.

This sudden braking caused Mrs Naylor to be projected forward from a designated priority seat into the wheelchair / tip-up bay. The traumatic injury she sustained as a result of the impact caused her death which could have possibly been prevented if some other safety measure had been fitted which may have restricted Mrs Naylor's movement. Mrs Naylor's death was confirmed at The Royal Oldham Hospital on 19 November 2011 at 17:45.",,"I. The vehicle in question is double deck Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 owned by Stagecoach of which at least 900 are still in use within the UK.

II. The vehicle is required to have a minimum of 4 priority seats to allow access for disabled people and that can be accessed from the flat floor area of the vehicle, thus avoiding the passenger having to negotiate unnecessary steps. A priority seat has to be as close as practical to the priority entrance and such seats must have a clear area in front of the seat to allow passengers' feet to be placed at least 230mm before the start of a minimum clear space of 1300mm to facilitate the carriage of wheelchair users (Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000).

III. Regulations make no mandate for a screen / barrier to be present in front of such a priority seat.

IV. As standing passengers are carried on this vehicle, seat belts are not mandatory although this would not preclude the fitment of a seat belt as an option. However, a seat belt could only be fitted if there was sufficient anchorage and the seat itself would have to undergo a 'pull' test. The priority seat in question would not, it is believed, comply with the 'pull' test.

V. Notwithstanding the fact that Mrs Naylor was a very fit and active 79 year old. She was propelled across a void of 184cm before sustaining injuries which crushed her upper spinal cord causing immediate unconsciousness and paralysis.

The cause of death was:

1.a. Head injury consistent with being sustained in a road traffic collision

The conclusion was:

Accidental death as a result of a motor collision.","On 5 May 2013 Mr Devereux was driving his Mini Cooper S motor car in a race at the Donington circuit in Leicestershire when his car was in a frontal collision with a Ford Mustang. As a result of the collision Mr Devereux suffered head injuries from which he died at the scene.

The evidence of the Consultant Forensic Pathologist was that Mr Devereux had suffered (amongst other injuries):

a) A linear skull fracture across the base of the skull which had almost connected to become circumferential.
b) A fracture of the left transverse process of the lower cervical spine over the course of the left vertebral artery
c) The skull fracture and associated bleeding over the base of the skull will have resulted in sudden disruption of electrical signals from the brain to the rest of the body. This is likely to have resulted in almost instantaneous death.

Mr Devereux was wearing a full racing harness and a helmet, and was sitting in an approved racing seat, which had head height “wings” to reduce sideways head movement.

There was little internal intrusion of damage into the car itself. The damage to the Mini was to the nearside front.","(1) During the collision between the Mini and the Mustang Mr Devereux would have suffered a major movement of his head in a forwards and backwards motion.

(2) It is likely that his head and neck would have suffered an extension and a turning motion as his car spun

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 March 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was that the medical cause of death was 1(a) chest injuries and the short-form conclusion was that the death was due a 'road traffic collision'.,"The circumstances of Miss Richard's death was that on 2 November 2013 she was driving her Ford Ka [REDACTED] south along the A46 between Nimlet and Bath. She was alone in the car at the time. As she was negotiating a left hand bend in the section of the A46 known as the 'Hartley Bends' she lost control of her vehicle and crossed over into the opposing carriageway. At the same time a Range Rover was travelling in the opposite direction and was unable to avoid the oncoming Ford Ka. A collision occurred between the two vehicles and as a result of the collision Miss Richard received injuries from which she died at the scene. She was pronounced dead at 10:00 hours. The driver of the Range Rover was physically uninjured.

During the inquest I heard evidence from witnesses to the collision as well as from PC [REDACTED] of the Collision Investigation Unit, Avon & Somerset Constabulary who conducted the collision investigation. In evidence I heard that the weather at the time of collision was overcast and dull. The road surface which was in a good state of repair was wet although it was not raining. There was no evidence to indicate that Miss Richard was travelling in excess of the prescribed maximum speed limit of 60 mph at the time of, or before, the collision.

The Ford Ka was examined by a specialist vehicle examiner of the Collision Investigation Unit who reported that both the front tyres and the rear offside tyre were worn on the inner tread below the legal limit. It was also reported that the tyres were under inflated with pressures of around 50% of the recommended pressure. There were no other defects identified in the vehicle. I found that the condition of the tyres made a significant contribution to causation of the collision in combination with the speed of the vehicle and the inexperience of the driver.","(1) Notwithstanding the contribution made to this collision by the condition of the tyres of Ford Ka, this is the second inquest I have conducted within the past 12 months into the death of a driver who lost control of their vehicle on the same section of the A46.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 April 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative verdict as follows:

“Muriel Dawson suffered an injury to her spine, fracturing her lumbar vertebrae L1/2, as the result of her being thrown forward from her seat in an Optare 25/28 seater public service vehicle travelling at under 20 miles per hour which braked suddenly to avoid the possibility of contact with a car preparing to enter into the roadway from a private drive. She had been seated in an aisle seat towards the front of the vehicle with nothing to restrain her forward movement. No seat belt was fitted to her seat. Other passengers in the bus were also thrown from their seats but did not suffer serious injury. The fracture of her vertebrae and associated trauma led to her death shortly after the incident”,

the cause of death being 1(a) Complete fracture lumbar vertebra (L1/2) due to 1 (b) Osteoporosis.",,"(1) My findings were, as summarised in the narrative conclusion, that Muriel Dawson was travelling on an Optare “hopper” type scheduled service bus (narrow model) and the evidence to the Coroner’s court indicated that the profile of passengers on such a vehicle would overwhelmingly be elderly. The evidence given was to the effect that the design of the vehicle provides a compromise between safety and convenience as it allows for standing passengers, seated passengers and provision for a wheelchair. The design is such that the seat in which Mrs. Dawson was seated at the time of the incident has no form of restraint should there be a violent forward motion exerted on passengers, eg. by an emergency stop. The seat position (viewed from the front facing back) is on the right hand side and is in the third row. It is the aisle seat of the first double seats, the two rows in front being single seats on that side.

(2) It is understood that these vehicles are type-approved and the operator has not made modifications to them and thus the original design and approval of the vehicle is universally that which is in regular use. Seat belts are not required to be fitted to any seats.

(3) The evidence to the inquest was that this vehicle had to stop suddenly; the brakes were correctly applied, but there was nothing to prevent Mrs. Dawson being thrown forward and she lost her life as a result of hitting the front panel of the bus having slid the remaining length of the vehicle. Her death was due to the impact with the vehicle fracturing her spine.

(4) It appeared from evidence that, still consistent with convenience, disabled access and gangway width, a floor to ceiling pole with horizontal bar, or some similar restraining construction could have been applied to the area immediately in front of her seat.

(5) It is appreciated that the backs of seats, bars and similar elements of the interior of a vehicle can cause injury in the event of a sudden stop, but I considered, based on the evidence given, that some similar design feature of the vehicle as mentioned in (4) above could, and probably would, have prevented Mrs. Dawson being thrown forward for such distance and with such momentum as to cause her death.

(6) It appears from the evidence, albeit indirectly reported to the Coroner at the inquest, that other operators have expressed concerns with the current design, but feel there is nothing they can do in a type-approved vehicle. I am concerned that the type-approval has given insufficient weight to the risk of death or serious injury.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,90,Female,Other

The conclusion of the inquest was the medical cause of death was: 1a Chest and pelvic injuries sustained in a road traffic collision. The conclusion was road traffic collision.","The junction of Troon Way and Nicklaus Road, in Leicester, was altered in 2013, with the works being completed and the new junction operational on 25 November 2013.

Paul Millis was travelling in a westerly direction on Troon Way, having finished work nearby at 2200 hours. He was travelling home, and continued through the junction in that westerly direction, riding a motorbike.

As he went through the junction he was in the outer of the two lanes that progress on Troon Way. A motor car was ahead of him in the inner lane. When the two lanes merged Mr Millis has tried to either continue to overtake the car, or has started to overtake it. He travelled onto the opposing carriageway and struck a car in that carriageway head on.

The merger of the 2 lanes occurs within a very short distance of the junction: approximately 35 metres. The process of merger by the 2 lanes is that the traffic moves in opposite directions – i.e. the inner lane moves to the right, thereby avoiding the verge, and the outer lane is directed by arrows to the left.

2. The westbound carriageway merges as described, and then as a single lane continues to the right until it straightens out into a single carriageway adjoining the eastbound traffic. The joining of the two flows of traffic occurs only 90 metres after the junction described above.

3. The situation described in 2 above means that any vehicle either behind another vehicle, or even beside it, will have a very delayed line of sight for traffic travelling eastbound, and likewise applies to eastbound traffic’s line of sight to a vehicle behind a first vehicle travelling westbound.

At the time of the incident the bus was travelling at a speed of approximately 20 miles an hour and the motorcycle at a speed of approximately 28 miles an hour.

On the day in question the Duty Manager believed that weather temperatures would increase in a relatively short period of time whereas in reality they did not do so. There were a high number of collision incidents reported to the police that morning some of which resulted in report being made to the County Council. Some gritting/salting vehicles were deployed. It will take about an hour for gritting/salting lorries to be able to commence their work and a route would take up to three hours to complete. The time that it therefore takes to complete a gritting/salting run is a factor which is considered by the Duty Manager on the question of whether to deploy or not in conjunction with the weather condition reports and as a result of information gleaned from road temperature monitoring. It was said that this procedure had been in place for many years and was tried and tested. A Regulation 28 report is being sent to Durham Constabulary and a copy provided to the local authority herewith and the evidence indicates that a better collective sharing of information between the two organisations may well be of benefit together with a review of the County Council’s own practices and procedures to ensure that a timely and proportionate response to potentially dangerous road conditions can be delivered to promote the safety of all road users. The Highways Manager indicated that with the information that the Duty Manager had following receipt of the 6.00 a.m. weather report his decision not to deploy gritting/salting vehicles was a reasonable one but that with the benefit of hindsight knowing what happened with regard to ambient temperature conditions and incidents around the county on the road network this decision was regrettable.

He was in generally good health for his age.

On 22 October 2013, at about 8.30 a.m. he was driving his car, a blue Ford Fiesta, along the Middle Road, Isle of Wight, in an easterly direction towards Newport. He was following behind a car which was following behind a single decker coach which was on a school run.

The road was subject to the national speed limit and is a single carriageway. Evidential accounts about the weather at the time varied, but it started to rain around the time of the collision. Visibility was good.

The car immediately in front of Mr Watson pulled out and overtook the coach safely and without incident.

As the coach indicated and began to slow down to collect a pupil waiting at a bus-stop, Mr Watson edged out to see if it was safe to overtake the coach. Initially it was unsafe, and he pulled back in behind the coach.

As the coach was almost at the bus-stop, Mr Watson pulled out from behind the coach to overtake it. Witnesses did not recall seeing his offside indicator being used.

Carney,Gateshead and South Tyneside,"Chief Constable, Northumbria Police; Independent Police Complaints Commission","On 11 January 2012 I commenced an investigation into the death of Vincent Gibson, aged 50 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 February 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was the deceased died from multiple injuries sustained in a road traffic incident on Whiteleas Way, South Shields on 7 January 2012 as a consequence of a collision with an emergency vehicle travelling in response to a Grade 1 incident.","The deceased in the course of crossing Whiteleas Way, South Shields was struck by a police vehicle travelling at speed with audible warning and lights activated and responding to an emergency call identified as an imminent danger to life and graded accordingly. The deceased fatally suffered multiple injuries.","1. The matters of concern identified by this history centre on an all too apparent lack of co-ordination of the essential elements of management, monitoring and control needed to effectively respond as one would reasonably expect to a properly identified and graded serious incident.
2. The caller using his mobile telephone contacted the 999 operator seeking assistance. That call was properly transferred to the Police and received by [REDACTED] a trained call taker. She identified the matter for what it was an apparent danger to life and graded it accordingly.
3. She logged the incident and despite the reticence of the caller to identify himself or his whereabouts she traced and identified him through his phone to an earlier communication by that phone and through that earlier incident identified the caller and his apparent address. The log she prepared was based on this address. She was told by him he was not there. He was in fact saying he was on his back, looking at the moon in a field. She dutifully recorded that.
4. The log was raised on the identified home address – because technically it had to be raised on an address otherwise it would technically have to be initially raised on the actual communication department itself.
5. The address became accordingly the focus of and simply put the only obvious starting point for an investigation in the mind of the participants. The fact that he was saying he was in a field was noted but not prioritised in any way at that stage as a basis of a plan to find the man. The log once created and with all this essential information on it was passed to the Resource Controller for allocation of Police Officers and resolution of the incident.
6. Much more significant than all the other facts which appeared on this log directly was the omission of the fact at any stage before the incident of the collision that [REDACTED] was in continued conversation with the caller.
7. [REDACTED] was in the same room as [REDACTED] and if [REDACTED] had known of the continuing conversation one assumes, she could have planned accordingly. [REDACTED] clearly appreciated that contact with the caller was an essential way of trying to find out more positive information about him and effectively plan for his help and support.
8. As the Resource Controller and the recipient of the initial log and graded incident she is the obvious point of direct contact for such essential detail. She is also the obvious conduit for not only the fact that the caller is still talking to the Call Taker but to understand the tone and content of that conversation and analyse the level of distress if any, the caller is continuing to demonstrate.
9. If she is unable to personally evaluate it, others within a supervisory capacity should have been able to do so and to act and plan accordingly.
10. It is of primary importance to keep the grading of the incident under review and that with the benefit of essential and relevant information. Similarly the allocation of resource and the tasking of that resource again demands relevant and essential information sufficient to ensure the effective and safe discharge of and completion of, the task in hand.
11. The two crews were ignorant of both source and content of such essential and relevant information and were being asked to risk assess a task in the absence of such essential relevant and critical information. With that critical information available to them they would be in a better position to determine more safely the speed of approach to the task - which they essentially perceived was to visit a house where the caller was believed to be but was not.
12. If Acting Sergeant Robinson had as tasked been able to speak to the caller, he would have been able to advise the travelling Officers and instruct them accordingly.
13. It is not clear that either [REDACTED] or Acting Sergeant Robinson was:
a) Aware of his or her role
b) Nor does it appear others were clear as to the role of the Sergeant or the resource controller.
c) It is not clear that either of these individuals had a clearly defined role prior to this night in the managing, monitoring or controlling of this incident.
Whatever the roles of these individuals was - whether they were joint or mutually exclusive, that role - their roles - was an essential to the discharge of this grade 1 incident safely and effectively.
As far as Sergeant Robinson was concerned, I am of a view that he was not the manager of this matter. He was not in a position to control or effectively monitor events.
14. That failure to clearly define an identifiable role and consequential confusion over roles, add to a lack of clarity and lead to a lack of effective co-ordination of the essential tasks set within this matter.

THIS INQUIRY
This Inquiry has not been directed towards the preventing or inhibiting the ability of the responding of emergency vehicles at speeds to life threatening events (i.e. Grade 1 incidents) but has sought to examine how the management monitoring and control of such incidents is co-ordinated and that in a way which reflects the commendable observation on the Code of Practice for Drivers of Vehicles Used for Police Purposes issued by Northumbria Police which states “no emergency is so great as to justify an accident”

THE QUESTIONS AND ISSUES UNDERLYING CONCERNS
1. Who was in charge of this incident and its development from its inception?
2. Was it the communication room staff? And if so, which member of that staff was in charge.
3. Was it the sector's supervisor? And if so, what information did he have to make essential and basic judgements on,
a) Appropriateness of the grading
b) The continued urgency of the situation
c) Plan a response
d) Effectively identify the nature of that response
e) Maintaining a risk analysis which reflected at all times on the safety of (i) the caller (ii) the safety of deployed crews (iii) the nature of the response and safety of members of the public who may with reasonable and thoughtful insight be identified as being caught up in the response.
4. The communication staff are the primary source of incoming and outgoing information. They are in a pivotal position which lends them to the management, monitoring and control of an incident from its inception to its conclusion. They need to be effectively resourced both as to trained personnel and equipment.
5. Rules of practice, i.e. protocols need to be clear and unequivocal identifying robust rules of procedure identifiable lines of communication where appropriate but at all stages in the identifying of the individual in the management, monitoring and control of an incident who can be properly identified as in charge of the incident in hand.
6. Training is important as is experience and practice but it should never be a presumption or presented as an excuse for a lack of clear and unequivocal instruction and good information, on the day and in specific response to a specific incident.
7. Identifying an allocation of resource should not be a spontaneous response to a demand but a reasoned and considered response to effective planning and to positive resource evaluation.
a. Self-selection borne of enthusiasm and worse, boredom does not make for a balanced plan and safe approach to a critical incident. Officers in this case were able simply to call in, identify themselves as available and willing.
b. The resource controller although she had an electronic map which could identify the whereabouts of resource did not use that map it falling out of favour and being judged not fit for purpose. Accordingly, at no stage was any resource identified even if it was available at a closer proximity.
c. Staff must be confident in the electronic aids given to them.
d. They must be effectively trained in them and those aids and their accuracy and effectiveness constantly under review.
e. It is understood that at the time of this incident whilst the map was judged to be not fit for purpose, its replacement was under review, nothing appeared to be in place to readily identify the shortcomings of the map.
8. It is difficult to judge what is worse, having an ineffective tool or no tool at all and in the absence of a tool, having no effective backup or resource management.
9. Electronic aids are a benefit not only to Central Control but also to responders and such electronic aids should eliminate any issue or debate around the fact as to route and leave the crew speculating as to the position, route or speed.
10. Electronic aids should (a) readily identify the location (b) pre-plan the route (c) determine a safe and where appropriate speedy passage. In any event, any electronic aids and/or systems must be fully integrated being identified for the purpose they are intended to serve.
11. Speed was a central issue in this matter.
a. Speed as an important element appears to have been borne of a conflict of notions within the mind of crew members as to what was required by way of a response time to this Grade 1 incident.
b. The Officers' view was that speed was dictated by a need to reach the destination as soon as possible and in any event within 10 minutes. Senior Managers however highlight that the time 10 minutes was a performance indicator, utilised subsequent to the incident to evaluate the effectiveness of the response and consequently the service given to the public.
c. It was not to be perceived as a “pressure” on the crews to respond at speed.
12. Such an apparent conflict of understanding of what that time response meant or means when attached to a grade 1 incident or indeed a grade 2, or any of the other five graded responses underlines an essential need for this process to be taken into some effective control and to be the subject of particular training and clear understanding on the part of both management and staff.

CONCLUSION
It was stated in evidence and it is readily acknowledged that when a person’s life is at risk it is a matter of professional pride to go to the aid of that individual as quickly and effectively and as safely as possible.
It is a matter of pride not only for the individual but as a service as a whole.
1. These laudable aims can be achieved with the benefit of effective management, monitoring and control and now on the basis of evidence given with the availability of electronic aids which are available.
What is not good practice and gives rise to concern is the apparent over-reliance on presumed skill sets from periods of training and years of experience and dare one say, a successful completion of a number of incidents without any apparent failing. Each incident merits appropriate levels of individual management, monitoring and control.
2. Between 10 and 12 years ago, Hospital Trusts were encouraged to engage in a transparent review of any sudden untoward incident which may occur within their establishments. Some are better at this than others but the best readily embraced the principle of early internal investigation, the identifying of the facts and witnesses and as part of the process to determining what went right and what went wrong.
Out of that process comes a meeting to identify and plan for the implementation of lessons learnt. Government has indeed only recently encouraged health services to be even more transparent in their public dealings. It is a matter of some concern that this is not an apparent practice of the Police Service even though they have a Professional Standards Department, which is clearly designed to address and respond to issues around Professional Standards and that not only in an objective but effective way.
3. There was an independent investigation carried out by the IPCC with the Durham and Cleveland Force dealing with the Road Traffic aspect of this collision. The management monitoring and control of this incident was it would appear to have been the subject as a reference at one stage which were not embraced or subsequently fulfilled. It is my view that this was a missed opportunity and it is noted that the Force’s representative at the Inquest in response to the evidence of the IPCC investigator [REDACTED] invited any observations the Commission might have out of which learning could possibly be gained.
4. It is my hope that the IPCC will review the evidence in this matter and this Regulation 28 report and call upon their experiences of other enquiries of a similar nature and advance to Northumbria Police the benefit of such learning as may be appropriate.
5. It has to be acknowledged that one of the witnesses at this hearing, Detective Chief Superintendent [REDACTED] clearly indicated that a number of lessons have been learned and actions undertaken, around issues and factors reflected on since this incident and the preparations for this Inquest process. It would be useful to note in a coherent and detailed way, exactly what has been achieved to date and is yet still planned but will ultimately be implemented.",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,50,Male,Pedestrian

Ellery,"Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin","Product Marketing Manager – Harvesting, AGCO Ltd",On 19 September 2012 I opened an inquest into the death of Valerie Anne Hancox aged 67 years. I adjourned that inquest under the then Coroners Act 1988 provisions to await the conclusion of criminal proceedings taken against the driver of a tractor which had been towing a baler. Those criminal proceedings concluded at the Crown Court at Shrewsbury on 24 February 2014 when the driver concerned was convicted of causing death by careless driving and was sentenced. Following notification of the conclusion of the criminal proceedings I was satisfied that the circumstances as to how the deceased came by her death had been established and did not resume the inquest. I have notified the Registrar accordingly. I was though notified of concerns by the investigating officer as to the lack of markings on the baler which may have contributed to the collision and having considered those concerns I consider that a formal report is required with a view to preventing future deaths.,"On 14 September 2012 on the A5 at Burlington, Shifnal, Shropshire a collision occurred between 2 vehicles, a motor car driven by the husband of the deceased and a Fendt tractor towing a Massey Ferguson 2190 baler. The collision occurred during the hours of darkness and lighting would have been required. The tractor and baler driven by the defendant pulled off the A5 at Burlington where he intended to turn left off the road and into a field to continue baling. As he pulled the large combination of equipment off the road he was faced with 2 gates. The first nearest the road being open but the second was closed and opening towards him. At this point the tractor was stopped and the baler, in particular the chute, was left blocking the oncoming car's carriageway. The car driver was completely unaware of the blockage. He did not see the bale chute prior to the collision and his wife died from the injuries sustained.","(1) The bale chute, when on the public highway, should not be in its lowered position. However, it appears to be standard farm practice to leave the bale chute down when moving from one field to another along or to cross a public highway.

(2) The bale chute was just short of 2 metres in length and falls under the legislation that, when on roads, it should be clearly marked. If it were over 2 metres then it would have to be lit.

(3) The bale chute had no markings and was painted matt grey. The manufacturers state in their handbook that the chute should be stored in the up position for travel on roads. This may explain why there is no marking but relies on the driver adhering to that instruction.

(4) Given the potential for obstructing the highway, all the more so as the manufacturer's instructions appear to be not followed, bale chutes should be clearly marked so that anyone approaching side on, day or night, as the deceased's husband was, should be able to see it.",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,67,Female,Other

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 March 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was accidental death - on 24 October 2013 Gavin Anthony Roberts was riding his motorcycle along Hollings Lane only days after having passed his test. Significantly underinflated tyres were a major factor in loss of control of his motorcycle which led to a fatal collision with an oncoming vehicle. The medical cause of death was 1a) traumatic cerebral and multi-organ injuries and fractures, 1b) road traffic collision.","Gavin Anthony Roberts was travelling along Hollings Lane in the direction of Thrybergh on his motorcycle. The road narrows to a bridge on the Hollings Road prior to which the road first bends slightly to the right before straightening and bending to the left. Visibility of oncoming vehicles on the approach to the bridge is extremely restricted due to the high walls and fencing of the bridge, hedging and the bends in the road. Mr Roberts had completed an overtaking manoeuvre on the approach to the bridge, lost control on the left hand bend and came off his motorcycle directly into the path of an oncoming vehicle, the driver of which had no prior warning of the presence of Mr Roberts on the road due to the limited visibility described. Shortly prior to the bridge in both directions the speed limit increases from 40 to 60 miles per hour. There are street lights along this stretch albeit more than 187 metres apart. Although under inflated tyres on the motorcycle was a significant factor in these events, the collision investigator gave evidence that he had calculated that the maximum speed at which the bend can be safely negotiated is 48 miles per hour (despite there being a 60 mile per hour speed restriction in place). Despite warning signs with ‘slow’ painted on the road and warning signs on the approach to the bridge in each direction, there have been 25 collisions at this location in the last 5 years.","(1) The current speed restriction of 60 mph is higher than the maximum speed at which the bend can safely be negotiated.

Persaud,London East,"Cheryl Coppell, Chief Executive, London Borough of Havering",On 1 July 2013 an investigation was commenced into the death of Stephen Michael Tilbury. On 5 July 2013 an investigation was commenced into the death of Lauren Marie Brown. These deaths arose from the same facts. The investigations concluded at the end of the inquests which took place on 7 March 2014. Conclusion of the inquests was as follows:,"Mr Tilbury was driving his Ford Transit Van at approximately 21:50 on 28 June 2013. As he approached a bend in the road at Crow Lane (approximately 80 metres from where Crow Lane meets Whalebone Lane, South) he lost control of his vehicle and hit the trief kerb on the offside of the road. (This section of Crow Lane is a single carriageway). The trief kerb deflected the vehicle across the road to the south footway where he mounted the pavement and collided with Miss Brown, causing her fatal injuries. His van then continued through the chain link fence, collided with a tree and slid down an embankment. Mr Tilbury was not wearing a seatbelt and he died at the scene. Miss Brown suffered a fatal injury to her head. She was taken to the Royal London Hospital but died in the early hours of 29 June 2013. Mr Tilbury was found to have levels of alcohol of 225mg/100ml (the legal limit for driving is 80mg/100ml). He was also found by the Collision Investigator to have been travelling at a speed in excess of 40mph. The speed limit on that section of the road is 30mph.","1. Evidence was heard from eye witnesses to the collision. One witness who knows the area very well stated, ""I am well used to tyres screeching in Crow Lane, people are always driving too quickly in Crow Lane."" The Senior Investigating Officer also gave evidence to confirm that local residents are concerned about speeding in that area.
2. The Collision Investigator gave evidence to confirm that in order to reduce the risk of death in the future, steps should be taken to put something physical in place, on the road, to help ensure that vehicles are travelling at the speed limit on approach to the bend. Such physical measures might be speed bumps. Another possibility that he considered was for another trief curb to be put on the south footway (mirroring the opposite curb), to deflect vehicles away from the pavement and back into the road.
3. The Senior Investigating Officer also confirmed that measures should be taken to slow vehicles down. She confirmed that physical measures, such as speed bumps, would be of greater value than illuminated or other signs.
4. The presence of the trief curb had a causative impact upon the death of Lauren Brown. It was the presence of the trief curb which deflected the Ford Transit Van onto the south footway where the collision with Miss Brown occurred. Evidence was heard that the presence of the trief curb is necessary to prevent vehicles that are travelling at speed from ending up on the railway line. This was the reason why the trief curb was put in place. Again, an eyewitness commented that ""on the right hand side of the road is a raised concrete kerb. This is there to stop people from crashing through the fence and onto the railway line. I remember the road before this kerb was here and people would come round the bend too quickly and end up on the rails."" The Collision Investigator also confirmed that one of his colleagues had dealt with a fatal case where a driver had crashed onto the railway lines. The trief curb therefore appears to be appropriately located. Had Mr Tilbury been travelling at the required speed of 30mph, the trief curb would not have posed a risk to him or Miss Brown.",False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,<NA>,Pedestrian

The conclusion of the inquest was road traffic collision, the medical cause of death being blunt head injury.","Mr Aldridge was the driver of a motor car involved in a collision with a second vehicle on the A4 near Woolhampton in West Berkshire.

The A4 at the scene is a dual carriageway and the vehicles appeared to have come together side by side and, despite a relatively slight impact, Mr Aldridge’s vehicle left the road and crashed into a tree.

At the time of the contact between the two vehicles, the other vehicle was preparing to turn into a service road separated from the A4 by a paved area and wooden fencing. There are gaps in this divide to allow vehicular access and egress to and from the service road.","(1) For a vehicle to turn into the service road running parallel to the A4 it would be necessary to slow considerably and then effect the manoeuvre. It is not possible to make a complete manoeuvre round to the left without then forming a u-turn which is not possible without either reversing and going forward again or encroaching onto the outside lane of the A4 to make a sweeping manoeuvre into the access.

(2) In the course of the evidence, the Collision Investigator who investigated the crash on behalf of Thames Valley Police suggested that the ability to make such a manoeuvre on a fast dual carriageway is potentially dangerous. While the Officer expressed concerns about turning in, he was also concerned about vehicles pulling out of the service road onto the dual carriageway.

An inquest was opened on 23 May 2013 and was concluded on 16 January 2014","On 14 May 2013 Ryan was admitted, as an informal patient, onto the Rowan Ward at the Meadowfield Hospital, Worthing suffering from an undiagnosed mental health condition. On 20 May 2013 Ryan was being accompanied by a peer support worker from the ward to a pottery class. When he got to the reception area of the hospital he took off, left the hospital and ran towards the A27 road. Witnesses then saw Ryan running along the pavement alongside the road when for no reason he changed direction and ran straight out in front of the articulated lorry. It appeared that this was a deliberate act.

Ryan subsequently died on 22 May 2013 at Southampton Hospital from the injuries he had sustained. The cause of death that was reported was that he had died from 1a Catastrophic brain injury and 1b Polytrauma.","1. During the course of the evidence it was shown that there was a lack of understanding by staff of the Trust's Leave for Non-detained Patients Policy.
2. Staff seemed unclear as to whether or not this policy should be applied when patients left the ward to attend activities within the hospital grounds. If it was to be applied then it was not strictly adhered to in Ryan's case. The nurse in charge did not carry out an assessment, as required under para 4.5, of Ryan at the time he left the ward.
3. Staff appeared to be unclear as to the role of a peer support worker with regards to whether or not they are able to fulfil the role of an escort for patients leaving the ward. The peer support worker who gave evidence indicated that she did not consider herself an escort but she was a responsible adult who accompanied patients. In Ryan's case the doctor had approved his leave only when accompanied by an escort. The terminology used in the policy causes this confusion.
4. Ryan's risk assessment and health care plan was not completed within the required period. This plan was completed two days after it should have been.
5. There was lack of written information provided to families by the hospital on admission to help them support their family member. It appears that this information is at present only given to the patient. In addition the family were not provided with a copy of Ryan's care plan.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 January 2014. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative verdict, the medical cause of death being pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome due to aspiration during a debridement operation for an infected injury to the right leg. A copy of the narrative verdict is attached.","Mrs Nutbeam was struck by a car in the car park of Sainsbury’s Supermarket in Cobham, Surrey on 28 June 2013 while a pedestrian. She suffered a degloving injury just above her right ankle but no broken bones. She was treated in St. Peter’s Hospital with a follow up appointment with plastic surgeons at Wexham Park Hospital to treat the leg wound.

On 9 July, Mrs Nutbeam attended St. Peter’s Hospital with abdominal discomfort and vomiting. Staff at St. Peter’s rearranged an appointment that Mrs Nutbeam had for the same day, 9 July, at Wexham Park Hospital, the new appointment being two days later.

Mrs Nutbeam attended Wexham Park Hospital on 11 July and the following day was taken to theatre for a debridement procedure as the leg wound had become infected. Treating clinicians at Wexham Park Hospital were not made aware of the recent vomiting episodes and treatment at St. Peter’s Hospital on 9 July nor that, after admission to Wexham Park Hospital, she had continued to vomit. There was no record in the nursing notes.

During the surgery at Wexham Park Hospital on 12 July, Mrs Nutbeam vomited and aspirated. Despite subsequent treatment in Intensive Care, she passed away and a post mortem examination revealed pneumonia superimposed on Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome which the pathologist concluded was a direct consequence of the aspiration following the debridement procedure.","(1) Staff at St Peter’s Hospital did not contact Wexham Park Hospital to advise of the recent admission, treatment and symptoms even though they were on notice that Mrs Nutbeam had a follow up appointment at Wexham Park Hospital some two days later because they arranged that appointment. Concern is the apparent lack of any procedure to allow information to be transferred between different Trusts in different Counties. There was no letter given to Mrs Nutbeam to accompany her to the subsequent appointment.

(2) Despite clear evidence from the family that Mrs Nutbeam was vomiting on the ward shortly before her debridement procedure, there is no reference in the nursing notes and this information was not made known to the Anaesthetist nor Surgeon. The fact that she was vomiting prior to a surgical procedure should have been a matter of serious concern.

(3) The evidence given at the Inquest was that if the Anaesthetist/Surgeon had been aware of the vomiting symptoms, the procedure would have been deferred to investigate the cause of the vomiting. This may have prevented aspiration during the surgery.

(4) It was also given in evidence at the Inquest that, when the Anaesthetist visited Mrs Nutbeam prior to the surgery and explained the procedure, the risks and took her consent, he did not ask her if she had vomited within the last twenty four hours. The evidence was that this is not a standard question to ask of patients ahead of surgery.

The question is posed as to whether this should become a standard question that is asked of patients prior to going to procedure as, if it had been asked on this occasion, the lack of information from St Peter’s Hospital and the absence of any reference to vomiting in the nursing notes would still have come to the attention of the treating Clinicians.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 September 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was Accident. The medical cause of death was found to be: 1a Multiple injuries including cardiac tamponade and flail chest. 1b Road traffic accident.","The evidence in this case related to a road traffic collision that took place at around lunchtime on 14 October 2012 at the junction of the A657 Saltaire Road, and Victoria Road in Saltaire, near Shipley. The deceased was travelling on his motorcycle southbound on Victoria Road towards the junction of these two roads. Although the deceased was a Swedish national and was here in the UK visiting his family; he was familiar with the road on which he was travelling. He approached the junction at a speed of approximately 38 mph (as calculated by the Collision Investigator), which was slightly in excess of the speed limit of 30 mph. At the mouth of the junction (approached whilst travelling in a southerly direction) there is a STOP sign (a red octagonal sign on a yellow background). The deceased did not appear to see the junction until too late when a car driven by [REDACTED] which had stopped at the pelican crossing on the A657 Saltaire Road to allow pedestrians to cross, traversed slowly from west to east in front of him on the A657 Saltaire Road, causing Mr Nilsson to brake heavily before his motorcycle slid out from under him. The motorcycle crossed over the junction coming to rest on the other side, barely catching the rear of the car. Mr Nilsson was not so fortunate. He slammed into the side of the vehicle and suffered catastrophic injuries from which he died minutes later.","1. There are a number of factors which could, in my opinion, have caused or contributed to this fatality. Victoria Road is an absolutely straight road which is aligned in almost a perfect north-south direction. It is a wide avenue type of road, with large trees visible on both the east and west pavements. On both sides of the road there are parking bays, and the cars are able to park fully on the road, whilst still leaving ample room for cars to pass in both directions. The layout is the same on both sections of Victoria Road – both before and after it is bisected by the A657 Saltaire Road. There is a gradient of approximately 1:7 stretching uphill from north to south. The slope of the road is only interrupted by the A657, which is perfectly level, but due to the slope of the road, it is not seen until the driver is approximately 20 metres from the junction. Moreover, due to the slope of the road, the STOP sign and stop line painted on the road is only really visible when the driver is approximately 20 metres from the junction. The overall layout of the road (i.e. it being perfectly straight with a sort of symmetrical appearance on both sides) contrives to almost create an optical illusion. The driver’s eye is drawn to the horizon in the centre – and as such, the STOP sign at the mouth of the junction is only in the driver’s peripheral vision.

2. I am concerned that the overall layout of this junction was a substantial contributing factor to this fatal accident.

3. I am concerned that the STOP sign is not clearly visible in its current

4. Furthermore, I understand from the evidence which was given to me that this is the only junction on the entire length of Victoria Road where the driver does not have right of way. It is possible that Mr Nilsson became confused as to where he was on Victoria Road.

5. I understand that since this fatal incident occurred, the Council has cut down the large tree next to the STOP sign at the junction, however it is my belief that the tree played no part in this accident.

Cartwright,Derby and Derbyshire,The Peak District National Park Authority,On 28 January 2013 an investigation was commenced into the death of David Allan Cox. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which took place on 4 October 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was accidental death. The medical cause of death was 1a death due to immersion.,"Shortly after 8.30am on 24 January 2013 David Allan Cox was driving his Toyota Aygo vehicle registration [REDACTED] from his home along an unclassified single track bridleway at Blackwell Mill, Derbyshire between Blackwell Mill Cottages and Wye Dale Car Park at Topley Head.

Driving conditions were poor, the bridleway being covered in compacted snow and ice. David Allan Cox was driving at a slow speed as he approached the second over bridge as the bridleway bends 90 degrees sharply to the left. At the bend the vehicle ran wide onto the steep riverbank to the offside sliding down and rolling onto its roof into the river below.

David Allan Cox was trapped in his vehicle for some 45 minutes and life was subsequently pronounced extinct at Stepping Hill Hospital.

Present in Mr Cox's vehicle was also his daughter who managed to escape.

I heard evidence at inquest that shortly after Mr Cox's vehicle entered the water, [REDACTED] vehicle which was being used to drive their son to school also left the bridleway at the same location on the bend and her vehicle also slipped down the steep slope of the river bank and overturned into the river below.

My investigation revealed that the track at the point of the bend where the two vehicles left the road is ninety degrees to the left and is extremely narrow and acute with no margin for error.","The matters of concern are as follows and relate to the track at the point of the bend where the vehicles left the track on 24 January 2013 being extremely narrow and acute, leaving no margin for error and creating a risk of other vehicles leaving the track and sliding down the river bank into the river below due to the absence of any barrier.

There is no barrier or wall along the length of the bridleway between the track and the river and I had confirmed in evidence that there are in total three blind bends along the length of the bridleway. The presence of two further blind bends along the same track also causes me concern.

Hassell,London Inner North,Mr Boris Johnson Mayor of London; Greater London Authority,"On 26 October 2011, my predecessor, Andrew Scott Reid, commenced an investigation into the death of Brian Robert Dorling. I concluded the investigation by way of a two day inquest finishing on 15 October 2013.

On 10 July 2013, one of my assistant coroners, Richard Ian Brittain, commenced an investigation into the death of Philippine Marthe Anne Marie de Gerin-Ricard. I concluded the investigation by way of a one day inquest on 16 October 2013.

In both cases I concluded that death was an accident, in Mr Dorling’s case adding a narrative to this.","Both Mr Dorling and Ms de Gerin-Ricard died when the pedal cycle each was riding was involved in a collision with a heavy goods vehicle. Both were cycling on Cycle Super Highway 2 in London. Ms de Gerin-Ricard was riding a Barclays bicycle.

Mr Dorling was cycling across Bow roundabout when a tipper truck on his outside turned left across his path and the two collided. Mr Dorling was on a blue strip that was not edged with a white line and was therefore not a cycle lane.

Ms de Gerin-Ricard was cycling along Whitechapel High Street just in front of a lorry in the driver’s blind spot, having approached from the pavement on the inside, when first impact occurred.","1. Whilst the cycle super highways have been implemented with a range of measures that many cyclists have found helpful, the unbordered blue strips that have been painted on some roads are confusing.

I heard evidence that many cyclists and motorists simply do not appreciate that such a blue strip without a white line border (whether unbroken or broken) is not a cycle lane.

Whilst research has been carried out into the effect of the cycle super highways, no research has been carried out specifically into the effect of unbordered blue strips.

The confusion has the following potential consequences.

• Cyclists wrongly assume (as Mr Dorling may have done) that they have priority, and are lulled into a false sense of security.

• Cyclists believe that they have to ride on the blue strips, which may not be the correct position for them to assume in particular circumstances, most particularly when going round a roundabout.

• Motorists’ awareness of the possible presence of cyclists is raised, but they expect these cyclists to be on the blue strips, which the cyclists may not be if they are assuming the safest position, particularly when going round a roundabout.

• When the strips are painted within a lane that is plainly not wide enough to accommodate vehicular and cycle traffic, motorists may form the incorrect view that they have to stay out of the strip and so straddle lanes, rather than simply overtaking a cyclist at the appropriate time.

• Alternatively, motorists may drive over the blue strips, which they are perfectly entitled to do, but then get into the habit of driving over coloured strips, and not notice when these are actually bordered by white lines and so are cycle lanes. Thus, cyclists riding in cycle lanes elsewhere in London and the rest of the country, are put in greater danger.

2. It seems that, despite the efforts already made, more work could usefully be undertaken to educate cyclists (and motorists) about safer riding techniques.

For example, it may seem counter intuitive to some cyclists to take the lane, in other words not always to ride over to the left of the lane, but sometimes more towards the middle. However, sometimes this is the safest option.

And most especially, the dangers of a cycle overtaking vehicular traffic on the inside in the approach to a junction, cannot be over stressed.

Public information advertising in cycle shops, on websites, or even on television, could assist in changing the culture in this respect.

3. The junction of Whitechapel High Street and Commercial Street in London E1 (where Ms de Gerin-Ricard sustained her fatal injuries) remains difficult to negotiate.

As I am sure you are aware, innovative solutions need to be considered, whether this be in terms of infrastructure or other.

For example, I note that in York there is currently a trial of the Cycle Alert system, where an HGV can be fitted with a sensor that detects the presence of a cycle also so fitted, the cycle equipment being available for as little as £5.

Harris,London Inner South,"Mr Tim Smart, Chief Executive, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; Deputy Director of Operations, Care Quality Commission; Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals",On 10 July 2010 I opened an inquest into the death of Mohammed Mozammel Chaudhury. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 2 August 2013. The medical cause of death was 1a overwhelming sepsis 1b chest and other infection 1c traumatic brain injury. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative determination.,"Mohammed Chaudhury suffered multiple injuries from a traffic collision on 7 September 2009. He was cared for in Kings College Hospital initially in ITU when he was immobile due to fractured pelvis and was at high risk of bed sores due to minimal consciousness, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes and PEG feeding. He was transferred to a step down ward without pressure sores on 27 September. There he developed a number of infected pressure sores, which were due to not being nursed on an air mattress for three weeks and insufficient turning due to shortage of nursing staff. He was transferred to a nursing home with five pressure sores between grades 2 and 4, which were septic.","(1) Infected pressure sores may have been a cause of death and they were unusual in extent and severity. Their development was prevented in ITU when he was most at risk and considerable improvement was achieved in the nursing home after discharge. Their development and deterioration related to nursing care on Murray Falconer ward in KCH between 27 September and 9 December.

(2) Professional evidence confirmed that this was due to failure to turn regularly. Two hourly turning was required, although this was not prescribed by tissue viability nurses or doctors. There were missing care plans, gaps in plans and delays in referral to TVN. Waterlow scoring was not consistent. Days were recorded when there were only 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 turns per day. NICE guidance was not being followed. Some improvements in training and reporting have been reported since.

(3) Nursing rotas for the period were not available. Some days were reported as below establishment. (8 by day and 6 by night for 31 patients of which at least a quarter were high dependency). Not all bank shifts were filled.

(4) Although the ward has since been restructured and takes different cases, it was not possible to conclude that current staffing levels in the hospital for unconscious patients requiring regular turning were safe, as comparisons were difficult and the judgement required professional and managerial opinion.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,<NA>,Male,Not known

Gittins,North Wales (East and Central),The Association of British Insurers; DVLA; VOSA,On 24 July 2012 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sadie Ann Jane McGrady aged 6. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 August 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was Accidental Death and the medical cause of death was blunt force head injury as a result of a road traffic collision.,"On 22 July 2012 Sadie was a rear seat passenger in a Vauxhall Corsa motor vehicle registration number [REDACTED] driven by her mother [REDACTED]. Her mother drove this vehicle out of a junction and across a dual carriageway into the path of an oncoming vehicle which then struck the vehicle in which Sadie was travelling, colliding with its offside.

The collision resulted in a significant intrusion of the “B” pillar and rear quarter wing into the vehicle impacting with Sadie’s head causing severe head injuries which resulted in her death.","(1) Evidence was given by [REDACTED] Advanced Police Vehicle Examiner indicating that the Vauxhall Corsa was the subject of a category D, total loss insurance claim in 5/2008, the insurance claim relating to (inter alia) a crumpled rear offside sill member and adjacent quarter panel and a dented driver’s door. Various repairs had been undertaken to the vehicle and the examiner was concerned by the quality of the repair to the rear offside quarter panel. He noted that it did not comply to the recognised industry repair method and was substandard as there had been unnecessary removal of the complete spot weld resulting in the separation of all 3 panels forming part of the laminated “B” pillar structure and inadequate quality and insufficient mig welding to attach the replacement quarter panel compromising the integrity of the “B” pillar structure.
(2) The consequence of this substandard repair undoubtedly resulted in greater intrusion into the passenger cell when the vehicle was subjected to a severe broadside impact, which in turn may have increased the likelihood of the occupants sustaining serious injury.
(3) The evidence of [REDACTED] Home Office Forensic Pathologist, indicated that the head injuries sustained by Sadie were the result of her head impacting against the intruded rear quarter panel and had this not intruded so much as a result of the collision then it is possible that she may not have sustained such severe head injuries and may well have survived the collision.
(4) Forensic Collision Investigator [REDACTED] indicated in his evidence that in circumstances where there had been a category D write off, there were no independent checks undertaken on repaired vehicles before they returned to the road and that the MOT process would be unlikely to establish that the structure/integrity of a damaged vehicle had been compromised by a substandard repair.
(5) The above matters give rise to a concern that there exists the uncontrolled sale and repair of insurance write offs as a result of which future deaths may occur when previously written off vehicles are back on the road and involved in collisions.",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,6,Female,Other

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11 July 2013. The conclusion of the inquest was accidental death and the cause of death was:
1a Drowning
1b Reduced consciousness
1c Traumatic head injury
2. Ethanol ingestion","The deceased was a front seat passenger of a Land Rover Discovery being driven along Pill Road near Rooksbridge in the early hours of 13 November 2012, at a speed of not more than 30 mph when the driver swerved to avoid a roe deer, subsequently causing the Land Rover to leave the carriageway, cross a few feet of level verge and enter the adjoining rhynne, landing on its roof.

The driver and the passenger in the rear seat were able to extricate themselves and shortly after pulled the deceased from the vehicle and placed him on the underside of the vehicle which was then lying between 2 ft and 4 ft above the water.

In the present case, although the driver was above the drink driving limit for alcohol he was however a local and knew the road well and evidence was given that his driving had not been a matter of concern to two witnesses and further that roe deer were present in the area.","That I have between one and two deaths per year from vehicles leaving the carriageway and landing in a rhynne, often resulting in the death of the occupant by drowning and therefore some action should be taken to prevent future death.

As he emerged onto Brunel Way he braked sharply as a car approached from his right. He was thrown over the handlebars. Both he and the cycle struck the side of the car. He sustained fatal injuries.","There is no barrier or restriction at the end of the footpath, such as are commonly found on footpaths or at school gates. The pavement is only some 1.5 metres wide. This means that children whether on foot or otherwise can emerge suddenly at speed straight into the line of traffic.

Taylor,London North,Traffic and Highway Network Management Department; Harrow Council,"At the inquest touching the death of Joseph Burrell heard before H.M. Deputy Coroner John Taylor at North London Coroners Court sitting at 29 Wood Street, Barnet EN5 4BE on 22 July 2013, the Deputy Coroner found that (a) the evidence at the inquest gave rise to a concern that circumstances creating a risk of other deaths would occur, or would continue to exist, in the future, and (b) in the Deputy Coroner’s opinion, action should be taken to prevent the occurrence or continuation of such circumstances, or to eliminate or reduce the risk of death created by such circumstances.","At 7:15 pm on Saturday 28 July 2012, Mr. Burrell attempted (as a pedestrian) to cross the two-lane southern carriageway of The Broadway, in Stanmore, at its junction with Church Road and Stanmore Hill. He was seen on the central reservation, next to the traffic lights, waiting to cross to the south side. At the moment when he began to cross, the traffic in the right-hand lane of The Broadway (from where it would turn into Stanmore Hill) was held on a red light, and the traffic in the left-hand lane (from where it would bear left into Church Road) was permitted to proceed through the lights, by virtue of a green filter light. As Mr. Burrell attempted to make his way across the left-hand lane, he was struck by a car proceeding through the green filter light. He died from the multiple injuries which he sustained in that collision.","A pedestrian on the central reservation has no clear view of the green filter light (particularly if there is a high-sided vehicle held stationary in the right-hand lane).

There is no ""second set"" of lights beyond the lights (as there is at many junctions) which would be easier for a pedestrian to see.

There is no ""red man/green man"" pedestrian light, or warning sound (which would indicate when it was safe to cross).

There are no control buttons for pedestrians to use (in order to bring the lights in both lanes to red).

For each and all of the above reasons, and when deciding his moment to cross, a pedestrian on the reservation cannot easily be certain whether the lights for both lanes are on red (and hence whether it is safe to cross).

The speed limit at the lights was (and is) 30mph.

A pedestrian waiting to cross may thus expose himself to risk of injury, or death, if he mistakenly believes that both lights are on red, and so chooses to cross at the time when the light for the left-hand lane is not on red, but instead on the green filter.
