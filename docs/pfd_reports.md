# More about PFD reports

Prevention of Future Death (PFD) reports are a unique, under-recognised mechanism within the English and Welsh legal system for flagging hazards that threaten lives. These documents, written by coroners at the close of certain inquests, have the potential to drive real change — but only if their warnings are heard and acted upon.

## What is a PFD report?

When a coroner concludes an inquest and believes that action should be taken to prevent future deaths, they are legally obliged (under Regulation 28 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013) to issue a PFD report. The report is sent to any person or organisation the coroner thinks could take action. This could be an NHS trust, a regulator, a private company, a local council, or even the government.

The aim is simple: to prevent further deaths by highlighting systemic risks, missed opportunities, or patterns of harm that have already claimed a life.

## What do PFD reports look like?

PFD reports tend to be short, factual documents. They usually contain:

 * The coroner’s name and area

 * The date of the reports

 * The recipient(s) of the report

 * Key details of the inquest
 
 * The circumstances behind the death

 * The coroner's concerns, explaining what went wrong and why further action is needed

These coroner concerns are the heart of PFD reporting. Between them, they contain a plethora of information on why so many deaths in England and Wales are preventable.

But formatting varies wildly. Some reports are rich with detail; others are extremely brief. Some are typed, some are scanned PDFs, and some have inconsistent metadata or missing information. Some are correctly tagged with a broad category, while others are not for no clear reason.

This variability is a big part of why working with PFDs at scale has been so difficult.


## Why do PFD reports matter?

PFD reports offer us a rare window into risks and failures that may not appear in routine data. They can expose themes including, but not limited to:

* Missed diagnoses and medical errors

* Gaps in mental health or social care provision

* Unsafe systems or environments (e.g. railway safety, housing, road design)

* Inadequate policies or regulatory oversight

Because coroners have a statutory duty to write them, PFD reports sometimes identify entirely new risks — before they turn into trends. For researchers and policymakers, they are a critical early-warning system.


## How does PFD Toolkit help?

PFD Toolkit addresses these barriers by automatically gathering, cleaning, and structuring every available PFD report — making them accessible, searchable, and ready for analysis at scale.
