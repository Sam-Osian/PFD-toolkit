## Installation

PFD Toolkit can be installed from pip as `pfd_toolkit`:

```bash
pip install pfd_toolkit
```

Or, to update an existing installation:

```bash
pip install -U pfd_toolkit

```

!!! Note
    PFD Toolkit is not currently available via Anaconda. If you'd like this to change, please make a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Sam-Osian/PFD-toolkit/issues). Personally, we love using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/) as an alternative to (Ana)conda for dependency management.
