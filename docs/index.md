## Background

**PFD Toolkit** is an open-source Python package built to transform the way researchers, policymakers, and analysts access and analyse Prevention of Future Death (PFD) reports from coroners in England and Wales.

PFD reports are vital public documents that highlight risks and drive changes to help prevent future fatalities. Yet, they remain significantly underused—largely because they are difficult to work with in practice. Barriers include:

- There being no easy way to download reports in bulk

- Inconsistent formatting that makes traditional web scraping unreliable

- No system for tracking recurring or emerging themes

- Widespread miscategorisation of reports, making analysis cumbersome


As a result, analysing PFD reports is often a slow, manual process—taking months or even years to complete.


## Features

PFD Toolkit seeks to overcome these barriers to analysing PFD reports. Features include:

1. Loading live PFD report data in seconds

2. Correcting spelling, grammar, and formatting issues

3. Query and surface reports relevant to your work, using our AI-powered search

4. Uncover recurring trends & themes using AI

5. Tag and organise reports by your own themes or sub-themes


## Installation

You can pip install PFD Toolkit like any other Python package:

```bash
pip install pfd_toolkit
```

*(Note: PFD Toolkit is not currently on Conda distributions. Reach out if you want this to change!)*


## Contribute

PFD Toolkit is a research-enabling tool, and so we want to engage with the research community as much as possible to make sure this toolkit works for you *(yes, you!)*.
