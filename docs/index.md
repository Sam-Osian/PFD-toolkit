**PFD Toolkit** is an open-source Python package built to transform the way researchers, policymakers, and analysts access and analyse Prevention of Future Death (PFD) reports from coroners in England and Wales.

PFD reports are vital public documents that highlight risks and drive changes to help prevent future fatalities. Yet, they remain significantly underused—largely because they are difficult to work with in practice. Barriers include:

- There being no easy way to download reports in bulk

- Inconsistent formatting that makes traditional web scraping unreliable

- No system for tracking recurring or emerging themes

- Widespread miscategorisation of reports, making analysis cumbersome


As a result, analysing PFD reports is often a slow, manual process—taking months or even years to complete.

## Features

PFD Toolkit seeks to overcome these barriers to analysing PFD reports. Through the toolkit, you can:

1. Easily load live PFD report data in seconds.

2. Clean reports of spelling and grammatical errors.

3. Query reports to quickly identify cases relevant to your research.

4. Use AI to uncover recurring themes within the data, across different domains and topics.

5. Organise the data by any themes/sub-themes you provide


## Installation

You can pip install PFD Toolkit like any other Python package, for example:

```bash
pip install pfd_toolkit
```

*(Note: PFD Toolkit is not currently on Conda distributions. Reach out if you want this to change!)*


## Contribute

PFD Toolkit is a research-enabling tool, and so we want to engage with the research community as much as possible to make sure this toolkit works for you *(yes, you!)*.
