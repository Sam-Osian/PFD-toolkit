# Extract information from reports

PFD Toolkit ships with an `Extractor` class to pull structured data from Prevention of Future Death (PFD) reports. The guides below walk through the main features:

- [Basic usage](basics.md) – create a feature model and choose which sections of each report are read by the LLM.
- [Summaries & token counts](summarising.md) – generate short summaries and estimate the token cost of your data.
- [Tagging reports with themes](themes.md) – label reports with your own taxonomy or automatically discover new themes.
- [Caching and exporting results](caching.md) – reuse completions to save time and money.
