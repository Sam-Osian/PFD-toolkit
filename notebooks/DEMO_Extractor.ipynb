    "#### 1. \"Can we extract age & ethnicity from PFD reports?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** There are no age or ethnicity fields in PFD reports. However, anecdotally, many coroners seem to note age in the \"Investigation & Inquest\" or \"Circumstances of Death\" sections of the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo considers whether age & ethnicity, as features, can be extracted from these reports using PFD Toolkit's `Extractor` class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Below, we:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Load a sample of reports\n",
    " * Load our OpenAI API key and create an LLM object\n",
    " * Initialise a Pydantic (BaseModel) object, which specifies the key (e.g. age), its type (e.g. int) and add in a short description.\n",
    " * Feed this to an `Extractor` instance\n",
    " * Inspect the prompt template just so that we can get an idea of what will get fed to the LLM\n",
    " * Et voila!\n"
