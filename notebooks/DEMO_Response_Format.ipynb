    "# DEMO of response format capabilities\n",
    "As you can see in the below made up example, the LLM is FORCED to produce outputs in the format laid out in the class called Test. It's important that Test inherits from Pydantic's BaseModel, as this is handled internally by the openai SDK and is also used to parse the text json output back into the class. Once you have the output object, you can access the attributes of the object like normal. The use of Typing is enforced by openai, ensuring that a string is always a string, an integer is always an integer, a List is always a list, and a Literal has to be one of the options you give it. This is perfect for ensuring LLM outputs are bulletproof in their conforming to your expected outputs, meaning that they do not break unexpectedly no matter what the input is.\n",

Irrespective of the type of meter, it is reasonably foreseeable that electricity meters need to be accessed by people from time to time and not only those with the requisite training for working at height.\\n\\n(2) Siting prepayment meters, in particular, at such a height and location adds to the risk, because those choosing to use a pre-payment meter are required to access it each and every time they top-up the meter.\\n\\n(3) The electricity company which installed the meter in 2001 has \"no records of what consideration they gave at the point of installation to the specific meter location.\" Other meters in the property are at a similar height and it is not uncommon to find electricity meters at heights requiring steps to access them; there appears to be no industry standard requiring electricity meters to be easily accessible (albeit secure) by all potential customers, except perhaps in new build properties.'} \n",

The same day, he was taken to hospital having been found intoxicated at a bridge, with suicidal ideation. He was formally sectioned under the Mental Health Act the following day and re-admitted to Hollins Park. During the admission, Adrian’s condition appeared to stabilise with changes to his medication, and he was allowed long periods of unescorted leave. By August 2017 he was awaiting a bed at Lea Court, a rehabilitation unit, and was spending the majority of the day away from the hospital. His presentation during this period did not give the hospital team or his parents cause for concern in relation to self harm/ suicidal ideation. On 9 November 2017 Adrian returned to hospital following a period of leave at his father’s house. No concerns or changes to his presentation were noted. Sadly, he was found deceased in bed the following morning, with his death confirmed at 08.50 on 10 November 2017.
